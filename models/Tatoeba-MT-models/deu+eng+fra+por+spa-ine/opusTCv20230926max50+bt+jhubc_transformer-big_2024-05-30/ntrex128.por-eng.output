Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing through Marretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) about the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political colours, fear that this will make them fall into ridicule.
A labor AM said the group is concerned that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, "twp" means "idiot" and "pwp" means "excrements".
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole “was not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which noted widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as "the Welsh Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favored "Mentioners of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favored in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include further amendments to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how they should be appointed.
Macedonians will refer to the country’s name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbor to the north constitutes a complaint over its territory, having repeatedly objected to its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin sinuses shut down at a time when Harlem churches struggle for survival
“On a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently” today, he said.
“The bars have ceased to be the neighborhood’s living rooms where people go regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the point of departure.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later occupied by a black congregation who carried out their worships in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street storeholders, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysus A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it “would seek to pass on the costs,” unfortunately not having been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Causes Injury to 13-Year-Old Teenager at Lobster Hunting Dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy screaming for help, and then roamed towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just about enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized that the boy shouted "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the claviculum was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I cried out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a 2.8 billion <0xC2><0xA3> share in the UK cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and home goods decline, these largest cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores spread across the country and will be implemented in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand on the part of supermarkets for ways to use exposure space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product catalogue with the offering of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket network is also re-launching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second one is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily amounts in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to strive more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will be more and more similar to large warehouses at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has increased sales of grocery products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the revenue distribution of health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 outlets to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby dropped 11 million pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby abandoned a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of Truly home items and accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would quit the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star livid by leaving the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the golden TV girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses (whose value can amount to 1.5 million pounds) meant that she would no longer have time to devote itself to her truly home goods and accessories brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his overseas holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
Nobody believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of items ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most lucrative vetes, could cost the company millions, given the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home goods, and the potential for further delays from the launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples take vacation together and Jones owns a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The US president jokfully mentioned the criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed in his fake voice of “tele newspaper pivot.”
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations for denuclearization are sliding.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his rally speech.
“It’s doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country from the remains of U.S. military.
In addition, he advocated his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channeling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clearly declaring that they are not seeking international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly poorly prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, unwillingly the duration of a warning, would have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, travelling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the shortage of funding has ravaged Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot for the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's beacon, with his team losing 1-0.
He touched his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed towards the upper right corner of the grid.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell inside the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched it, and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 at the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the Blues advanced gave a heel-back pass to Mateo Kovacic before demarcating near the midfield and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He surpassed the defenses and scored the goal against the net of the second beam with a left-foot shot that passed through Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool faces Naples in the Champions League group stage at three o’clock on Wednesday afternoon at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o’clock on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said earlier Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that hit 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspected murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with sharp-weapon injuries at Grayson Mews, John Street, with a 32-year-old man being detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged the population of the area who may have witnessed something to give information.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with tablier cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the site of the occurrence to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have reported that they are currently informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment but has been informed by police that entry or exit from the building is prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was left without words.
Residents are now being informed that they can only return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly states that "it's so awful."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cord and another was parked in the immediate outdoor zone.
A series of police officers were highlighted inside the cord to watch the apartment building.
We ask anyone who has information to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament became the latest monument swallowed by the dispute of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of the perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and that was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of tribute.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate description is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration.”
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a blood-cut artery, near a well in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring well.
In that pitch, he said, there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed," said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera shots show Yuan entering the market at 4:00 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police gathered evidence at the site of the incident.
Reports claim that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to shock the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a "stimulus."
"They're just kidding.
They like to kick, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rose Remnants Should Bring Broad Heavy Rain to Southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and the southwest of the U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Sunday Eastern Time, the Rosa caused 137 km/h crashes, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean moving to the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Lower California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical humidity northward into the southwest of the U.S..
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause hazardous sudden flooding, filled with debris and possibly land slurries in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in spot zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into brave rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong punctual winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy rainfall over parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small debris fillings and slippery roads.
This may be the first wet season rainfall in the region.
Some tropical rainfalls scattered in Arizona will begin in late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more scattered in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread at the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may record strong temperature variations throughout the US territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a hot beginning of October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s audience
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the rapturous testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, named to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turn: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford declared to the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh touched her while drunk and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of spectators on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audience similar to the final of an American football game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all TV stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million spectators.
Next come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator to address a Judicial Commission hearing.
The senator remained still looking to the ground while being criticized live to CNN cameras.
“I’m here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
She was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say at the commission hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a plenary vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and subsequently with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake’s choice was decisive, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “making politics” with Britain’s future and of damaging national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper's front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister's "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to cover the other side's tariffs is "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims homicide: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson from the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect of the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a statement from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the Sims and Simpson confrontation, police saying Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the site of the occurrence and stated that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, police reported that he had deadly hit Wayde with a firearm.
A bail of $350,000 was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish medical office issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a bullet injury in the head that stretched to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
Athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the area authorities for their “diligence and effort to obtain justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
This 1.98 m tall advanced grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 scores per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries us on a permanent basis,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have hit the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independentist protesters and intervention police, while thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarization referendum on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder ink, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independentist groups singing “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters who shouted “Long life for Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for mild injuries suffered in the protests, it can be read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined for independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year after police attempted to block the ongoing vote at polling tables scattered around the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re blocked,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with their most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we witness on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car strike against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car struck repeatedly at a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred at the gates and the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast at the car.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level, with Hibernian second.
Gerrard's team, which remains without a victory out of home in the first division this season, faces Hearts leaders, with an additional eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended to six games his succession of no-defeat clashes in the division, with chief coach Holt without losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the score long before the goal, as the incisive character of their game was causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself drag in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after he sneaked to find Craig Halkett's headquarters on the beacon.
The team at the house was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stop-ball games.
And that’s how the crucial goal came up.
The Rangers awarded a free and the Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable defense of the house team, and network guard Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another stop-ball play from Livingston.
Crossings continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were successively settled, and two claims of great penalty, one after Halkett's incursion on substitute Glenn Middleton and one after one hand, were refused by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - review
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and outcome for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have little changed since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for how he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall doing their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was far below these standards.
Their final play was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a sort of warning to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan welcomed ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked their presence in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city, near 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and a relief team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after another cyclist died in a fleeing collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the person and inform his relatives.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Injured Agents in Disorders
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The unrest, which is still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
The agents were treated for small facial injuries on site.
A prison services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind the bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what is expected early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Pink crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday to the southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
The Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, the second most serious category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass by crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or falling into the evening on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with maximums possible of 25 mm," the weather.com website said.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or its remnants is very high precipitation in Lower California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the U.S. Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding of debris in the deserts, life-threatening, and slurries in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp weapon injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m. British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock Area, police in Avon and Somerset reported.
The agents have appealed to everyone who may own cell phone footage of the happening to show up.
Trump says Kavanaugh “was the victim of Democratic Party’s malice and anger”
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s relentless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “was the victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing on his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told the crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president laterally referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment as he spoke about the importance of Republican influx to the polls in interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters tall struck the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation in their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still in their beach activities and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the incident,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to mitigate the effect of Indonesia’s catastrophes (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not moving alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal town continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the huge shock on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement read.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the broken buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage may be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities have stated that the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage released on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of a building screaming frenzied warnings that the tsunami is approaching, for people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power shutdown that disrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, however the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
While he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, staff at Donggala’s World Vision have crossed scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as the aid groups began to start the dark task of assisting victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff may only have access to the site if it is declared a "national catastrophe zone".
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “OK, this is a national catastrophe,” we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
On the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuated the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of the imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said in the hours after news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu athletes, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only one grey checkmark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While busy, another man "rise up running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known by Kanye West.”
West, 41, received the nickname of Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it by "emotional reasons," the creator of the show said.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for him a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So, I am you, I am us, we are.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one," for just Ye - being only a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed names.
Sean Combs was alternately known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without caps and large letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador pledged not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
US To Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
At a time when China is strengthening its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double its research spending in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee investor and professional, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next major AI success will be achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's highest-ranked American player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was chairman of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Department of Defense Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next in order to help identify upcoming visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work in AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to AI doctorates," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
In terms of NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that intended to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the country's change of name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether voting will be enough to fulfill the necessary 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum’s question was, “Is it in favor of entry into NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in agencies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians said it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election committee said there had been no records of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the country’s change of name, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a head raised and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said entry into NATO would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favor, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major failure in the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all Brighton defense toward goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him seem ridiculously easy at his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine advanced received a midfield pass at the beginning of the game.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to hit the open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
Finished a defense before neutralizing others in the race within the limits of Brighton's large area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch on the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is debating some problems in his feet," Pep Guardiola, City coach, told reporters.
"We talked that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial edge in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right in Brighton territory in this game.
He passed over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues advanced kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies' lives harder.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to get on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right-wing player goes at 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resistant and obstructing.”
“And they’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “aggressive, evil, sordid and liars.”
The president referred to by the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received sounds from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Caused the leak of the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise for me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest in a series of Labour members in parliament to whom we have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because she has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged as to whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as the colleagues with whom I thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect a shift from me and that I would take positions with which I would never agree - whether they were on national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and no matter what I really say), there follows a torrent of insults on social media that call for “fire”, denounce the center’s policies, telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who goes through this.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never retreat to them.
One of the aspects that disappoint me most in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of "censorship" or change of selection rules the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advice over the past two years urging myself to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that it would "go well" for me.
But that’s not why I came to do politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those in need of them, whether as mayor or as minister in the government.
I have never concealed my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somehow confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of “firedown” or political records will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe is the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow sent the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only of ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr at the forefront, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, assigned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before the mid-time, scoring and then converting a solo rehearsal to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr to break.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from bedroom abroad and, after the restart, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a Stafford McDowall essay converted by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure invest.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for throwing down Climo without the ball, on the penalty throw, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's maul in progress.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick of David Armstrong and sent the wing Gregor Henry for the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the catering industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with long-standing comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which is coming soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was planning to engage in the “flowering Glasgow restoration business.”
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval base covered with cords in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a sea-blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon have the motto: "The sea is ours by law.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the yearning to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice judgment on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be witnessing the TIJ’s judgment on giant screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has also a lot at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” were the president’s votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court rules in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even otherwise.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s judgment is delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
“The issue of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to surpass the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without trusting the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation will never give up on its nuclear weapons if it doesn’t trust Washington first.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy in a stalemate, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that the ongoing sanctions and the US objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country sees likely as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which astonished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very unpractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like tab that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry screwed watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, although the same were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high sewing.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion claim, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats are on their way to a shop near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61-cm tab that has been worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat that spread over social networks sent another great creation to the walkways: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model in swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, adorned with raffle stripes and a white leather handle, was the most outstanding piece of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags coming to stores for next summer. Once the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend pursued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of conceiving and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can not only rely on English when we intend to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS ranking, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A score.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17 per cent were concerned with lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life-skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit proportion, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The proficiency of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with a better chance of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future reserves for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is over for fans who intend to see LeBron James start in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Following the trainings earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game schedule in the pre-season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote waiting for his chosen for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen support for the midterm elections to be held soon as Republicans are at risk of losing Congressional control after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below on a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, named to the Supreme Court, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The planned vote of confirmation in the Senate will be waiting for a week as the FBI proceeds to investigate.
However, the main goal of this stream of rallyes is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallyes next week aim to “give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the agitation of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening gathering will be able to attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage from the Pittsburgh area,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrissey, disadvantaged in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to help him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows they have strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the impetus is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now are four, so we're looking at it as a little boost, I'd say," Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is at the edge, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those gutural screams of celebration were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match on the 15th produced in a similar scream, that kind that reveals he still believes the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup revelation.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and can't mistake.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European victory in the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech about Europe’s glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, as a team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in front nine put the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely due to the interaction between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in teams so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose edge after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday’s matches with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari’s inspired duet led the load with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty reaching the four-point Le Golf National ranking so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to preserve the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winning games, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points in the singles on Sunday 12 to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the edge, defeating a powerless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the top men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a courageous 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, the title holder, only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says ‘not to think’ of unilateral disarmament without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was aggravating distrust towards the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally waive its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the world agency that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear testing facility and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we do not see any corresponding U.S. response,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, his statements appear to be meaningful insofar as they do not line-uply reject unilateral denuclearization, as opposed to Pyongyang’s previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, opposing to ‘the declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust.”
He did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the stakeholder in this issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea’s rockets towards U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “the rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to proceed until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for it, saying “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must proceed vigorously until the denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to strangle North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program financing.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and declared after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding measures."
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump took in Singapore as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep longer, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in "directs" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students at the top of the world ranking often had no idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?’
The young woman said no one had ever mentioned her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dorm where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect in bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing direct” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fat, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemistry biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his lessons last year in the first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm when going to bed, as well as waking up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal over Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another access of sadness outside the home when Dolly Menga's attack caused the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team sought to record their first victory in their course since the 1-0 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving their team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now descending to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind Hibernian for the difference in goals.
And even more problems may arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence has been treated for a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted by the way his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in each game.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored just at two minutes when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor beacon, but the middleman wasted his great opportunity out.
A long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed to just finish out towards the second bar.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than the belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been granted a great penalty for the quarter of an hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers got only two beacon kicks in the first part, but former Ibrox's Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, the more not for their tenacity.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with a Jacobs long-stop ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making a long pass behind a long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a major penalty when he blew into Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues to count ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Fundamental piece of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these earphones on, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, you're really crepiting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still persists.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and also colorectal cancers," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching them” how to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stuck in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for the presidential election in 2020.
After performing his evening song, named Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he started a bravata against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.”
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's bravata scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
I was told, "Don't go over there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying, "I'd put on my superman coat, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
Their comments have provoked public harassment and the SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, having someone from the show told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with performing the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FUNCTIONING THE TURBE.”
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply “to be what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is hosting and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now “the one that was previously known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought to the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
Star of the War of Thrones Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fencing player as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such screen roles make boys feel often that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie in the War of Thrones, has admitted that he has a "fairly strong position" on the approach to the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they are growing in terms of the problem we’re witnessing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to his very male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels to the War of Thrones when the series ends next summer, referring to the end of the "battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will participate in Sam Shepard’s True West re-edition, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-awarded fantasy series.
The couple gave the node in June 2018 on Leslie’s family’s property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases come from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information of three U.S. Senate members on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court.
The information leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded charge is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denying is collisive,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging stance.
You can't question the accuser's reasons.
He has to show calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will compete for Waters in the interim election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure that the guilty will be disclosed," he continued, "and will be legally liable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Weak Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new movie with a British flavor, and this seems indeed to apply to the new edition of the comedy and action series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satirism on the topic of being so bad the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes bubbled and an excessively elastic expression, obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-Anglophone filmmakers.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV advertisements for Barclaycard, which left chaos on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a carillon noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007s and the Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s mute movie numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the ever-current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the service agent's dismay, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument doesn’t give much material for big flights.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that's the bastard Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a chic school, but giving non-official lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, as English offers us a spy academy in the style of the "Rock School" movie.
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, trailed to a submarine commander, a furious character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of Catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously enchanted by the charismatic billionaire of technologies who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough initiate their odyssey of absurd, ruthless acts: disguised as a waiter, they burn a vivid French restaurant, create confusion penetrating as clandestine on the luxurious Volta yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this latest sequence, but as friendly and stormy as it may be, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to her talent?
Labourers deny that they are creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day working week, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the boss to pass on the savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, granting them an additional day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources say that the idea would “adapt” to the party’s economic program, which reorients the country in favour of the workers.
The move to a four-day working week obtained the union congress’s favourable opinion as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We expect to announce a policy revision before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "speculators" of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees on the company’s boards of directors and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who will be able to pay dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can make them or not change their minds
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing," he said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation appeared, and I asked him, "You did it?"
He was determined, determined, unmistakable.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems invariable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denying,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event featuring an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Central Park’s Greater Lawn, not only to watch performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group hoping to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to increase awareness to the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or this is just another case of “click” – do we think it makes a difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
The Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them already being disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions under pressure on the UK to improve mothers and children’s nutrition, the government announced it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replies: “It was a long and crooked path – sometimes we fall and fail.
But just like the great movements for civil rights and anti-apartheid that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform at this year’s New York event, featuring Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US May Use Navy as 'Block' to Put a Hind to Russian Energy Exports - Interior Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington may turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, namely where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to exploit new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they intend to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to carry out blockages to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to the fact that they are actually the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “magic one-trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline aims to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, senior head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for the presidency following the interim election.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the top responsible,” The Hill said.
“After November 6, I will deeply consider the possibility of applying for the presidency.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “to lead the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m extremely worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a tough vowel critic of Trump and his nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not apply, according to a poll by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support their application.
The survey revealed greater support for a nomination by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential nomination and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names discussed regarding a potential nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what is going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually going back with,” he told the public at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and stated that his son and other veterans “return a little differently, return hardened, return asking if there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave the country.”
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and gun possession while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the case Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner “and her children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed a 2014 Immigrant Resources Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignorates decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that police ban on immigrant entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles on a counterclock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a feverish male baby, comforting him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who broke the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most drawn newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections to Congress, a charge denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff vagues on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation by publishing advertisements in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the sweet American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid announcement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
"In contrast, at the benches here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a real reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters before interim elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could spark a negative reaction, particularly of women, during the interim elections to take place soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already stated publicly that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no retreat," give The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, to an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease the revolted voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" as they demonstrated in the Senate courtyard as Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without party affiliation, told the news website.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the nominee to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about committee voting, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38% said they considered Kavanaugh to have probably or absolutely lied in their testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford reported under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while she was alcoholic when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two participated in a party during the period when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokfully stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse”, or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is exclusively up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not introducing a total change in which all of his business models are turned backwards from day to day.
"We're not asking them for permission."

Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honour.
Her two grandchildren dropped a commemorative plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, claimed that it was "brilliously symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that gave the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Channel "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns."
Then, he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three troops from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s acts were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson of humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "a genuine hero's courage is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed Martial Arts fans awake all night to watch Bellator 206 instead watch Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206, full of vedets and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being streamed live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were astonished when coverage changed to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after being awake until early in the morning especially for the fighting.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad-taste joke.”
“Government regulations say the content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule,” said Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications manager, when asked about the broadcast.
"Suck Peppa," yes.
Bellator Chairman Scott Coker said it will rectify the schedule of broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think of repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning there and we can’t solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and not very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to exceed the fans' expectations and exaggerated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "inferior" to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone due to his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was in favour of homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long-standing regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as a paria on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, “To this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real motive that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they sooner or later discovered their sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "catched me surprised."
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he has stated that age difference has never been a problem.
"When we went through so much when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley stated that "their whole perspective" had changed.
“If I had been asked last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London Games because he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be here to be in the front row, dad," he said.
"I was holding him non-hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving before a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - with which he had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m.
Mickelson down in shape at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when playing his 47th match in a Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his form to prevent the score from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the 12th-year biennial event, a record stake, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been on the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men’s top championships split the day between supporting and playing on the field, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Having never hit the most straight even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the rough long normally punishes the wandering hits.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, will face accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 single matches, have a good start, Mickelson’s match may prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could affirm much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, kicked me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given these teams a lot in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to proceed.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of matches played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never equated the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and spirited, he likes to play with people and he’s an excellent person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun playing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear in a moment
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that his relaxed leadership by entering the last day of singles at the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Dane had his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point edge over the Americans, but crossed the goal line with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable edge in Valderrama; we had a big edge in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just about," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 Turnover victory 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So the story has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn’t over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scorecard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus should remain.
I’ve always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never join myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What matters tomorrow are the individual performances and this involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message we need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and do the best of himself too.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek his players to perform better individually than as partners, making exceptions to Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe removed the "Miracle in Medinah" from the card.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, the pressure is very great in these mid-gaps.
We have organized our staff accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the scheme.
"I chose this group of players by this order because I believe it covers the entire trajectory," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship postponed once again
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War time warships, but it will have to wait at least until next year due to systems prone to failures and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry to service of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the commanding ship of the newest Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-boarding missiles, as well as some stealing technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include extended periods between maintenances, which would allow the latest fregates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the ongoing delays made that with the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a series of crucial “hardware and software defects” that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent required for the oldest fregates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" has twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems of the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time as older ships were put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the navy.
National Trust spy on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out at a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to make some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by National Trust for Scotland scientists, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to follow the activities of bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the conservation of the NTS nature, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow farming, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect dorms and scarce habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, together with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is by them used a sophisticated echo tracking technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspections in dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still a lot about bats that we don’t know, so the work we’ve done here and in other properties will help us learn more about what they need to bloom.”
He emphasized the importance of checking if there are bats before maintaining the properties, as the unintended destruction of only one maternity dorm can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are revengeing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” stating that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that it will then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads the Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the winner of five Golden Balls told the chamber.
“They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy home and it’s all right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he violated her annually, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy," harmed by the "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she addressed the police and possessed photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would "repent forever" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Corporate Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderfully at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a deal.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be border disturbances, which the sector says could lead to delays and spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said May's "Checks Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated accurately to avoid these border checks."
“We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizure by us of this opportunity,” BBC Radio 4 told Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it was not able to provide an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite trade union at this site, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "added another week" given that there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the President’s possible obstruction of justice.
The fact that Trump could be preparing for the deputy attorney general’s dismissal, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording the conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not fire” Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press adviser Sarah Sanders has participated in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be delayed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more sessions of questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without gathering evidence: "We analyzed those numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this often, and we've seen that we've done it in recent weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Alone press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing relaxedly and sometimes bizarrely before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to consider applying for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Over the course of the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without a deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defense Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He approached the sideline and practically fainted,” Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying him on a cot and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five placements on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his season total to 18 placements.
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when buying properties in the UK
The Conservative Party announced plans to collect a higher seal tax on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in homelessness aid.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters
The seal tax increase will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
A higher seal tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in homelessness aid, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The seal tax rise will affect people and companies that are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge – added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second housing and lease purchases – could rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-home buyers to access the market.
Many thriving areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a seal tax cut to help young people acquire their first housing.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up land they do not use, demanding that Ms. May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve the "disgrace of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the end of "unjustified" evictions.
It also wants to give the municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their life here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as well as for British resident workers.
Too many people’s dream of owning their home has become too far away and the shame of sleepers remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's selector.
The 42-year-old Scott has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the club of the northeast, now third-ranked in the First League, at three leading points.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such consecrated names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the moment, the success is just "Can I get the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League.”
"It will not be easy to get the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I achieved that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as a Deputy Dumbarton coach and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of a coach than in the role of a player.
It sounds weird because it went well, I earned my life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be too hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and position pressures, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do it, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt in my adult life.”

The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups saw a 2.7% growth in sales in July, but the occupancy of restaurants decreased 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good weather and longer than expected career in the World Cup soccer led to the June standard, in which pubs recorded a 2.8% sales growth, to repeat in July, but restaurants saw a retreat.
The 1.8% decline in restoration sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business by far performed best, with a counterpart growth that more than offset the drop of restaurants.
Pubs with the meal-based business also encountered difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals dropping 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst for the RSM leisure and restoration sectors, said: “These results prolong the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors that influence the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual decline in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long and warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only the weather will show if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the much desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowing the launch of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hide their parents’ secret accounts on social media
One in five children – some aged only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, a study revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth in “fake” Instagram pages
The news exacerbates fears about publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children – some only 11 years old – creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account innocuous to show their parents, while at the same time owning private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter discovered that the teenager incited others to "rape her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Regulator’s Annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and hopefully to be able to truly contribute to help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, has failed to walk after suffering a transient ischaemic stroke.
As she wrote on Twitter: “It was a month ago that I suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I achieved a total recovery, I re-learned to walk and I already do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk extraction pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company divided opinions online with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk extraction pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom given by the new bomb to mothers extracting milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacuum to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have breasts, these are my breasts."
The saying goes on, "Pumps, pumps, feeds the babies, pumps, pumps, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page has generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from spectators, with many saying it alleviates the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born,” she wrote.
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Understandingly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction bomb for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted to find the song "hilariant."
"I think the idea is genial.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but it makes sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at workplace) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, grab their babies and even leave the house while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women extracting milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting it in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time that the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two marched on the bridge to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children displaced discreetly to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, despite the monthly crossings of the border remaining relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to parenting children.
Traditionally, most of the "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godfathers and other adults who integrate their households would have to register their fingerprints, and the data was shared with immigration regulatory authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the service had detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal history.
“About 80 percent of the sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them being foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, employees have introduced new rules that require some of them to file for court within a month from the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to hospital staff.
Many are present by video conference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered uneligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or attempts to escape, according to hospital staff and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the larger dimension contributes to ignoring signs of child disturbance.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is nearly over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions still displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were assured, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that led the refugees to remain abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria’s reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last large rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target Jihadists, including al-Nusra-associated al-Qaeda front fighters, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited “to the review of the articles of the current constitution” and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the contestation and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In that which would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, noble-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million noble-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“This is a strong strike for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designed Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He recalls once he called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Naturally, unlike television shows, stories coming from Washington will be able to determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family assembly of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing programs is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward's use of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", the $15,000 ostrich leather jacket by Paul Manafort ("a piece of clothing full of insolence," as the Washington Post reported) and the implications of the descriptions.
For my part, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done seems like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the plot (antagonizing the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss any episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked at home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It did not disgrunt with television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but you were right after all."

Significant external funding in interim elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th circle knows a flow of funding, thanks to a re-alignment of electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of the Pittsburg suburban circles put in the race the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which overlaps largely with the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former circles unconstitutionally favoured Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle triggered a tough dispute for funding the campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely disputed extraordinary elections in March for the 18th electoral circle of Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to the Democrats.
US Considered Penalizing El Salvador For Supporting China, Retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to cease to recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for controlling drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside every consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations under cover of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report of legal counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be guiding his investigation to determine whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to present himself again to voters and perhaps to be tried by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflexion such as this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating on his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how could you not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the match with Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in good position to qualify in the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented middle Graham Dorrans from playing the first game of the season up to two goals with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
“It was a well-earned point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We looked at the game with a positive mindset and got a point.
Perhaps we could have won near the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest outcome.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win all three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very tough, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the workouts are going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to enjoy, few people have spoken to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10 percent mentioned talking to their children about the same issue.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care unless you give them knowledge of your desires in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your continued care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a monetary-valued hybrid policy to help cover these expenses, or funding using your own savings, provided that you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney by choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a power of attorney on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you know how to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“There are not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in town.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not imply life-threatening and police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic Ring of Fire, being regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a heavy earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that fell over the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes struck Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes have destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and candidate for Vice-President, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation of domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin is preventively detained at Mat-Su's pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three class A crimes, which means he may be sentenced to a sentence of up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her child’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died in the wake of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutor calls for rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bicycle path on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification that calls for the death penalty, registered in the Southern Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder in the service of organized crime, normally used by the public prosecutor in organized crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "considerable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as "great, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
New York's Southern Zone hasn't been calling for the death penalty for a charge for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was switched to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying acts for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the indictment decision.
“We think the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to “mobilize the popular army” during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Euro skeptics, while one of May's MPs suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Rear-guard conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham demonstration that the UK "would have left" if Farage was Brexit Minister.
But the challenge faced by Ms. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists was underlined by the conservatives who advocate the stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debating to maintain her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of the attacks by Brexit supporters, advocates for the permanence and the EU.
The allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Euro skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended "to end the plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been assigned responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone," he said.
Wellingborough’s deputy added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the plan.”
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone refused the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally rude."
The conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, telling journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular among the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and among the militants who take the campaigns out to the streets and whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel pressure" if they rush to betray the decision to exit the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the brink of betraying Brexit.
“We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-ruled United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the advocates of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists wrapped up tracks with the message "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada more’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete scam.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren plans to “seriously consider” eventual presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously ponder the presidential nomination" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is nominated for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in a debate format since Trump took over.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government and that includes a woman in the top spot.”
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot down near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, following which he eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence on site, holding a gun, acknowledging he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without presenting resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and held 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and caused Hamilton to face the traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the boxing one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a swarm, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double path correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He ended up coming to the boxing in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me surpass him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, rather commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious, and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in recent days, look at the anger, see how bad people are, malignant and false,” Trump said.
"When we see the information leaks and the communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start from you?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the document?
Oh, no, no, no.
The escape did not start from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape went from us... No, it wasn’t us,” he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but he denied that the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her history,” Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denying did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "You know what more, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to resume power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, malice, no matter who they can hit, who have to step in to take over power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from the defeat on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal edge with scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie knocked out for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back ahead.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald had two goals to secure the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a twist on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following a Kendall McFaull attendance, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier raise the lead four minutes later.
In a first frenzied period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first break in the leadership, scoring their second night goal at the end of the first period.
The house team rearranged and Bouchard scored again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, host Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Controller Dies to Help Hundreds of Passengers Escape from Earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been acclaimed as a hero after dying as he ensured that a plane with hundreds of passengers would take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a heavy quake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was shaking violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained concentrated to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the track, would take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet is rising as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue,” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are carrying aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances with bodies arrive.
There is a lack of drinking water.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely rescued from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon it was unable to confirm the location of a male passenger.
The company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Official authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable clinical picture.
It is still unclear what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the track and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
“It was the best thing that happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag the water through the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said the board attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby wet improvement work also helped rescue by turning to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks at 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstitute the movements of the 20-year-old accused Quintom Tellis, and the victim Jessica Chamber, 19, on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he had not been in town that day.
When the indictment asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin to file its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York Lady Prosecutes Couple for Lay-off via "racist" SMS Message
A New York-based sister is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received an SMS message from her mother complaining that she was "more black."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming the trial was an act of "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new midwife Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced her first day of work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE...ANOUNGOR A BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gafe, a "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the previous African-American midwife's poor performance and that she was waiting for a Filipino midwife.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a dismissal compensation of $350/day for the six-month period for which she was chosen without a contract.
“I want to show you that you can’t be unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent you something that I didn’t really mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children be entrusted to someone who had treated evil, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
In calling the “extortion” process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother just two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase someone like this?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process runs, the public opinion court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behaviour and reasoning.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Could Not Identify With a Speaking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s so fun to be aware of this now, after Paddington was so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little play bear writing the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bitter-sweet taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described it as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to boasting," he said.
“But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful child: we are proud even when the accomplishment is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad called and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart working were slowly ceasing to work and leaving her system.
She had died a while ago and all her organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or regret because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself back."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other trial passengers she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always cryed down with my head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning attach cards to bridge to avoid suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to prevent others from going the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any father to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it illuminated the room.”
However, he gave up work before dying because he had "dipped in the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards “to let them know that there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, even if you’re a friend.
Do not close on yourselves. You have to speak."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, very shortly after the death of her mother-in-law.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, there was a cloth, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the beginning of the FBI investigation
"I thought that by terming the resemblance to what I asked - an investigation with defined time and scope - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, advocating that he feared the committee would be "collapsing" in the face of a rooted partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your reluctance is a merely temporary issue.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their Supreme Court candidate frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met the woman Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-out vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated 1,127 desertions occurred last year compared to the 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, and they are frequently repatriated.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they generally agreed to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for lack of progress.
“Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all legacies of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a crisp, whispering voice, talking about her family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him of “grotescous and conspiracy murder” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's actual appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. District Court Relationship.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of repealing certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope we are happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it cannot unfold without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, does it?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me a lot. She told me she was crying when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it continued.
And I thought for myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in an office dominated by men, crying of inexpressible anger, being caught by an older woman — an unfriendly manager who frightened me a little — and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say.
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they've been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential candidature.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn't see why she couldn't apply herself for the presidential election.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he said laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who nicknamed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraiser was less than desirable and swore that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they would have given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she was not going to go into a formal campaign, emotions came to the top – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bringing the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism – and tears arose.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” recalled Patricia Schroeder when she spoke of the media’s reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue from the trade war between the U.S. and China was deaf, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of experts, the removal of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
U.S. President Donald Trump triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with new rates affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will waver in the coming times.
Putting Washington back would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country’s conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily livelihoods and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive help in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe wins again after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has shown to have serious difficulties almost throughout the tournament, threw his starting tee into the water in hole 16, pair 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked European team player Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England in what may have been his last Ryder Cup participation.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit of crying, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy we've won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He passes the word to his fellow countryman Jon Rham who defeated the U.S. golf legend, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
“It’s impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining U.S. team members have fought for reaching the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
Tomorrow, we can put some fear in Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize ourselves and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I am proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat off the other team.
They were better."
