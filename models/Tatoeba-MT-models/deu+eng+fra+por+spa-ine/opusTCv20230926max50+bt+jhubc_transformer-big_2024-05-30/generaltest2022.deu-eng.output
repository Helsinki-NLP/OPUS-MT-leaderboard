The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a great customer, so it’s not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions which I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
I think this is very annoying, honestly.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones with moderation.
Let’s look at it, let’s help, let’s bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children, I don’t see any problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can best determine whether this is suitable for your kids.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep.
Purely legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps the psychologist’s statement comes.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that’s a risk you want to take, of course, is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire story, I don’t want to remember the title anywhere anymore, maybe somebody knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by pouring out food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapist, operates a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the site of the suicide and to document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist does some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that is suppressed in the brain an anxiety center and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window another is driving intentionally to death)
This faces fear in the book is referred to as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this story is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh yeah, I don't have the password for Wi-Fi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take long.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference returned?
Child, 4 years old, splitter under the thumbnail
The child, four years old, has wooden splitters under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
They tried to draw him with a pincet.
Very difficult to grab.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker along with sound capsule set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving levels are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders are fully automatically logged into a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read with matching headquarters.
Aid registers exist for centres that can only program the CVs of 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow the trigger of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogramme with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

Omikron: Johnson wants to boost booster
Always new omicron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccination offer.
London – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward in the corona refreshment vaccinations even faster than previously sought in the face of rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the two-vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency with the omikron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's boosters now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, thus rising to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a large increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am for everyone to introduce themselves to pronouns
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don’t want to kick off any official either.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of five books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an invisible shortage when sold.
How can such a padding damage occur after 9 months?
Just try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since about.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the latest books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and invoice it for me.
[CW] The feeling that I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) come in contact more often with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really appeals to me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we couldn’t help them.
I realize that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, perhaps it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of pulling the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, in some cases myself very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What Does The Series Suit "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the previously announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on the youngest John Patrick was relying.
Again nothing: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back at the cup loss at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October, said: "We have a bit of anger in our belly."
After the match, however, it did not lay down - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma should be mentioned: the three-part quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all of young John Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick said, “We just didn’t concentrate enough after winning Tenerife, and didn’t implement what we trained.”
To move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim said: "To win a horny game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," the lucky coach said.
"It felt like before 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
“The best gamemaker I’ve ever trained,” Gleim said.
While in Patrick’s team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after having already backed 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to hate.
Already on Wednesday (19 a.m.) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again for this reason.
We initially contacted a half year ago.
Always like peeling out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of rockers from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the move with the program "Good Morning, love luck" - if he can perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But this is nothing.
The planned concert was postponed in May 2022 - "on official order" to curb the coronavirus.
Other of his appearances planned in the Advent period must also first fall out, as it is called on the singer’s website, which will now be 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists are planning to pick up their deadlines already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed it as a young man.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra with fellow students.
Since then, the bariton has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has often been awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place - just like his hit album "For Women It's Not a Problem" (2013) - on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and labeled, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Morning, love luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the expropriation of large housing corporations, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, there is not a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party intends to set up an expert committee on how to handle the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the lighthouse coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a lease price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, “we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps,” the SPD politician emphasized.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornadoes have been drawn through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to be complained.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
In the evening of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States caused severe devastation, possibly causing up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a 320-kilometre-long snow of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado had risen, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw her showcase #NAME# sold out.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
Until when will you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, only can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artikle via the contact form or gave a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or was processed as I have not yet received BE confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertisements
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation from advertising slogans to calls for vaccination - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for corona vaccinations.

And that he didn’t feel good about you at the time, no matter.
He didn't think his job was good either.

Help with First Own Campaign
Boron to greet!
I’m currently running the Adventure Over the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign designed specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations written, the individual files invented and now I am about to write the entry adventure and I stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a fleet of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the next action should develop.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to uncover a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in a variety of ways: convincing, acting, threatening, detecting the danger early, whatever happens to players.
Group thickness: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with arches and saddles
If the goblins do not notice the hero in a hollow path and flank three arches to the left and right armed me the carriage, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schools, a half-elf.
The carriage is, of course, gone.
Should a defeat be inevitable, the same half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the help of the heroes in battle.
The carriage is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to get into adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon food.
EDIT: wow, I hadn’t expected so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m guaranteed to take into consideration many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I broke up the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can then bring the return tickets, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was stopped in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Despite the delayed start and the starting accident, the schedule was far behind planning, but you could still have shown the last ten minutes (planned) as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite this stupid, especially since Sky UK ended the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again ruling ignorance in the F1 with commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you could change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that Verstappen could change the tyres when there were corresponding radio speeches on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think such basic rules should simply be known when you comment on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle that is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally not liked with the Artificial commentary style of Roos, but admit that the taste is a matter.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL.
In addition, there are constant nonsense, which both simply make it look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (even unsuspectingly) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
It is precisely the latter that brings a lot of trouble into the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-off round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to come out immediately after the race without comment.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job except for advertising in the four races that they can still broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To this: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the stool).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal to supply an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is available in 3 variants from us.
At the end of the offer, look at the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, thus ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an air tube of 4/6 mm or so and it can already be started.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be attached outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level, you should put a back valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water runs backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we indicate the processing time here in eBay with 3 days, however, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is confused just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping sector... of course there is no Corona stop here.
Please do not rate equally badly, just because delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to rebuke about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?

Amazon Founder Bezo Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator to Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket system by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The departure and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under bright blue sky Bezos personally received the freshly laid astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the loop to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's missile system, and the 50-year-old television presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick Technologie.
How much you paid for your ticket, Blue Origin did not tell you.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his tasks and do everything himself.
She just flew with me, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flys up to 100 kilometers high
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the missile during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above Earth, temporarily with weightlessness before the reusable object landed again slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-out trip: the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I was also informed about career prospects before my studies, of course, but also thought at the time that I would definitely want to study and will be.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects oppressive.
On the one hand (study check, etc.) you always hear super job opportunities and the profession is totally sought-after, on the other hand you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That is why I would really be interested:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what education did you have?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your comments!
I am really uncertain at the moment and I am thinking of stopping my studies in 2022 and taking a training as a specialist in computer science.
If you have experience, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This issue came up with me last week.
Now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's only now a pole to it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress at us in the business.
It seems there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week was Mary’s Ascension, which is called “Ascension” in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So there was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
All e-mails that needed to get out before the start, order here order there, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "the next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very angry.
What is this self-sustaining for holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t give them ourselves properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simple: are we the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical style?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
“I love it,” said Catterfeld.
But until the thoughtful days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of the Mauser and feather re-formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird breeding is due exclusively to nutritional defects.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable spring clothing.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food needs to contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the lokomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare lokomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, also used with game tracks and defective parts see photos, function good, the German series E 95 is a heavy freight freight train electric motorcycle.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we worked up in operation
The German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tactile bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckerwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived World War II and later found themselves on the territory of later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn-Reparaturwerk Dessau, the workworthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When a growing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train services emerged with the progressive reelectricity of the central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger numbers were first preferably constructed.
Only when the E 94 was to be assumed that the processing number could not be increased further, the E 95 went to the point of view of the processing.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the railway plant Leipzig-Wahren.
They arrived in 1960 at the Railway Operations Plant Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematic with age was the complicated control of the locomotives.
Thus, it often happened that shooters remained stick during switching operations.
Then the man who was constantly driving on this locomotive with hammer and wooden wedge had to release the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of crashes at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to waive old locomotives and most splitter types, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
They added that the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only in one manner, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver’s stand, would have caused a problem in the operation of the train.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were terminated in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which resigned on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 has thus never been used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating system at the main railway station Halle.
It took some time before the leaders at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive began its initial external rework with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operative museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive is supervised museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Hall P Traditional Community have been working on the operational reworking of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to an exhibition at Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paint, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branched secondary routes, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig to become a central German network.
The main area of use was initially Silesia.
Hand-made model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks on the locomotive in self-work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare hand-made model, very small edition- perhaps the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage traces.
The F parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which unfortunately are defectively produced.
The middle beam does not fit into the provided mount.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be released?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Most importantly, they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #name#, do I want to explain the problem again?
Home fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, estimated damage has been incurred in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (county of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not start with a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
Fake news - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccine Photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech CEO U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccine.
The illness of a friend has prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he gets a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the "LinkedIn" network on Friday.
“For a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far he had refused to do so because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend from me is currently struggling for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask about the reasons.
“The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often driven by misinformation and distrust.”
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a priority in the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been removed for a long time - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times, according to appropriate data.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a relocation station.
After a fire with serious damage at a voltage station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg Circle in North Rhine-Westphalia have to end up without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire on Friday night turned out the lights of 41,000 inhabitants affected in several municipalities.
The Westnetz provider reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally completely fixed late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless deployment,” said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the western network mountors could initially only take some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system at the substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched to from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last ones affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 mounters from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
Authorities also called for neighborhood assistance after building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
“It’s important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or single people and inform the local fire apparatus houses when help is needed,” said Counsellor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the installation and operation of emergency power units for the residents of senior homes.
Furthermore, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been established in schools for those people who were unable to provide self-care or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are relying on medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
This is the blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can't mount the underframe on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send her back, because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would look forward to a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Can you send me the return letter by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
However, I did not reboot the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost impolite.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid were printed on the podium at the World Cup in Estonia.
The duo had to beat once again the outstanding Norwegian jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after skiing into the trail.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redesigned s and use version 4.5...
Maybe you’ve heard of problems many times.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be error reporting to Customer Service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in the meantime!
To make the color application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later not visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first strip on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the strip.
Slight overlapping of the layers of paint later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal shingles can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you decompose them.
Original looks are achieved by the decals or decals.
From signs of sovereignty on aircraft to ship names to ornamental strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or folded easier before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, pincets and toothpicks are time, patience and a quiet hand when sticking.
Cut out each decal you need individually and adjust it.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you moisturise their back briefly with water until the support paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then you only push a small piece of the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also wetted before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the support paper off on the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper so that it doesn’t stick to the finger, crack or even tear.
Suck out excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I stop reading the book and have to unsubscribe and sign up and load the book again and find the place to where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much!
I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money comes back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Child care in PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello all,
we were in child care for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly comes across.
In a row:
We had applied for the children's care in advance at the PKV and received the promise over 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet count with the PKV.
We once again applied for the costs of the PKV and received again 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the terms and conditions, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the promises that with one birth the further attempts expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed egg tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave your opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by e-mail and tell me how to get to them again?
All right, okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
You are happy to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now tell me that I have to send that thing back first.
I guess I can't make sure the commodity comes completely disturbed to me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment has been initiated and I have not yet received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise you can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible to purchase another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are promoted with additional stools to be purchased, but we unfortunately cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly a low-budget movie is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What is it that irritates you?
And what do you may not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With kind greetings
If there’s no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it’s not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes the waiting position... I will give up again soon because it just doesn’t work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high cost to the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, political expert Raphael Bossong said the EU could announce a "half-victory".
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) said.
Belarus doesn’t give up very little, but the EU feels like a winner – it probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It appears that there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakened cohesion in the Union.
“It seems that it can’t make itself stand if a Member State is going to do its thing,” as Poland currently does not allow access to the border even to the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policies at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border guard, border guard, border guard" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt at crossing the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, an official spokeswoman said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones in the incident near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be given medical care by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the leader in Minsk of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to news reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
Belarusian society is unlikely to have the security apparatus regularly running thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two breaks of rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is reported to have unlawfully overtaken.
A second objection was filed against the score at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes in the last round and had finished his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving ahead of him.
I'll check this.
I'll talk to the bank and contact you again
Thank you for the support

I won't both admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're not as serious as colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has put it all in place.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just crazy.
And with that you're a science enemy and don't take it any further seriously as colleague
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially planar-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without forgiveness and colour errors to the edge zone.
Lupes are often marked with enlargement data.
However, this information only applies to exactly defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to observe the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions on the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. even with impact loops – light reflexes arise.
Due to an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
With respect to optimal conditions of use - magnifying close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Sale of trees in Schönwolde: in the municipality of Krembz, women are choosing the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations when selling pine trees.
Once a man was supposed to have driven home without his partner because they couldn’t agree.
Every year he plants over 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many curious situations.
That makes the Christmas time always a bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise, will I be gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
I will also evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat, which is grilled on a rotating spear.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "turner", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fibre optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have trouble building a stable wifi network now.
Before I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer arrive the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less it arrives (that is to use a socket, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms located away from the other module).
This causes the Internet to be even slower on the first floor than before with the new fibre optic connection (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here too.
Could anyone explain to me why with fiber so much internet speed goes "lost" over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still lay LAN cable in the house.
I am really desperate, so I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro Account
Anyone who would have thought that they would be quiet with the Giro accounts for the first time now, looks fooled.
While many banks have used the autumn to be confirmed by their customers with all kinds of tricks, fee increases from the past also continue to decrease for negative interest rates.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just cut the free amount in half and even quartered for the day’s money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the group’s division Postbank – to 50,000 euros in cash and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer headquarters, which in first instance have even been entitled before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper instances also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions must be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their lives are like mountains and mountains.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who in 2021 re-enacted Friends and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance takes care of an entire army of assistants, stylists and coaches.
After all, says Aniston, get her one chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONLY chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly to her alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for great love.
And the baby desire was deleted from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt them.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurting.
Hopefully, success and fame will be happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula 1 went even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tape touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsports royal class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen’s greatest success was the winning of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob driver.
"I have figured it out once, I would have to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in the races in Winterberg in two days.
On Saturday he refused the attack by five hundredths of Johannes Lochner, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting somewhat and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he sat ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took a greater risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd win in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, finished second this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it like that," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won her third season win in the Zweierbob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the Monobob the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with leading Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
Besides her Olympic qualification, she scored the first podium this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I’m superhappy that Mariama takes me with.
I am super happy with the development.
There’s still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay,” said Burghardt, emphasizing: “It’s not just pushing, but there’s also a lot to do around it.”
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my basket and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn’t get it and therefore I couldn’t redeem why I finally asked.
Because of Corona, I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it was over, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
Only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one - or others like that...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - aside from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now on therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He’s also cooled and we’re currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid has just stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddle blanket and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
We also have homework, which we divide, of course.
Even cooking is a lot of work for me right now.
My PTSD disease is very well set right now, I am halfway well therapeutic and doing well.
Not good, but I'm doing it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is just demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven’t done anything yet and aftermorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place.
So my week goes like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Just until our birthday.
Only until the holiday starts.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual clues, because otherwise I'll pack that.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do that...
Are you doing the same?
Honestly, I am immensely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Very grateful, I can't say that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think that has partly to do with Mental Load of women, so I thought I could surely find suffering comrades here...
I definitely wish you another relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at school that many religion teachers didn’t believe in God and it’s just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it somehow.
What do you think?
You may also be able to talk about working and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
It also has a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?I like to write in English I also understand that well
It's been a long time, then I'd stop it.
It's okay, thank you.
I am expecting a feedback at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (24 years old).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two axes of time (or parallel worlds).
Firstly, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can’t describe it anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself I mean.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe the two soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Well, relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around, don't go in and watch more often, but don't watch for minutes.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is asleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it rise from the stomach?
Or is it right in the mattress with the face ahead?
You can find out if everything is okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was walking and there would be that you put the kids on your belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of you yesterday and no feedback so far.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To make it very clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It’s just that the policy of this broadcaster is now under the cock.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" internet station.
Arno: You want to be "not a running lift column."
What are you doing now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The ones, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who completely lacks empathy and attempts to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms.
How do you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call back because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heating applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and return dosed.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion is suitable for the following applications only as a heat support:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odor, stick or fire spots and dispose immediately if present.
Please take the inner pillow out of the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (refer to information from the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, shake the heat evenly in the pillow!
Then place the inner cushion in the reference.
In the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the indicated heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (maximum 43 °C) at your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverous diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced sensation of pain.
If you have any skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
Should seams have opened and loose cores have leaked, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the child’s temperature should be regularly monitored during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30° C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table basement.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach either.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed invasion under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought it again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop will no longer start despite the power supply.
Then I built the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 litres can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need in everyday items remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be sealed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stablely riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top beam, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from others, photo backpacks: in addition to the lid flap there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wander through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also daily items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus easily store both separately - and access it independently through the two lateral openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer case of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am in vain waiting for the email from your support.
#NAME# gave me an email yesterday confirming the commission of the

It works.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a bigger order, but after all I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year was unlike what I thought I couldn’t guess and just couldn’t redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.

The discs tuned in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
The aesthetic characteristics of our tinted discs emphasize the character of each car through its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright pieces of water on the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents opened, and salons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You’re not alone – the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneering colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to house your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge boards, you can develop your individual play style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will be locked!
This turns off half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players alternately carry out actions such as winning resources, moving carts, setting up tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awardee turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the prize-giver has moved five times, i.e. each location has covered up once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right now.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a well-seen guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heavy educational debate.
Former patients: eligible for education now raise serious accusations against him.
Please take care of you, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and others must never, never, never, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on eliminating test obligations for triple vaccines
At their next meeting, the Ministers of Health want to decide on a nationwide elimination of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
“We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and when the testing requirement can be eliminated for three times,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference on this issue as early as next Tuesday."
So I want to send the lamp back
What do I do best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page goes to the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be done about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning sense perception under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less rare to see pictures and most rare to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesar sections are surgeries that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the abnegation.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are accompanied by a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment by me describes awareness correctly, but had no u/Nitemarex **per definition.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 doesn’t help me either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also the standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take the defective chair back.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only delivered at the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Aren't I being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died Friday at the age of 97.
There’s still the new book on the table, fresh: “A old man gets older.”
The shaking diary of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, “I am already testifying to my life thanks.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria, over 10 million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
Production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected

Roulading Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a large pot.
What's going on now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it.
IE It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until now, the money hasn’t come to me.
Please check it out.
Where there are still Christmas frying in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas days such as the tree tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought a poultry yet?
Now the time is short.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller allows you to adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the noise level without changing anything on "gain" and distortion.
Further above it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a power reserve if it happens incredibly loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when you use a headphone or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you donate a VFS5 foot button in addition, you can also conveniently access the sounds on foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "take" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step in the future!
I had seen this in others.
Do you have a chance to return the lamp?
Because she hangs too low for over a dining table?
I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the box?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If not, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear agreement negotiations
According to Iran, progress has been made in the negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
“Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had continued after a brief week of interruption.
Negotiations will take place by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overcomes Saxony - Free state now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia is the only state in which the incidence of coronavirus on Sunday is above 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1,000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus were reported within one day and 16 more deaths related to an infection.
200 people who were severely affected by Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only in early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and submit it to the mail, that was it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill any more?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extistic.
We have come into a winter rigor and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What is the problem?
Yeah, what did it take place?
For the most part, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction, as some things have gone down here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been shown more and more that many of us here have a real bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who in recent days has become aware of this project and found a, simply, shear pile.
After some writing, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, where we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How do we look outward in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, that's why we end up having the discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cloud for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also oversized, so in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in time.
And I ask you to arrange it now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for pick-up - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Are there any instructions for assembly?
How long will I have to get them or choose to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She has lived vegetarian for a while, and nowadays she eats meat very rarely.
I was vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I’ve always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time, I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that it would ultimately support animal torture.
That’s why I decided to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that there was disgust on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and reduced animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Do not exempt your #PRS_ORG# from the statutory requirements for distance sales.
I am on the assigned date on which I do not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can’t be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately, that can’t be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
As of 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be constantly meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Defense Equipped for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euro Grant from Land
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfalz Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant notice of €45,000 for the new equipment wagon Water Rescue of the Volunteer Firefighter Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment cart is used by the diver staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice recovery as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is constantly anticipated that the rise in operations will increase: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to it.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I’m a bit excited because the whole action has already taken me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

Thank you for putting up the whole thing here, I also spent nearly a decade in a similar activity in the state service, say we were also weapons carriers in the executive, further I don’t want to go on!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and weapons wearers should attract people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally deal hard with the lived reality and it is of course also clear, because you of course have fewer people in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I don’t now mean to tell the excessive female female, because it’s it is even if you give them in this female.
But these marginal groups also represent even if it sounds funny to my experience for the first time a conservative stance, that is to say they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by excessive leftist politics, even if this policy is supposed to be for them or thinks it must be done right for them, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find that extreme right there, but that they may openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-dangerous plans is completely medially exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who were often in operation abroad often start to standardize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that some right-minded fellows also meet who have a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good so in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side too.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
It has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still ship the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep slices filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little time off), but I have been getting it more badly than right to keep my household clean and neat.
There are always phases where everything remains, and then and when it picks up me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never that “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses household simply for work and disgust.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more ordinary with your child?
But we haven’t worked on it yet and this question has been busy for me for a long time.
Because I don’t have any incentive for me, it just doesn’t bother me as long as no visit comes and for example, fresh clothes are always there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with your child or do you stay lazy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have completed an education in the field of software development and now have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting up again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an uncertain (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly speaking, I have no self-esteem and therefore am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a subjective level, but it’s very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I’ve been told more often that I’m acting uncompromisingly (which I think has become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth meeting but rather in addictive counselling or family assistance, for example.
But I don’t know if the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it, and it’s difficult to find something on the internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("even the simplest things again crapped") and I find it difficult for more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("I should now really know myself how to do this" / "I keep him with my stupid questions" / "I have to keep him from working".
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the spot.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up date
What do you mean to return?
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein absorbed with the feed (protein) the bird breaks down in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up from them its own protein materials, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather re-formation in the moulding bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curricular administration of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be reverted to daily vitamin supply.

1 g NEKTON bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (in) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the feather re-formation is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is reached until the pen re-formation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25° C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to notify you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in repudiation to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a fall application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that cutting fruit trees and hence walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a useless sofo.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I think, the only question is yes, if I can pay in euro and have my blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check this?
Press release: Serious traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alert currently reports to the police (14:03 a.m.), a car came into counter traffic when overtaking.
There are injured.
Oh, okay, I understand.
Well, thank you so much for it was so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is just crushing everything you can think of.
Before I go out here now .. briefly: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm doing the refer as a cross-entry.
Initially I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay anonymous at least a little, I don’t mention anything more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I landed at the magisterium and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job listings".
And it's only half a year around.
In the paintings before that I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swive.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I’ve had so little free time last month that I’ve been completely depleted.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there was my weekend my weekend and my evening my evening.
There I was free.
The stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
The family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also annoy me.
Basically, it’s fun and from the outside, the Ref also goes well when it comes to feedback and so on.
But I’m completely out of load and wondering how much stress my body endures before it closes completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have it this way for the rest of my work life - especially when I read some posts from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat bored, but was adequately paid for it and together in a team was what I had worked and not as a single fighter like me.
But then I wonder if I'm not back in the same place as now in a year and I'm dissatisfied.
You realize it's all somewhat messy, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely done and almost starting crying at the smallest thought.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me first.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the crying undertones of me.
I hope at least my situation has become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has evolved steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on genuine analog circuits, because they simply better understand the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only so burst.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound the way you've always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to satisfy newly added sound requirements, which has once again led to a boost in performance in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to help all guitarists find a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of playing dynamics and string stop, as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that above all, the end stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
Orlando Magic's defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner Brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable velcro closure parts, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror DSLR cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
Furthermore, you can store plenty of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photographic things.
Even drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano Eruption in La Palma: Perhaps the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic Island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, volcanoologists continued to dare not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the Island Council, state television channel RTVE.
Million damages
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, the more than 1,000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential houses and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast two new tongues of land, about 50 hectares, were created by cold lava.
The banana cultivation, which is of immense importance to the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcano eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, the newspaper El País wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the doorstep and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crisp tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "society agreement of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How the Christmas Child became from Nicholas
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifting.
Earlier, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. John’s Day.
The background of this custom still popular today is that St. Nicholas as Bishop of Myra secretly threw three women gold into their windows in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gifting emerged the custom popular in Germany of filling the boots especially of children with gifts.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as “saint worship.”
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the Christmas child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gifting shifted to Christmas Eve.
But since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as tightly, it annoys only the least that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a fixed part of the pre-Christmas time, similar to the Martinic usage with Martinssingen and Martinsszug.
Today you can find in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources demonstrate a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas’s Day.
With the Reformation, the day of gifting was postponed on Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, a joyful cuddle prevails over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christmas Child appears on Easter Eve or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities were assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white bart, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bart of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabulous creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, it brought a little fame to Father's Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that draw their sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussit wars, the Christmas child is responsible for the handover of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, a gunman was shot by police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly afterwards by officials.
Shots were shot and the man was shot.
He was declared dead on the scene of the crime.
The police did not start from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative luminaire harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The luminaire is easy to install and can be anchored in the ground with 2 soil spits.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Length of light max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that light up in their inner colours.
Very harmless, on the other hand, Smart Stone is: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern lighting object presents itself during the day.
Its organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He makes himself well also in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to maintain himself thanks to his size.
Great pre-work can be saved: As a solar light, Smart Stone does not require any supply lines or batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place that is raised by the sun on the day.
Two supplied soil spits provide a fixed grip if necessary.
The matt-white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar panel hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white and the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawn breaks, Smart Stone begins to illuminate automatically; in which colour, you determine it yourself: six attractive light colours are available for you – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charging level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins from the front the next day.
I’ve done this several times, it doesn’t work.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 has been substantially improved again.
A variablely adjustable PWM stroke frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super smooth operation, especially with bell anchor motors – the typical “brumming” is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function enables automatic measurement of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 Decoder delivers enough juice for older engines with up to 1.5A motor current.

Pills
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again because because of chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose.
My main problem is, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
During my last two-year break, I had got 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
As far as superficial, but it has burdened me quite a lot and I didn't feel comfortable.
Over the two years, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are perfume-free, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist didn’t take me so seriously and the cutaneous doctor’s appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
The lovely skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertarian severe neurodermatitis, then some rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and I have been hanging on sugar, milk and poor meat mixed food, because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally simply the worm is in it, but if you have such a construction site everywhere as I do, you also prefer not to go looking for anything else that is wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague Semina o.a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and I don’t know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and call the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone.
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But is it generally in great
since it is available in black large

On behalf of the people: lay judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge’s bench in everyday clothing.
But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they don’t wear a dress: creeping with professional judges determines whether and how long someone goes behind grids.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two out of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht at John F. Kennedy-Straße.

110 kV earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The government of Lower Bavaria’s planning decision opens the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The roughly seven kilometres long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the open line near the town of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part with us.

All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next process is?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a box made of glass and the entire sides are crashed, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken

No, it is in all books, that is why the inquiry to #PRS_ORG#, as it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have great problems currently planning my lessons in geography time efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as medium.
In addition, I can only copy s/w for free at school (which is annoying for earth-experts).
I just need a long time to plan my hours.
We are currently doing the topic of geofactors, for example, and with me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don’t want to spend too much time for simple lessons (which I need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (most often I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence also the worksheets.
Perhaps a teacher can help me work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I'd really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Trading is worried about Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains about declines in sales.
A possible solution is also ready.
The 2G regulations are destroying the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticized declines in sales in transactions with non-daily items.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 merchants, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many have already written down the Christmas business.
“What actually should be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without ground,” said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis revenue in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a sure matter, the chief executive said.
"2G doesn't bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he said.
The current regulations scared customers and required high staffing.
He called for the government’s approval of the grouping scheme.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked on 2G once (vaccinated or recovered) and had access to all shops with the volume received on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail – as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last without 2G were at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business,” CEO Wilhelm Wellner said in the Economic Week.
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the Center is trying to find solutions and obtain approval.
This includes the so-called bulk solution, in which "visitors, for example, at a central location in the center, can once give their 2G proof and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can uninterruptedly enter all shops".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame is also an error that has been tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to give back the mirror and have already packed it back in the package and glued it.
What do I need to do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The luminaire produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the movie set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in difficult-to-access locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lighting display.
The display displays the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the storage buttons is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current condition of the lamp when turned off, so that when new switches on, the known situation is back - Very convenient for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can resort to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester the same as built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper indicator, the right on the lower indicator).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connector for attachment, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of fixers on both sides.
It has been ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and therefore are also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, an tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is included in the package.
This allows you to safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
I'm sorry I got it and it's too small :(
"Party We Wanted to Throw": Frankfurt Celebrates After Turning Comeback Against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in series winless Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga finish.
But then the SGE turned up, in a good hour the frustration of a full season start from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN rejoiced, speaking a "package praise, to everybody who was there."
Initially, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters now in rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner said.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking at the outcome especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to have today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him, but is also well positioned with regard to the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have fit in December, that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go on step by step and stay modest" and "do the tasks until the change of year" at this level.
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, a game abroad at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o’clock, Sky) is on the schedule.
Grade I get the mail that my package returns to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately, it would mean that I will not order again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever seated on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarterfinals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany’s handball women sneaked with hung heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup headquarters, the DHB selection scored a defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to race against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow.
It was a bad game of all that we have to erase," Captain Emily Bölk said.
In the struggle to enter the semifinals against the 2019 World Cup seconds on Tuesday, a significant increase must be made to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German wheeler in a duel with three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backspace player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," rear-space player Xenia Smits admitted, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From the front to the back not in the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height with the pip.
Errors and technical flaws in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a rapid 0:4 retreat after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was reached by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter.
However, the hoped initial ignition was not.
Against the aggressive covering of the Danes, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in the scene - and if they did, they failed mostly at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
Thus, the game was running early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since rear-space player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard fault on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, she will be allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half the DHB selection came into play a little better and at least five goals until the break.
The only quiet hope of a retrieval hunt after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-developed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer make up for an increase in performance and left the floor as a clear loser.

I work as a vaccine physician in mobile vaccine teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon done to a large extent, part of it continues in vaccine centers for me afterwards.
I like to answer questions without time limits on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related to one (e.g., "I take drug X, this is compatible with vaccination.").
My responsibilities include information on vaccination, indicative position (person entitled to vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (I never happened).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have with us, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but they cannot (can?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television show "Wir in Bavaria" has been given heavy reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who has to “go fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated about the solution and thus probably caused amazement in many upper valleys.
“The Huidler,” the spectators learned, “is a cloth with which someone wipes the oven.”
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper-Paulic term, somehow derived from the more well-known word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably even for some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice at the road bike - really so crash-proof?
This morning I woke up full of urge, because I wanted to train at least a bit to prepare my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove my road bike that I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every downtown so (this time: thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splitters on the track.
Zack, loud swinging and my rear tyre didn’t want to take part in the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn back with half a bad mood and take the first best train home.
It was also not so bad in terms of launentechnology, perhaps it would be better if I practice this with the tyre change again before the bike tour.
Now I am facing a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance for several days ahead of me, I would be extremely disappointed to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I arrived to pick up the bike ripped 120km!) and he had already called them suboptimal because he was driving with them for many years.
But when I think I still have to change the tyres when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I talked to an older man on the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they were supposed to be unplattable.
Now, of course, it sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don’t want to spend 40€/tire now, just to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering: I'm currently on the road bike I think 25x622.
Though they also exist (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a road bike about other tires?
The Schwalbe page seems to me absolutely recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time for our SOLO series to get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprout and visually reminds the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable design foot directly to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather lower role but is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such a high sound pressure level almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high tone rise.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the bundling that is greatly increasing too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced, making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is knife sharp and surprisingly precise.
The suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that its same looks for.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to furnace the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer will again apply material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate location so that you can easily carry out the cable there later.
With the aid of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° shaft to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM obtain an interruption in the shaft, as shown in the picture "Detail shaft".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a planar surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto them.
The three stiffings should also be used and glued.
The stiffening itself can vary in material thickness if necessary, if you would like to resort, for example, to finished bars from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the foot plates, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflector tube, as well as the connection clamp on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a suitable circular saw or forest drill.
A round milling machine is then used to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the signage and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drills) of the connecting points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned from wood dust (sucking / blowing out), you start with the laying of the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflection opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unshort cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also allowed to hang loosely out there.
The frequency softener is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency softener, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document:
If the frequency softener is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely sealed.
Due to the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can let hot glue drop onto the opening and thus seal.
By the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed fast with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so the plus line (marked cable) must be attached to the plus pole of the speaker (bigger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people to the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people in the show, so we will follow the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
