Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting will also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
Obama’s deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the US Congress, some of which was considered an affront against Obama.
The speech was not reached with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly citative voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note screwed onto a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated in the letter, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the deadly emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police trapped him.
A day after the university shooting, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, saying he had any health issues.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, police later found Lamb's trace when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent’s home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running at the entrance.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar play for a few years.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40, living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer yearly market three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight commemoration on Tuesday evening, including teachers, staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the Memory Watch, while the university chorus sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no evidence that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers across the country, while 45,000 more were hired during Christmas in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary “Back in Time.”
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I’m a simulated bean and arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” said Spielberg, “undisputedly the biggest time travel film ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – at the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria as they have shown in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 surveys that show that Donald Trump is taken seriously
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it has (still) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit field, and some start seriously wondering what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
It is, of course, too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s endurance and are starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidature in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two in ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40%.
At the beginning of August it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent saying the same about Trump).
Next in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “mad up” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending toward Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first phone call state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to perform his job effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten bet their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates diffusely.
But a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is harvesting majority support.
He was 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would exceed the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just slightly more than half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly given their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change your mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as likely to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico “rapists,” immigration has been a pivotal point in public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump apparently will do so.
Frustration over the government climbs to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly angry.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The Five Most Exclusive Residential Districts in Germany
Here on the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
On the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"The offer of objects is limited to Sylt by nature," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student board in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top places of residence, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well-noted.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top in exceptional cases.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bavaria star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran's.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Pireus witch boiler.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their start-up in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller’s double pack (52/90.+2) and Götze’s goal (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally take the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th match in the Champions League for Bayern, Müller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who passed a World Champion’s shot thought to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium to 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept the word.
They showed a focused and dedicated idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home matches in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also struck here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, unbeaten in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but in their offensive efforts they often worked too unimaginably.
The attacks were too often initiated by relocation to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely went through against former Brownsweeter Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympic striker Ideye Brown beat the headball of the Pole from the line (26.
Then, by direct purchase, the goalkeeper Roberto betted with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria used to play her dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle bites.
But on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relying.
For example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latch (56.).
Before New Guardiola had a four chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng defending who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the squad, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave green light only after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer told Sky: "Whoever wants to make something else from it is already malignant."
Even at the first change Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another one on it by elf meters.
Before the game, there were riots at the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly mulled Bavaria fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the host Piraeus’ followers with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with punches.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth – this is suggested by a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is that with waiver, the risk decreases rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evidenced by a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are cavities and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of cavities.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smoking, first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham said.
It is necessary to convince people to become non-smoking, said study director Heiner Boeing at DIfE: “Smoking reduces lifetime.”
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research has already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter on Cologne’s Rhine bank with remains from late antiquity
For a repeated time, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists at the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological landmark care.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it was already known that there was a fortress at the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves has also been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman has been accidented at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the train station building coming at the end of the pavement and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries from it, according to the federal police.
She was taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
The investigating officials have no insight into the reason for the young woman's night-time track crossing.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or locals have heard acoustic perceptions.
Neighbors or passengers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information on the cause of the accident can be given at the 24/7 hotline of the Federal Police at 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to dilute the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
Consequently, the controversial private arbitration arrangements for disputes between corporations and states should be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said.
The Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically require the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should be equal in parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is also provided for the first time.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of objection to their judgments.
In the debate over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work for an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) required mainly by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe’s great resistance to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can claim damages for taxpayers, lift national laws, or enforce lower consumer and environmental standards.
In its initial opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
It was criticized above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission considers key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned not to restrict the possibilities of business lawsuits by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already exist at the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be no longer valid.
Delicious Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven’s lecture.
He tells about different places that he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minuscule and delicately arranged songs tell.
Where they originated and what it looks like, in their homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative fool.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, cleverly composed songs are released, which are harmoniously close to late-sixties American folk, but can drift into great opulent at any time.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") appears in 2005.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is missing from any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic shifts.
This sixth neat studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
Having escaped the smaller clubs a long time ago, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
Theatre he presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the significantly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear that the lecture is "more opulent" and you can thus throw away the "plate basically".
Only for an addition thanks Stevens modestly, acoustically plays few older songs, and eventually bows down under a roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut has been excited at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour
Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour and to engage with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six pre-determined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being checked by the media and the Labour MP closely.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a Shadow Cabinet member and after his speech at the TUC annual session on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour president’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has caught attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had "respectfully admitted silence" and recognized the "herohood of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour president to sing the national anthem, “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s leading team, calling for differences in economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are “stacked” within Labour, according to Corbyn’s comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and retirement minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to cut the limitation from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, since he has been Tory chief, over the dispatch box in parliament over the past decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has crowd-sourced ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s questioning hour is too confrontative, and that he is refrained from both “skill” and rebounding disputes and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of economics, will represent him if he does not participate – for example, when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the House spokesman, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to withdraw from politics in the style of a "casperle theater", often linked to the Prime Minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless teenagers trained to become photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn their livelihood.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose steadily after data showing a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most estimated since 2009 on the timing of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% leap after receiving the acquisition offer of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the Richemont luxury group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures outweigh all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said he had earned $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put his rating for the company on "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs for his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old Loppian, a hanfling with a good-looking fries.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Currently, Mr. Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation goes crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them are Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polyn has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Building: Here you live idol, whose posters have been hanging up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much as her mom Ewa earned in half a year.
If any.
She says, "Really, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
“I will fulfill her a dream.”
Compulsory school?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He's got out anyway.
For the advertising in the Superbowl’s advertising break, he bought three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the store table, Bieber also cash.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you’re amazed at the window window.
It is said that it has taken more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is expected to follow in November, doesn’t care about the many zeroes first.
At least he does that.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to Kartofeldöner-Idee
Potatoes or Döner?
Both can be done - in the Kartoffelfelder, which the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a shot.
A poster on a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner" that he had seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue spit has been spinning in his shop, filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to tell you how much meat and potatoes the spear contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches ground resilience campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resilience campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide shows.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling cheap South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA store deals and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snap about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers, from sales.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year, making revenues of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and grocery stores and in Metcash’s high fixed-cost quantities could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s sales in the food and food business to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction while at the same time pressing on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by fast-growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior, according to Australian tennis association president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight by Kyrgio's infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fierce qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen crushing a tennis racket after a crash defeated a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Healy's Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the single after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was slightly drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost in the US Open due to a cramp, but he is not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he is not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well at the US open, even in the fairly provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he’s being respected in the dressing room, he’s trained hard, he’s good in shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term solid part."
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick is very quick to achieve the ascent that people like Federer and Murray have pointed to. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the rampage, and I can think of him as the best man.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-man land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence stood for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and cried insults against the Hungarian police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks will have to take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would welcome another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special EU summit to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on soon action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions declared Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a spinning wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were employed in the race to build the spinning wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major congestion and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that the majority of incoming economic refugees are in search of a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection – a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the four-meter (13-foot) fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation arising from mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the military's deployment, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already invaded the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police detention and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a wagon with spindle wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process human data and pressed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's edge over Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins ground over her.
Clinton has now supported 47% of Democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their elections than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead for women and moderates, but these leads have decreased.
Their support for the men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is back here with only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has fled, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was two-digit ahead of Sanders, but Sanders now has a five-point ahead of that group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the pre-elections nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently don’t support Clinton—only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval to deal with the problems and the selection are also cited.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office in the scale, 57 percent of Democratic voters want to see him in the race – although one third believes he should not.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton increases ahead of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure fell by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the "most selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asking what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about election.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some important characteristics among their party’s voters in the pre-elections.
The majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion about him.
Democratic voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her term as Foreign Minister, most Democratic voters in the pre-elections are satisfied with her statement of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions about Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion about her had deteriorated.
It’s mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is regarded by her party’s voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters don’t think it’s an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of electors nationwide also view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good scores in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson stands close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson stands behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of voters’ support in the new poll, and others lose dramatic stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support rising from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted ahead of Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday’s survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson gets well among demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has broken off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen lower, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio ranked third with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey released last week shows that Carson is rising in polls - he lands at 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side cut for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Comfortable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimming holidaymakers to find still warm water.
A bath in the Northern or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather short pleasure.
Some people are no longer going to the sea: a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
In contrast, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a disgusting ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York’s Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members began hiding utensils and basically put the welfare of the brotherhood above that of Michael Deng,” police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with dull force to the head, trunk and thigh.
“Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family.
Brotherhoods and their members have to be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
“We don’t just want to blame the individuals involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this – officially or unofficially – we will also hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates.
An increase in interest rates will come, and the rise will fall, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will glide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history provides little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank’s representatives have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could notice that the whole excitement was possibly overwhelmed due to an increase in interest rates.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the “cheap money” era,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be stifled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on its way to interest rate increases, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll's chief investment rate at NuveAs.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
Extremely remarkable here is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed increases interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question “whether it’s different this time,” the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Fed interest rate hike all year round, and all eyes were aimed at this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing growth in GDP and set pre-recession heights in shadows very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
For bonds, returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring returns closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still cautious of expecting higher yields," Kathy Jones, Schwab's fixed-income analyst, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market as the Fed exacerbates its strategy.
Companies operating the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit from rising interest rates and getting local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse as a rise in the dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"The story shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet surpassed companies with a low balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher yields, even if experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly not distinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they were only imitating The Brits.
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC’s boss that the public-service radio station was “dumb” and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else – these are two spontaneous examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.
“And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and commission new works, I think it’s really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that hard work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less aware of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports Selection for kicking the commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as Judge - was produced "on special BBC way."
He added that he wants the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend fee payers’ money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs that online revenues stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Overall August expenditure showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers started making purchases with their cell phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that is hanging, and we may see growth decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rose around their computers to make their deals, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, slightly more than <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of all purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in downtown cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca killed in crane accident - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the giant Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mecca’s large mosque.
The mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the track to give their respect when the first of the dead made their last journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a building crane dropped through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents in the Great Mosque before the beginning of the annual Hadj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the crane’s arm when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management of foreign travel was prohibited.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, which plunged into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hadj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is carrying out larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British people are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
This leads to the opening of another 200 Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are laying down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work at their home.
If you can handle skillfully with a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Because British people are increasingly employing craftsmen to do homework jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now been outdated.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops for craftsmen and close 60 B&Q retail locations.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees prevail.
She said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move this further towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also rebuilt her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball deputy Aich/Dob were responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The accused did not confess guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was definitively exonerated of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the senior prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it emerged that the defendants used funds from association accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was dismissed by the Chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
As a result of the infidelity, the defense showed that the club had never suffered a wealth disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials had only paid compensation for their expenses and removed from their debts the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shilling (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"Then we were facing the situation: Do we continue to run the club or are we locking up?" said one of the accused, in the bread profession, large business auditors of the tax office.
He then decided with his colleague and co-accused to take on this task.
With all risks.
“We shot money in advance, put our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said at the collection.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
Furthermore, the payment of the expenditure compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
As a result, some of the expense compensation was only paid years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
For this reason, flat-rate and non-detail debits also appeared, the former obman explained the operations.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the payouts were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in detail in the financial settlement, only debt freeness was important, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an investigation into office abuse began against one official, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That was the backup, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
“Why?” asked the judge.
For a long time, the respondent knew no answer.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-accused was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage compensation".
Why would the judge and prosecutor want to find out?
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With this you're all out of the tailor."
“Am I a legal representative?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never received a penny of salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He charged the club for 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
The accused could not provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second accused had also received mileage.
All rectifications were made in cash, and he had to go from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main trial will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cancels another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the human resources reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the splitting of the company.
Hewlett-Packard (HP)’s employment cancellations have not ended.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company said Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in the past three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett-Packard share dropped 2.3 percent.
The company from Palo Alto, California, grew up with printers, is currently splitting: the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separately from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both shares will be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently reached the second-largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
As a result, the revenue dropped in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds to changes in the industry with a breakdown and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted late to increasing customers’ purchase of smartphones and tablets rather than conventional computers and doing more and more stores online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq would predominantly result in rejection: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed by 51 percent of respondents and 20 percent would be in favour.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day at 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair is on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days in the press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto “Mobility Connects” on Thursday.
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the Auto-Verband VDA are expecting about 900,000 visitors as two years ago.
Röszke: Violence outbreak at the Serbo-Hungary border
Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water launchers at the Serbian border against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had been formed behind it and a water throw was ready behind the police officers.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
Initially, the officials used pepper spray continuously.
Afterwards, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now retired a little while.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees came together and suffered from breathing shortages.
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of Decision on Interest Rates for the U.S. Bank
The world is watching the U.S. central bank gather in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that slightly more than half, which was still thinking last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks that the Fed will stay a bit longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She has warned markets to adjust for an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Excuse Letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted to "make it unsuccessful," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency phone number around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency office staff that police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before eventually taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was “no information, no evidence” for a “triangle relationship.”
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolute best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he doesn't go to jail."
When policemen picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the University’s website.
Stars who lost their lucky bearer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor is also allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All of this surely demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is refurbishing the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its company structure and evaluating the low-cost daughter Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute around 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team of Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120,000 employee-powered company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations after the court-stopped strike will be resumed on Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
The cockpit wants to achieve viable results "in a year with a predicted record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between trade unions and airlines has led to various strikes over the past few months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the savings concept "wings" is a background.
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource its own low-cost line to Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

The long-established Finnin in Göttingen has compiled a selection of titleless works for the White Hall of the House, which encourage her viewers to go on a mental journey.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester’s Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this caused the left-wing outside defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the appeal of an elf-meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say an eleven-meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw’s account read: “Thank you all for your messages. Words can’t describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I’m back stronger.”
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, “It’s a very serious injury.”
When a player leaves the pitch with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It’s never our players’ intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's getting very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in another direction, so it looked like it had touched it, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, “I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I'm so sorry about it.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will learn soon: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long before you know it almost out of mind.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fairytale of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on SuperCamps’ website, and continued: “Amusing, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we’ve missed so far.”
All nice and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the storyline of the book, instead reproduces a content statement of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree."
As if that were not suspicious enough: the text submitted by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins with: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win his dreams, the heart of Audrey, the girl."
Though he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the story of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the greedy, tree-falling, Thneed knitting once-ler, despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a hooking, sneezing tree,
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who didn’t read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Encountering Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but seeing the team England selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series loss is not on my map.
I wouldn’t rule out a victory away.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear any scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, it is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth separates from the England test team and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, Lyth's life would have been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopefully takes out more races for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn’t perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a beatman I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as the ones before him, but of course this depends on the crew position in the UAE.
The idea of beating Moeen next to Cook, which would give an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don’t see why a striker can’t beat there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he’s a devil’s guy of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made 300 runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's not a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made a few smart additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the niceest guys in the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful engagement into the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with the previously stated.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not being employed in the one-days, Root received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit stock (Brexit = Britain’s exit from the EU) could climb if the economy falls into a flaw by 2017
David Cameron’s unspoiled renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper in trouble with each day, even without the choice of genius Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely divided over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend said recently that some member states, as deeply entangled in different crises as the EU is now and not always on their own fault, are tired of Britain’s own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it doesn’t like them even if they are jeopardizing social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes a Britain looking out inside the EU tent - "Let's not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets you see through that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany’s cautiously wise Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exaggerated long endurance such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear one leg off to help the selfie brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even plan on deliberately unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "British Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU skeptics are the press baron’s oligarchy, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who made a name for himself as a "EU-Equal Bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing crooks, phone-hacking foreigners, and the non-National pseudonyms that own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than becoming his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum vertebrae, because Blair had put the principle on the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on my back on Monday in Westminster – I told him that he didn’t need to waste time for me anymore – seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch’s strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly express it - in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder fields of Tory’s Klein-Englishism can probably anyone say yes to it.
It’s what Hilary “A Benn but Not Bennite” Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father on television tried to be ill-loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs after all reports at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and above all in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for whom narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO – Tom Watson is steadfastly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to exit – foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government at power, which I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report from Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in her e-cigarette report.
PHE released the “basic report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the data’s resilience and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy foundation" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy.”
They said that the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were summoned to develop a multi-criterial decision analysis (MCDA) model to lead their opinions about the damage of different nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose managing directors were previously reported to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they would receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he is reported to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel will not be delivered, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco management.
The group's research "significantly acknowledges that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products at most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there's no evidence yet that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellness at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims have been responded earlier.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
Every second lifetime smoker dies from addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC Should Give Up EastEnders, Says Former Channel 4 Chief
Former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in harshly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time on Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissions or broadcasts programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee in his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place your production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, of course it’s nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what public television is supposed to be.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what Sky's former director, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-service niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't measure pretty much the audience, but they're fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their phantasma missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course, everyone thinks, we all think you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to “inform, train and entertain.”
He said only a little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example at public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in "informing, informing, and entertaining."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the proms, of which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with the commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have breeded worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction when they are irradiated with sound impulses that are too high to be heard for the human hearing.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic wave tissue can pass unhindered and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Trade Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint crushing legs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause tormenting pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest weapons fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to deploy weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
Related: DSEI Weapons Fair: Authoritarian regimes flow to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you travel with the DLR from September 15-18?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of weapons dealers will be driving with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6-pack of inbus keys claiming that “access to around a third of the bus stops advertising spaces on the planet.”
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists go to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works nonprofitly with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising of the gun fair - through a void of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, obscure corporate advertising, but "by blowing in with bright colors and animation it remains more adherent."
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not acted illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors deliver fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a US army order on "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battle head that delivers outstanding after-effects within the target."
Whatever this causes, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those whom I irritated - and the numerous, long-breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to talk: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly say Marmite doesn’t love or hate, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelids were burned and these fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Regarding this: Don’t remember to start a relationship at university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room bumble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a colleague is exhausted of sociability - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
As you start college at the peak of back-many, knocking on people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, so, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friendships.
Your roommates feel committed to talking and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to use themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my roommate who added a dishwasher to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they didn’t mind putting Drum & Bass a little quieter because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They reacted with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she let her own music flutter, closed her door and went to her three-hour examination.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student home?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing if you hold a roommate for your future spouse, catch up with her, break up again, and then see her every day, and perhaps witness how she moves across all of her common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make your abdomen a bit of reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the boundary between an ulc and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good joke is funny, but it takes only moments to become a bumerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding – but never spoil anyone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackle their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
Markus Gildner, a real estate company, is building townhouses in the middle of the Corner Valley for people who don’t have much money.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I'm showing how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly cheap housing can be created: he builds houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you place people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have properly implemented my project in terms of construction law.
Especially complicated is always the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the pitch regulation.
Scary.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there lack of space for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the locals respond to their project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely wrong.
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable homes?
Gildner: True, we have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I will show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, taping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installing because they receive an error message telling them that "software update failed".
To overcome the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will take you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely by slimming up the update, and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged while updating or near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a cancellation of the update.
iOS 9 release still on schedule despite WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9: the least exciting but best update of iOS 9 to date: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system
Before downloading, you should also make sure you have checked our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal wizard and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The second World Cup emphasized before launching into the crucial seven overseas races that "I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the deputy world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve seasonal races so far and also takes the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British man won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a bell of rain hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has included another member in its ranks, thus increasing the membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kissingen for treatment more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the supporter of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to accommodate chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" be seen as an expression of his connection to the spa city.
District office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonisstift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also attend courses.
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain to downtown.
Specifically at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new neighborhood office was recently opened.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, seniors and seekers of advice will now receive information on questions such as care insurance or health insurance benefits.
For years, we have found with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also, many cash payments are not rarely used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antoni pencil and the civil hospital as well as the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the salutis was taken onto the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment can be used.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new neighborhood office in downtown both directors see particularly demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
Furthermore, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office is also dedicated to the solitude of the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social meeting".
In this way, the social foundation makes a big contribution so that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The neighborhood office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the deadline for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, October 6 was now fixed as the deadline.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth-final of the Bavarian Football Toto Cup against the third-league FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally finished.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadion.
“We are happy that we know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning security,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of tickets now launched.
It is a special thing for our team to play against a third-league player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not for no reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won in 2010 with the district league 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-league downgrader SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died at 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Deanes of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the Artists House announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to establish the Treasury Chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and to transform the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking Punishment: Tim Wiese Throws Police Officer With Money
Former footballer Tim Wiese has noticed in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, was once a wrestler.
He wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years, according to his own statement.
Intellectually, he did not increase.
Wiese just cut his hair in downtown Bremen when he saw a car park guard outside issuing a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the fine due at her feet, as the Bild newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet aware of the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not the meadow will be displayed.
Panama authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the thriving of marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama’s authorities have teared out and burned the 4,500 plants.
Male beating 17-year-old Afghan
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: Three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster on Friday night at around 11:45.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and urged them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft tank station.
Three people were also on the site of the gas station.
One of these men screamed at the young man and struck him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nose breakdown and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed and calmingly talked to the bat, he initially gave up on his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there several times demonstratively.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racket and another male person.
The victim’s face and thighs were beaten with the help of a stroke stick.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was supposedly about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and reporters to contact them at the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller acquires Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also the pleasure of the velvet mayor Bernd Bormann, the economic sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and the mayor of Asendorf, Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at his side with half a position in the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopened the practice on 12 October, until then he invested 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and also wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was so, I just called her.”
The couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to meet and accompany families over the years.”
It is also an advantage to be your own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, two-time family father Frank Müller grew up, and his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor’s offices as well as hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and was appointed as Senior Emergency Physician in the District of Diepholz in 2009.
Starting September 19th, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family physician, his wife Ursel (internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle as house doctors.
"The endoscopy is coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the municipality of Velvet (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues," emphasizes Bernd Bormann, mayor of Velvet.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, approximately 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor's office.
A positive side effect of the practice adoption by Frank Müller: according to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s speaking hours continue to look mainly in familiar faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen.
A bit of pain has been felt after a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients still often," says the internist.
Her husband laughing adds, "We have a 6000-square-meter ground."
“I’ve always pushed myself for gardening before, now it could be different.”
The couple also have two grandchildren and like to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border checks are also being raised at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so “of course”.
The provision and security of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also intends to let incoming refugees travel to Austria and Germany and may also establish corridors for the refugees.
Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see this.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify border surveillance - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenia does not want to open up its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member has to fulfill his obligations, otherwise the system will not work,” said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already attempted to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to arrest them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been entering the Croatian Tovarnik ever since.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects to have around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media said on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was it to instruct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning with about 50 refugees, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had travelled through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary has shut down, so the police told us to drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could now actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan-route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a route somewhat further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and EU partners have since given the country a good testimony in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent last night at the Horgos border crossing which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday early at a local eye ceremony in Horgos: he considers debates on alternative refugee routes to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
At present, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers Advise Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are still mine fields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is reported to have heard from a cybercriminal ring accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information captured is supposed to have been done insider businesses in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, more than $100 million in total was earned.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately caught," the SEC said.
The trial of 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a busy operation.
People do their tasks, sometimes quick steps, sometimes comfortably wandering.
You head to the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Stop the city railways.
Pulsing, buzzing life at the magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I die I want to".
The ecumenical hospice aid with this action drew attention to its 20th anniversary and faces mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people with the action,” says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passengers for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passengers spontaneously attack the chalk and add the sentence about "confirm my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for a long time", others stand briefly, read, say sentences like "as far as I'm not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the margin about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is on the spot, too.
“Only if I realize that the end of this world is coming for me at some point, I can live responsibly,” says the director of the Deaconic Work Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicly effective action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to share themselves publicly on the boards, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and death is still full of taboos, according to Josefine Lammer’s experience, although precisely the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Facing personal experience with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by call, it immediately contacted and was there at the time of its foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers – 43 women and two men – accompanied by the affected person and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences experienced.
“I see life from another wait, I think it is precious, and I appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables training and further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx Mixed Results, Reduced Financial Prospects for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook to a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company is planning to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company will “yield solid income when considering the weakest economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zack Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its unit Express Shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating earnings were basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit saw higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: Maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start off the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows that it’s growing solid, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed representatives worry about increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – even by just a quarter percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they’re observing,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertains the financial market.
About half of economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait from the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the impact by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time,” he said.
If she does, she "must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expects an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world crashed at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell below its peak in May by more than 16 percent, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below the high of May.
For Fed representatives, market turmoil influences the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks, they would pull the lines at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Central Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there's almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary agency.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint by then-director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc's Global Asset Management Strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, advocating for an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited noticeable impacts on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability aspects first only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate increase because markets are getting upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should rush ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
It is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a single point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C is likely to have it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, including individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who support selfless asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a body and soul teacher.
Even with her 74 lenses she still loves to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seekers’ home on Dillinger Straße.
Here she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is quite different than in a proper school.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction application for the €2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gym building at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously endorsed without much discussion.
Earlier, the panel had decided, among other things, on an application for a construction “exception” or “exemption” from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "satellite roof with non-middle first and roof overlay" is to be erected.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "Through this we get a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained in the meeting.
The "release" again was about the roof inclination, which for energy reasons - unlike prescribed in the construction plan - should be less than ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "release" was therefore necessary because the construction plan relating to the roof inclination does not allow "exceptions" - the Bernried municipal council generally acts more restrictively on applications for releases.
However, the construction of a gym is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this," Steigenberger said.
The gym building at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of the process, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land Council Office for examination.
Clinic Peissenberg moves to Schongau
The Peissenberg hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned – namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peissenberg to Schongau.
This is predicted by the surprising plans of Krankenhaus GmbH of the district, which Land Councilwoman Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms are present.
Employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a workplace in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice closer to the hospital.
When asked who should succeed, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who agreed to take over as of 1 October and switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this in any case means an "upgrade" and an expansion of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine", Jochner-Weiß said.
Fischer is a specialist in heart pacemaker and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the Innere Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to run both houses, are expected to close the former hospital of the boyhood, which still has 35 beds, in Peissenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is complete.
Country councilwoman Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Council, opposed rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Society, is to be used in the future as an accommodation for asylum weavers.
"I exclude this." As the property continues, Jochner-Wiß could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," Fischer said about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which had been welcomed by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by colleagues from Schongau to assume the position of the Medical Director.
The Peissenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past few decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are required tonight (20.15 a.m.) at the Bergische HC.
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners had a painful defeat at the BHC and had something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the opening on a corn field near Pratau (district Wittenberg), several hunters were in operation, police said.
A 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals.
What exactly happened to the accident was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, prosecutors and police said Wednesday.
Suspected is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who admitted to the crime and led the investigators to the place where the body was found.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not return home the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim’s personal items.
During interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspected crime came out against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detainee admitted in police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was scheduled to be presented to the prison judge on Wednesday, and the investigators charge him with killing.
Insight into the circumstances of the crime is expected to bring further investigation.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggle on the German housing market has long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This results from a study on behalf of the association "Social Housing Building".
For comparison, 260,000 units will be finished in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then encounter the housing market and go into the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also presents significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing forward a housing deficit that grows from year to year.
Currently around 770,000 housing units are missing in the urban areas, says Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntary longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaws on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing Building" proposes a restart.
New incentives will boost social housing.
Thus, land purchase tax could be waived and the property tax for housing supported could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The funding program for refugee housing of the Staatsbank KfW is already well reached by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been obtained on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Refugees have free travel: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no way through, as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia intends to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbo-Hungary border, hundreds of refugees have departed to Croatia to reach West Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, Croatian television station RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, it is women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
They were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police had seized the first refugees on the Serbian border to neighbouring Croatia.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine cleaners are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the close of the border, few more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before closing the goal on Monday, it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage to the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern border city of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicts are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees.
However, practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
Hungarians say Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum seekers will be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
Workers started cleaning up in Röszke.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in the past few weeks.
Barrier grids were removed and one of the reception warehouses in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this transformation.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees have reached Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government reports.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the order of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
“We were busy cleaning up after Sunday’s bridge festival when suddenly ten people were standing with suitcases at the entrance of the tent,” said Wernstein’s mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was closed for it in Wernstein,” said Stadler, who immediately offered his aid and chauffed the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to near Passau.
Before that, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with jars and drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefighters.
“We were very pleased,” Stadler said.
The trapped train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been discontinued.
The regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in course.
The Brückenfest on Sunday joined together with the Bavarian neighbors, the day before a two-bridge race athletic - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately to build structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has highly officially and publicly brought the stance of the Hungarian government into the dust circle of National Socialism.
Sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in border areas.
Even the refugees will have to find that the "promised land" that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a huge challenge, in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create decent states for protectors.
And there will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-resistant neighborhoods
Konrad has all his hands to do with refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the Traiskirchen Initial Recovery Centre has already taken control of Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he reported on his first success.
The hosting of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday also took place without much turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organizational “master performance”.
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisial situation.”
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in the current year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks – 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already had discussions with the state leaders.
They would have assured him that he would still create neighborhoods for the upcoming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's doing well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
We also hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be that quarters must comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, “emergency standards” should apply.
As opposed to the Ministry of the Interior, that he was more successful in accommodation, Konrad justified his experience.
I am an elderly master whom you can’t easily tell the untruth in your face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the republic, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Its own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparent problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for refugee accommodation.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the affected persons can currently be accommodated without these measures, said Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of emergency, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city leader criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed"
In a prolonged telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of the state, Josef Pühringer (VP), on Monday coordinated the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees from the other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is for Pühringer “a logical consequence” of the Germans’ action.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
Four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building have been moved into the S&T, the remaining (2,700 square meters) is to be leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
“In IT, smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies at the New Shipyard and later acquire some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Federation (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2700 square meters of space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the Arcade
Furla handbags are at the centre of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project quickly in the Pigeon Market Arcade: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around women’s handbags of the Furla brand, purses are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Before that, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also inspired by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the larger area of Linz to sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, whose own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put widely in the cradle by her mother.
I am most fit when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get in delight when seeing a beautiful handbag, the professional woman can’t answer with the last certainty.
Perhaps it’s because a nice pocket upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump’s Pfalz ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called enchants.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, attacks journalists or reveals gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the U.S. Presidential Office is strongly pushing the campaign.
And cut it out well.
This is also recorded in the Paleopolis, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the Winery Village on the Wine Road.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants place is over a dozen corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Falkland: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel, the town hall, made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadt style either," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadter has shot a fun documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would surely succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to be the opinion that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its surroundings is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to high German: the Enger, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the guardians.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first purchase of land in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: their desire to return home for the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He didn’t receive Trump because he once fled without permission, Roland Paul, director of the Institute of Paleohistory and Folklore, declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal emigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes sharp statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken reluctantly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Like the poltert, that’s not as sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so awesome."
Does he think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
Pension owner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family gave something for the church angel during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine this from Donald,” the 68-year-old says.
She would find it better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who at the time of his grandfather were in the US had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Sarah Bühler, winemaker's daughter.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will mature even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 movie followers, and interest is arising in the US as well.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 mountaineering villages.
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountaineering village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators, as Sunrise scored on average 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase from the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached an average of 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349.000 spectators at 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning men more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters' star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 am to 6:00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, 720,000 full.
Average hot seat is 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident Nine that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that failed to overwhelm McGuire’s show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly seen who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor, was wrapped in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows on the day before three of two become, you may accidentally have given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically forgotten why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, “If not you, who should get Wood’s last rose?”, their answers could become the game loser who won the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood’s best partner, except for himself.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it’s so fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said last week’s home visit made it clear to her that Wood could be “the One.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game – I am now unreservedly set on him,” she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a gerangel as did the Aussie Rugby League convert on his first point return Tuesday in the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punch return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show her true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Specialty Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his bad catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne feeds on a point restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first game district
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble cursing and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian wheelbase with gun force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, seized his oil company Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
Free voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis in Bavaria’s schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse,” said Aiwanger.
“Otherwise, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system.”
The Landtag Fraction of the Free Voters will meet in the Under-Frankish Commune until Friday.
In fact, there were quite other main topics.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
“Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the clause,” Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
“That’s not how it goes, we have to address the causes,” the Free Voters chief said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
For this reason, Aiwanger also requested more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticized the fact that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern leaves, others don't."
“We need to be more capable of action.”
But state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot trial "middle-level plus" at 47 high schools, in which a prolongation of the gymnasial mid-level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it takes nine years again to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free drive at the G9 wherever desired.

Four people killed after police fired rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber shots at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they resorted to rubber shots.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, known to be able to kill, but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesies say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who wanted their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on track since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Center Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Center.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
We are waiting for the corresponding offers, the city says.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Consequently, no contracts have been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought a portion of the property on the Ringstraße / Corner Große Straße already a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
The investor presented plans for the project for the first time.
Several interested parties are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational shelter
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, debated, and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Building", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
This was originally on the non-public agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the System-Building Management to the offensive: "We have not yet got an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it’s good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project costing between 10 and 12 million euros has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions among sea buddha owners who had come to the meeting sparked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Seabuden owner and member of the board of directors at the interest representation of the applicants, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant piece that surpasses all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the facility: "There must come whole bus loads for this to be expected," Schulz said.
However, what exactly happens on the area of a hectare of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First, we must have a coherent concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, construction plans are still variable.
Twin offspring at gorillas at the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have children with its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body so far.
At first, the “Picture” reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of evolving into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overcrowded the European nations as they flee from ripped and impoverished countries of war.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and anxiety,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelf would be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many have also fled the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric hose formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained roughly equal to 29 in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% resolved diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, compared to this, diabetes completely dissolved at only one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in general were better in the "surgical" group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastrorectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and more likely recorded complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).

In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent an obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think that once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have tightly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult.”
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly considered in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unpretentious in school times, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and this falls in love with her.
This is the same in the recently published novel "Really We Are Not So" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel may be interesting especially for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Borealer and the surrounding towns.
The principal author grew up in Boreder and is delighted that she was able to lay a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not adequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to how genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terror attack, pointing out that the US’s violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children’s use of hand disinfectants in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant revenues in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Kids are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room,” Lopez said.
He said that some children willingly drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courageous social media trial.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whisky stand, but people leave this hand disinfectant within reach of children, and if children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scenting hand disinfectant at school, was brought to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate child hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl fell through alcohol and kicked her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, on CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfecting cloths and store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York state planned to poison their "common" teachers by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the ruined plan as a "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a car accident on the crossing between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-band towards roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two vehicles had stopped ahead of the roundabout.
Subsequently, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident were damaged by matters of about 10,000 euros, police say.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be slipped off.
Rumor Kitchen: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson accusation and Warburton will be cautious in January new obligations that could destroy the unit of the squad
Dons Raise Leadership over Celtic to Five Points
ADAM Rooney's elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a brief victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the dons create a five-point gap between them and Celtic.
Griffiths Downloads Talks About Disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they are no longer showing highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There is a lot of excitement in the old-company games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
Following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10 Aberdeen men, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points of lead.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
To be together now is so important.
Warburton carefully on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had filed for some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox squad.
Brentford’s former chief said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, talking with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been struggling with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later lifted - the third red card of Collum, which was withdrawn in eight months.
Neilson stays with what he said, and insists, "I haven't questioned integrity, I haven't commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The unreparable hibee was reproved after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's sure to say I won't go back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board trusts Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board of directors still have confidence in the management team to turn things around, but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’re going to get the guys back to the trab,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which gave them a five-point lead from Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven-meter in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything in cup games or leagues that haven’t won this kind of games either.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK’s of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland dropped to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the process
As the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were the officials able to take the disturbers in custody.
An atemalcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old man had 2.15 dollars and first remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witness to an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made by his best friend for the first time in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I started to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macaber lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story how he wants it, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he can remove me from his Witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die in an unnecessary death.
Man after damp police persecution persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the deserted and swampy waters, just a few meters away from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called for a home breach incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trench to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in their stalls last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming they were carrying out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media he’s always tried to do what’s best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt copper sample at Lidaris that he can’t explain.
He had retained himself for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to look like "too-high-hanging grapes."
“I planned not to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and sleeping well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Earlier, Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — whom I will name when asked — and offered him a job in my stalls to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stalls,” Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraudster.
If that’s the case, they should certainly stick to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Does the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Are I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and dismiss me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led to him saying he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "laughful" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, contrary to the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
Yesterday it could have been the whole day, as it was.
It was also the same on the race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all understand that we need rules, but here we’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
Police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was admitted to Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia appeared to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver escape and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Refuses Rivals for Claims
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players’ tackling as “agenda setting” by two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model example" of the rugby league and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the fight.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle, saying that in tackling, they were focused only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches to his team was confident in him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That's happening again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about fighting when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed our defensive system or techniques all year round, but over the past six weeks we’ve made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that’s what made the trend shift for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening to ours on Friday evening and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it’s the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug accusation
A man who is possibly in danger of life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men who were arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly life sentence for attempting to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire quantity and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 deposit together as security to achieve his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden,” Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he would issue his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily and stick to an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 in Karlsruhe: driver’s cabin breaks apart
In an accident with three trucks on Highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cabin was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked for over six hours until 2 o'clock.
Damage incurred in the amount of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she fell asleep, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of unfair pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through, found the confusing news and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address, and discovered "relevant" web research that used terms for searching for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would “lead to pedophiles on the Internet” and then “pretend to be a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he is addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty, in the sense of the indictment, to have taken inappropriate pictures of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the requirements on January 25th of this year, and not appeared in court for a hearing on March 24th of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the sexual offenders' register, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings of other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
smugglers flee on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people increasingly at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest.
It was on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the federal police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been seized in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and congestion.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
Munich Central Railway Station reports showed that there were significantly more refugees at the railway station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Alone, by 8:00 a.m., about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said this morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday, 1759.
Stuttgart: Tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest is expected
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the land, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the footstep of the tropic storm "Henry", which in recent days pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning there will be bursts of 60 to 90 km per hour in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district.
On Friday we can see the sun again.
The crowd makes it: every two years, the car manufacturers at the IAA showcase their innovations.
In 2015, the movement is mainly recorded in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular in demand: about 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment alone in August, according to the Automobile Federal Office (KBA).
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be present with the dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel expects to enter below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as a five-door vehicle.
The second variant will be followed by the combi in the spring, which is already visible at the IAA.
And what’s going on next to the Astra on the IAA with new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door vehicle in a conventional and highly sporty GT version.
It comes to trade early next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: Very new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan outlet wants to find its position in the highly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer, however, is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who will celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque according to the manufacturer is 170 newton meters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is launched in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 that can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën selector placed mainly hand at the front: the radiator grill was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was primarily modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court gave right to a former prisoner of the Tegel prison, who had been housed for months in a too small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the persons concerned may hope for money even if they were imprisoned in too narrow rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner succeeded with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on free foot again, was moved to a larger cell.
His liability lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity injured.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons from the period in question, only a few days of imprisonment were relevant for compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, there would be “fear of a ruin of the legal protection of the personality.”
The court now has to clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
It was not until April that they gave a prisoner damages because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multi-occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humanity.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 of inhuman housing.
The plaintiff at the time was housed for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a cell similar to the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness is increasing, even fighting is supposed to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of youth, 19 are expected to be dropped in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: “We’re doing this”
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is happening to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to welcome a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we will do it."
The following overview gives you what is going on in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually – for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially for affordable rental properties: annually 60,000 to 80000 social housing falls out of the rental price limitation, and for these particularly cheap housing will also apply for refugees.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to one billion euros.
From the perspective of the Pestel Institute, this is too little: 80,000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Building agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While previously there was a job ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the requirement of residence, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the lack of skilled workforce, the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly has been pushed for the majority.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
So far, there is not a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
Thus, in Thränhardt’s view, the establishment of networks is the Königsweg for work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that few refugee parents are giving their children to the kids, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate administration in Berlin.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handheets in different languages.
Should the demand for female educators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities – for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In countries, students without German skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his stance.
Refugees wishing to study could be facilitated access to university.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum-Seekers Benefits Act when they begin their studies.
The latter generally do not get a bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of bafög eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, as of 1 January 2016, this range has been reduced to 15 months.
However, this financing gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear points of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to live here, in Germany, lost," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested that the basic law should be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue of society than it is today.
This will also have to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism becomes more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general gender equality law for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and non-white German stakeholders have long demanded and what international agreements like the Anti-Racism Convention Germany require must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says physician president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"When it comes to man-power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money must be invested in the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand over health cards immediately upon registration.
Benefits provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum-Seekers’ Benefits Act.
Otherwise, doctors create language barriers above all.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are being informed about their diseases worse than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s offices, would interpreter costs need to be covered, she demands.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and the youth are about HIV education.
However, with some other illnesses, German doctors would be clear from their education, Montgomery thinks.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the lack of doctors, the refugees may even be relieved in sight.
The Syrians have a sophisticated education system, and many refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rates and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe terrifyingness, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, employees or physicians who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misconceptions, Munz says.
Manege invites to dream
With the new stage "Passion", the Circus Probst resorts to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressing and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream about the maneges on the brick.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current manegen stage.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegencocktail with world-city flair", so Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip and articulation.
Balance with a single wheel on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in all respects.
“The animals belong to our family,” stresses Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconduct in the care of circus animals is only too often a topic in various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: “If our animals are not well, we are not well either.”
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each batch unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly called, are read out from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel good, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
The highest commandment is to take good care of the animals.
Specifically on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zebrastit, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a box for eight years and nothing has happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” Brigitte Probst says.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is sure,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our hearts.”
The Circus Probst invites to its performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11:00 and 16:00.
Thursday is Family Day, for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also obscured by the claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr. Mugabe’s speech with Buhrufen.
Last month they broke him out and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to disrupt Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title ‘Death’,” he told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in parliament ends, and as soon as they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "worried" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cut leads to a charge of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and will be focused on delivering previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses, the company said in a statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical plants and whose Palo Alto garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it wasn’t until September and if his rehabilitation goes on as planned, there’s no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old boost during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, it has been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "unbeatable" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show Giving Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicidal rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more likely for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Man’s Year, with the aim of questioning culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediateness of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, enjoyable and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much more profound effect on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really cannot buy luck.
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often withhold themselves from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone care employee explained to me, “My listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the little moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, which brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of occasions before finally raised their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only seeking to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which managed to hold a 2:2 draw on its own on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested why when he ran in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he finished nicely in the long corner of the network past Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone believed PSG would make a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed with Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was ranked up a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But besides a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp’s posts in the 34th minute, they offered little to attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up itself, with some mispasses and poor deadlines, not least by Ibrahimovic, who patted in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and was then given up after Cavani rebooted him.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill in bringing his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a shoot, who was guided by Wiland at the pole in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had picked up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was awarded a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat off in front of Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of his huge debt repayment plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to repay its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
Early Wednesday morning, Glencore’s stock price earned a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange.
The share jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the broader plans to repay about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other raw material prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the municipality of Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will repeat President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to tackle areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before going to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberspionage and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car rented and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill his dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
Then on the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
With a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream and once you borrow and drive a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
The same was done by a 29-year-old from the Gotha district.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell into the slide on wet roadway and drove into the steering board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented the move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain’s Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times cup winners, four times Champions League winners, twice club world champions, twice European champions, one time world champions - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 EM before leaving Barcelona.
“I was told that Barça wanted to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything at the time, we nothing,” he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change.
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM.”
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bavaria’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the lawn, turned off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and eventually celebrated the Royal Class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night by HBO’s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s chosen script.
“If we’re talking about diversity, then you’re doing it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow, okay," as the actor's comments on The Martian got firmer.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about – whoever the director will be – how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a bitch beaten by her white cowboy.
The producer of Dear White People voted for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's directing rights; Damon replied that their directing "could in the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against coloured colors.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned or had more than $10,000 for life,” Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can’t even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time will get it,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, he receives the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment for it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received mass of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was to be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, now the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers were reduced to their spoiler role, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a Houston Astros game half for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how it comes,” said Tiger’s manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) scored 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end strongly this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to get very focused into the game.
The designated tiger hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He has swinged the wood well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good at the (stroke training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs behind the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Wall, the only man he faced, before designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who took a two-run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finish run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th leading in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the 5-4.
The right-handed, however, stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an unmoving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month due to a back pain.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I would make some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff battery in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez achieved his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers scored a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“It was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by relief right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger’s RHP Anibal Sanchez exited due to a throwing shoulder injury.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder rupture, is expected to be activated for launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a twist in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived there should then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the town of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It estimated 450 to 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls in the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government presidium responsible for the initial admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options of action cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European countries of "collective sighting."
Four years ago it was pleasant that the cup of a military involvement with Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is landing crashing at our doorstep," he told Deutsche Radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to the refugees on the ground.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on Austrian television station ORF that no one will be returned to Hungary.
Nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s so agreed,” she explained.
Asked about an agreement whereby Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks about this between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had arrived in Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
On Sunday, Germany began temporary border checks.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis.
The EU's interior ministers are planning to take a new start at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) on the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
Given the strong refugee sending in Germany, the Federal Federation aims to support the countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Confederation will manage this jointly with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery Office in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those who need protection would also get it.
Those who have no prospect of staying can’t stay in Germany either.
This view was sharply shared in the round.
The Chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole must now cope with a "enormous effort of strength".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent tractors from seeking evasive routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Spacecraft "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This is what researchers conclude from observations from the spacecraft "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon slightly dims on its path around the ring planet.
This diving movement is small, but still too large for a permanently solid celestial body, Cornell University in Ithaca (New York) said Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that under the ice sheet of Enceladus there must be liquid water.
In 2006, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturn moon, which spit water vapour and ice particles, feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the southern pole there must be an underground sea, astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the length of the hidden ocean was unclear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must waive Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation found an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association announced.
Rama had complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Löwen, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break".
“It hurts us hard, Rama is a terrible loss.”
"Of course we have to think now," Sports Director Necat Aygün told Bild newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unified professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously already contracted with the VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the possibility of proving its ability".
Goalhunter Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shock next week.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to start running.
Okotie was injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a heavy collision.
Contrary to first fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos Contain Lots of Sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line, he is often more despised by them.
Mangos contain relatively much sugar – especially sucrose.
Still, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When purchasing, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.
The shell color alone doesn’t say anything about how ripe the fruit is – so green mangoes can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then they naturally taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango also gives a special note to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The U.S. package service UPS will re-establish up to 95,000 aids for the U.S. Christmas business.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being sought.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 aids.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Dryer Tower, then distinctive cold front
In the coming night, the valleys of the northern side of the hairdryer will break through, as Meteo Switzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night the hairdryer blows partly with storm force through the wooden valleys.
After the end of Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rainfall, winds and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the northern side of the Alps the hairdryer breaks through the valleys at night on Wednesday.
Subsequently, the hair dryer blows through Thursday morning in the dry valleys with bursts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnland partly also with more than 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can penetrate in places to the adjacent middle country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the southern slope of the Alps begins to swell.
The rain will last until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps has to be expected to have partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hairdryer gets out of the air, and a cold front with strong, partly cloudy rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decrease significantly.
The following days present autumn in the north at 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer in the weekend at up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the Working Community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in secret.
With the square it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustine monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at the time as a corrupt babel for sins.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the pardon trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colourful colors and fantasy shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have arisen that devote themselves to topics such as cross path, plagues, commandments or our Father.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who dealt with the respective Bible verses on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice as much a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"There the education has already happened with the tube stick," remembers Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work on this, perhaps to bear myself with Mr. Father again.”
His second aim is to give art more emphasis in a fast-paced time: "The perception of worlds of imagery is today characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is displaced.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this respect I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost on Tuesday, at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation, confessed to "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old did not take care to fully comprehend the Bible, but chose the topics important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text simply explains."
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s images speak for Möhler both the (Biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition opening on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX railway
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth hills modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX railway was over again.
Failures in politics and administration caused distress, especially among locals who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
The approval will come in October, the first councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce to the Children’s and Youth Committee.
“I hope that this year something visible will happen,” she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without "more memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sends a clear signal this weekend.
Football responds to the increasing situation in Germany and assures politics to help with the upcoming problems.
“I think this is our country’s biggest challenge since reunification.”
“In principle, no one can say that doesn’t matter to me, I have nothing to do with it.”
“It has to be of interest to everyone to take care of this issue,” DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and I meet Minister of State Mrs. Özo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and want to help.
The decisive steps must be set by politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“With the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this program continues until 2019,” said Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some Bundesliga players also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will wear the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler told Bild-Zeitung (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
“The refugee drama affects everyone, no one should look away.”
“We federal football leagues can, no, we have to use our radiation, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a “famous sign of the league.”
For the EM qualifying game against Hungary this Friday, the women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a major community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing companies have started their own projects in their places is great.
Equally great is that small and small clubs are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we spent is lived in football.
“It’s of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will each provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already obtained the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand after midnight, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he was fainting, then he pulled himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is “fully working” at the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday's edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
“I’m full of SAP, full of my job.”
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott said.
McDermott usually pendulated between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen."
“It’s important to get up again when you’ve fallen.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible for the night race in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later for the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus vs. Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all the hopes of a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken up.
The national player will also be missing from the Bundesliga football leader in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./Sky).
"We cannot resort to him unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
Given the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribe eleven in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football instructor praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will likely play the second game as well.
Co-player Reus’s research statement that the final entrance for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl believes it is comprehensible: “Marco is not so wrong with this.”
“I think we have a good chance to take the title.”
Robot cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the IAA auto fair about a "new mobility age".
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic jams, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport’s strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a swift transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to be "not charged with additional liability risks", the federal government intends to "verify the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum allowable speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The federal government also wants to promote a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles on public roads are to be expected “far after 2020.”
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site is estimated by the authors of the study at around €8.4 billion for 2025.
“Digital networking of the car can lead to greater road safety and efficiency,” said SPD transport policyman Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of drivers’ personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical – much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute presented on Wednesday on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent.
However, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the ride on all roads.
On the highway, 15 per cent of traffic could be imagined in flowing traffic, 45 per cent in traffic jams.
More than one in four would not be left to the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
The Dusseldorfer wants to start the title fights from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision is to be made at the latest on 22 September.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The boys learned it in the morning.”
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," German coach Jörg Rosskopf said during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
“Timo was also missing at that time, and we became European champions.”
“We should focus on that,” the World Ranking Fifth said.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis of the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a rail break.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax-figure cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: showcase dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and thus putting men in skirts.
“I can no longer say today that I am the terrible child of Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
"Before, it was bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which can be seen from September 18 in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed his initial rejection attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was opposed, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Canada’s Montreal and Paris Station.
“It’s so much more than just beautiful dresses,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibitions give an insight into the hardly overlookable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: for example, a stylist was specifically hired to fry the dolls.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tonnes of material have been transported to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special taste: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“Women are smarter than men”) and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, earnestly fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll wouldn’t have been allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t afford the models.
They didn’t get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
Earlier, it was about the long embroidery machines in and around plauding about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in large quantities for customers, who reprocessed them, for example, to blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashion Spitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which relies on past styles, forms an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Lace and Embroidery.
Only you can bear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken down.
Private specialty stores and also wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching customers in this way.
Nowadays, the bulk goods are being produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively through chains.
Moreover, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
There are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stick Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerable."
Reinhardt adds: "This also relates to the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg office of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think primarily economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places the machine embroiders small balls.
Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with the traditional Plauen tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memory piece.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plans a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney still dares to create a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", it is not about a re-film, but a kind of sequel, which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family during the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday to a group commissioned to steer the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving strategies for start-up business,” he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Fostering new start-ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax border control policies, promote state enterprises (SOE), raise private capital, and revise the resident reporting system.
Following the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legally governed business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the limit of mercury in prey fishing
The European Commission intends to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish, giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: “Risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies are being spread to pregnant women and toddlers with full force,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic policy reasons" should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large prey fish are already so heavily exposed to mercury that on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
According to Foodwatch, in return for this easing, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a “trick” because smaller friedfish, such as carps, are usually so lowly loaded that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction of small fish is therefore “a perfide distraction maneuver that alone helps the economy,” Wolfschmidt said.
Mercury is a highly human-toxic heavy metal that is heavily enriched throughout the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government warns that “already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children”.
However, the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the existing maximum levels that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment primarily through coal combustion.
According to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal power plants release more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently exceeded and extensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
