The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastries
The new CSSD councillors in the capital will appear to have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the municipal council to understand their renewed SDG companions.
The period Aktuálně.cz "examined" members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I am rather a novice in Prague politics," he said during the "college" terminology exam of Culture Councillor Lukáš Kaucký.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
Perhaps you know the concept of golf hole.
"It's possibly the only expression of all you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, I don't usually employ slang."
From the glossary, the definitions of which the newspaper Aktuálně.cz published last June before the SDG voting congress, the draft selected six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to pastry", "bull neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and one fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for the education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get involved in these things and I don’t want to appreciate how civic Democrats have fun.”
“What matters to me is how we will behave in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have realized that the previous title is an expression of an influential entrepreneur and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucký; the only term he hit in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But rather I know it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councillor of Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both socio-Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastries".
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; soon Plachý is revealed that it is the headquarters of Janoušek companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge obtained them from the news, but he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-Democrats.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really seems like we don’t have anything like that.”
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we do word games with names," says the president of Prague's ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose partymates call Hulda.
“In school I was called Bříza, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that too,” says his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the elections deceptions during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igráček" ("playmobile") by some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský doesn’t like being called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Fucks" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit torture of "witches," he published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually older, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who “return” witches are sent to an isolated area, so they don’t harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer this if not."
“Healthy young women are also not isolated, because they help in work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa, Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure.”
He issued an informative brochure that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” warns Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim it was due to a miserable cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman burned herself in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It burned on when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease witch hunting, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt for witches that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forced men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a portion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects which, in addition, caused them bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about 1,000 detainees.
The tenant of Bakala: heated with coal stoves and signed a higher rental
The elderly and old man crossed the doors of RPG Byty’s customer service center of the “coal magnate” Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he had some documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
All three have just seen the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-room apartment with second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes an ademan.
“Everybody says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory for testing liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine o’clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Lease 2011", can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a small paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly gives you time to read "157" and the number already appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly marriage comes to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve regular problems, such as formerly: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG floors around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been working for a week, so it’s starting,” they answer, after briefly doubting the workers found in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old Bakala mine floors are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they are continuously appearing in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"I didn't even change my damn bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction unhungers.
According to the workers, at the moment retirees come more than anything to check if they get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as the special RPG offer promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the February rental discount.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people,” she estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
“It’s not a threat, it’s information about the only possible way of proceeding and fully in accordance with the law,” RPG warns on its pages.
“You’re not going to judge anyone here,” says one of RPG employees Byty and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
“The current rentals still don’t even cover the amounts necessary to maintain the community fund,” recalled Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, adding that the neglected state of the community fund that annoys tenants is, for owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in rents in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights red.
"The rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month per square meter," the screen said.
It only increased the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio by 38%.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
At 2,600 flats, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not impact rents suddenly, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the hike of the rent (see the chart) back in the floors, mainly in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to attend her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous well-known buildings in Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardroom.
About 90 people work at the company, mainly in the baby boom age, and they wanted to allow architects and delineators to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers as part of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of their children.
The mini-guardery was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a staffing of more than 2.8 million Czech krones) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding (two years) runs out, the company Arch.Design has an obligation to maintain the mini-garden with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted for a year and the submission of the application for funding contributed to the company Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present throughout the day for their care. The nursery currently hosts children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guardy", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of daycare is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use daycare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-guardery program are comparable to the usual preschool program.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up late children from school when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the tile and mosaic fragments, a façade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent softly curved lines, all are typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with onic lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought-out order is observed.
At night, the entire façade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the torsion of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, railings, door ornaments, mirrors and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
Architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their project plans arose ornaments for the representative apartment of the property owner and the mosaics used in the façade.
On the façade workers also other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and Gaudí’s Güell Park, where other parts of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the worms."
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction rules of the moment at all and was not allowed to be influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so shocked by the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the town hall requested, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The six-storey house is completely traversed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way smoothly, without giving up the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and dashlights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on every floor of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and the hallway, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose the mattress and somier: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First and foremost, they must be perfectly complemented so that they can be adapted to the specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and gender of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and summer are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that is not usually heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aerated and, above, are on a firm foundation, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very tall mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who returned from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their shattered shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive poor information from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in cushioned furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not round like after a tough match.
Simply, he sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also acts as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple norm for calculating the width: when lying up your face, you should have your hands comfortably shrinked towards the elbows," counsels engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu čalouníků to dekoratéř, who has been dealing with the healthy sleep problem and ergonomics of the furniture for many years.
In double rooms, each needs its own sommer and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to matching the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sockets at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that fits the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully quilted bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe poorly and can not wash their shell, which is done today often.
And since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress lifetime of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
Everything has a but.
That’s why sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and washing machine size!), their handling on the larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can look like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a suede, do you have a firm board?
Never!
As much for beds designed for one night visits.
However, you should do (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet sockets containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although a socket with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulable sheet sockets should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special attachment of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "roll" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structured or tabled sockets with the so-called multi-torsion cushioning.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also note that even if you use the proper mattress and summer, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullida"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder brace or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example, castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made solely of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Vasíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "cooled" with breeze vegetable extracts, so the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
Favorites right now?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic allow you to make mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where your head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as healthcare means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and sommers.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Consequently, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
For the time being, the device is the approximate size of a light box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell each other that it’s not about spying, but another way to decrease the chances of a tragedy occurring,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I acknowledge that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone’s bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled.”
“Earlier, parents trusted mobile phones enormously, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is controversial whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will virtually always check whether the child carries any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is spreading, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be done with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have an inclination meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and remains immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says Čech.
In their opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a lightbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being carried out on devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a certain time, which can save the police time," he adds.
Even though tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechs to surround all of the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to fire explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive mesh from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of mecha per year for training manoeuvres.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that in such cases, such manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exempted either Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of mecha.
Such a length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or specials) sufficient stocks for the 225 mentioned above.
The soldiers of the Quick Response Brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even money-based shooting practices are limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can also not understand that such amounts of mecha are repeatedly purchased from us."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll undoubtedly know why they’re acting like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy,” admits Jan Děcký, commercial director of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha, also saying he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the mesh only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticism of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these trials are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, it got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's 244 kilometer order," said spokesman Pejšek of the Defense Ministry's shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of mesh from the police pyrotechnics, who eliminate the ammunition from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life ends.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mesh can be obtained.
The Ministry is already experiencing clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will arise with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Businessman of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved traveling.
Abroad he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit he bought a half-ruined house composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“At present, the value for money ratio of the accommodation in our area has pushed me to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he has gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," the entrepreneur said last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped greatly by winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ competition,” says Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity in Liberec as well as in the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
It certainly recommends to everyone who wants to try some company to participate in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and they’re proud to be involved in something that gained overall recognition.”
“It’s not, much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
"It is only my name that appears on the front floor," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissolved by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner’s hard work, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued their efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in fighting the competition,” said the winner.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žďárský’s father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during Communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the unspecialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only our customers started to consider the Farmet brand considerably better, but also foreign partners started to appreciate the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year maybe it wasn’t just a sample of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also received recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, prompted companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“Obviously, neither do we get rid of such a situation.”
"Revenues decreased by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was on research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs,” says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an excerpt from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an excerpt from the trade register when it checks the insured's taxes," said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the Absurdity Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms part of the Hospodářské noviny business tournament for the fourth time and begins to create hobby among the general public as well.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, it almost reached 4,000 this year.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in the number of papers needed for tax returns we are at the world’s first place,” says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business standards has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czechia is in position 74a, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated each year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The organizer of the contest then selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey more than a hundred were presented, in particular 105 meaningless rules and regulations.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
This year’s list of seventy proposals is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually blocks entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations are not left in burrow water.
In 2007, what disturbed people most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating zone, the intention to go with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation, which ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
The third is the defeat.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
This year, the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it had eliminated the obligation to have a fridge.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s Vodafone Enterprise Main Competition 2010, companies were presented for whom commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities vary completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, the persons with disabilities, in others the personal or health problems of the employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, as they make up more than 70% of the employees; that is why it was awarded the title of responsible company for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Companies of the year competition finished third in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it first purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities have the least possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
Enlogit’s IT company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona grant in trouble, which is specifically helping the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
The laundry company Praní to Čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact on their pension funds, are also well placed.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesia region.
In the category of Company Responsible of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed forms that were not completed or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Companies Responsible of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the Vodafone Companies of the Year contest."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the Companies of the Year’s Main Competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a precise interested party.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for this.
"For the time being, I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and bidding," said Právo, Chief Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelena, adding that for the time being, she can't disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, only one can speculate.
Lubomira Černá, a spokeswoman for the Agricultural Fund, responded to Právo’s questions saying that police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
“It’s a client, not one of our workers,” he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and takes place when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
“Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer,” the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who would be submitted to the invitation and, since he is at the same time an interested person because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the site where a large road to the Borská pole industrial zone should be built.
Afterwards, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns a month.
Since January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
Accordingly, families will have to take out of the portfolio, starting in January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas roughly 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaic, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately increased, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore higher consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are growing across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price rise is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay for central heating about 50 crowns more a month since January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns more a year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Pragueans will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague can rise considerably, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in Ústí nad Labem around 2,500 flats, will increase rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to court those who disagree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase by up to 10% next year.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in fashion, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in health care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hunger are no longer an exception.
This derives from the experience of physicians encountering such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk.”
“Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages,” says Pravo, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to catch a bottle from their father's locker, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Wodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and doesn’t smell so much,” he explains.
This is confirmed by Motol University Hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirits that they took at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, it is 13 and 14-year-olds who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to go in perhaps four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought with 3.5 alcohol in the blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," said the department's doctor.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts note that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak properly of dependence.
“Alcoholic is a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it’s rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year forty drunk children were hospitalized at the Motol Paediatric Clinic until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and should stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirits, there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention for Pelikán: Witch Day, New Year's Day and the end of school.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“On the Witch Day I came to see up to seven drunk children at a time in admissions,” Pelikan adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hunger at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
"These do it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and don't hurt at all."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikan, adding that patients often lose good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a serious patient room cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I’ve often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the kids directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people so that you would earn enough to pay that night,” Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft found in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that such a device has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was so far used by the Czech army and was still in the state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the one-seat L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, instead, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seat planes, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a total of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary two-seat L-159 devices.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS pledged that the aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and will serve for pilot practices from NATO countries."
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework,” says Pejšek.
The Hospodářské noviny newspaper published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not convene a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired from Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already reported to the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the latter is expected to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than annular are subject to a lower risk of suffering from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple proof of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Thus, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger pointer of the right hand shorter than the annular finger.
They had the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was snow-covered on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the snow-mounted machines circulated throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning, road D5 was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the road D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústřední automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed at mile 91, two commercial vehicles collided at mile 93 causing injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the grove.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at Kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
There two trucks crashed.
The drivers should slowly travel after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and embed into kilometer 182 at Kývalce.
There, several kilometers of traffic jams have been formed.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 °C.
Traps are forming, for example, in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run delayed, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At 8 a.m., another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně airport was closed from eleven o’clock on Wednesday evening until five o’clock in the morning.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to the traffic in Vyškovska, snow tongues are being formed in Brněnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To dump them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to tell when they will open to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads of the region that, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In Czechia, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually rebound in Czechia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is employing a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the encoded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" to its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains actually causes it to function like a small pomegranate.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies that hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when you cast your murderous metal scratch rain, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise sighting point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and presses the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters minus,” Audette said.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer industry giant announced Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July the following year from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees from the consortium, who were previously spread across the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office at Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Furthermore, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday provoked joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of the economics section, Markus Frank (CDU), claimed that it has won a “Global Player.”
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu is settled in the city, the settlement is a great momentum for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The administration previously informed the city of its intention.
“We have naturally offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the property owner at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
In the end, economic motives caused the fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The previously used property by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial construction project for the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticism regarding the mass building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and as regards the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and appraisal firms, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then Siemens joined the company of computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has the most businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats Against Assange
The distress is becoming more and more seized by Wikileaks.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
Wikileaks’ disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for a homeland of the Internet in Europe.
The well-known American senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations reported via the messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services web to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: “Perfectly, we will spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, CNN said in a call to Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate’s security council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“It had desired Amazon to take these steps before, before previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
“The illegal, monstrous and disregarded process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s list of sought-after people.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why it is feared for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the responsible for WikiLeaks revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a counselor to government chief Stephen Harper said, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute is growing.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had called for the Secretary of State’s resignation, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in spying tasks.
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms” that are necessary in the light of the leakage of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
“We have done our utmost to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna freezers are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future freezers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The ice cream and the ice cream.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
The ice cream takes the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future freezers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships at the house’s own ice cream shop.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national and mostly southern top house: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the development seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the faucet of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made with natural elements alone or without stalizing?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises you to avoid the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar bean rubber, guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to glue flavored ingredients into their goods."
"However, they must ever experiment."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better doesn’t necessarily depend on whether you have more toffee aroma or more fruit purée.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and somewhat less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is an arthymetic problem: Peach puree with lots of sugar is used, the sugar proportion of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano brings out an utensil with which to fix the amount of sugar from the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the utensils for the automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also an utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is batted simultaneously and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of all, all the automation is left out as far as the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrolled mini-premier.
“In all courses,” says teacher Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time for something like this to happen.”
Inspectors in a Complicated Situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert are also hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a senior Efsa manager was without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which made the General Office of the Environment as well as a clear-seeing parliamentary member of the EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, is used as long as they are of high technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry, and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that GMO plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
Current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not searched, how are they going to find them?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this field, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has got some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to knock down a large piece of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was made debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smells the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with antique stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be disgrace, they would grind the gravel or they would send it to the garbage," she says in her office, a wooden house that once was a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the shooting company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the shooting down.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram massif cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in hopes of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and over it.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He climbs his off-road, takes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures throughout Germany.
He says he is the largest ancient stone trader in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sliced sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Dawn limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It notes a lot: Red sandstone, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Beautiful travertin."
Anciently the massives belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, toba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple apparatus and a carriage, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone treeman to make, in addition to quarries, a sculptor, a ironworker, a glassworker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes care of the remains.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent fighting around great potentials
There is an active inflow in the buffet.
16 students gather around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students in mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In some kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission is to hire the most talented students at universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t facilitate publications on their students’ skills, exceptional talents are attempted in practical projects and captured.
On the second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is earned to the talents.
A lady from the staff department delivers ballpoint pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
She explains to enthusiastic young talents the internship programs and jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, look closer at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
“The main point previously was in technical projects,” says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified labor force.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 vacancies of engineers.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this engineering gap will grow further.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the crème de la crème from many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta talent hunter, the notes give results.
"So far we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are near their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized businesses, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staffer for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the next generation.
Currently there are 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or do their thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child care or good chances of ascent.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the employee’s preconditions.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification for her aspiring candidates to work.
“I think the applicant is especially attached to the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called internal Employer Branding, also corporate identity promotion within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then promotion is achieved directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus undisputedly annulled its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drills remain sealed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drills in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters thus wanted to diminish U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
It has not yet been clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroler consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tighter controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which has been charged with corruption charges, has fallen into discredit.
Obama has announced that the profitable tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulations to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by advisory firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's mining ban.
American Energy Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged soon, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is crude oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil spills have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems good.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures journalists: “Today enough oil will be passed before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys roaming in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
There are no brown spots of oil floating on the surface.
Before, she grabbed shrimp at handfuls, Esther Badom explains on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland through a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will draw some filled oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark liquor sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hung their palms.
In vain they are looking for bands of birds, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier of the outside is quiet, it expands a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with the smell of a gas station.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says, hurricane, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant health hazard."
There is a war comparison.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a fierce battlefield for years: here more than 60 years ago the first European explorers broke out, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place its first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is forbidden: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred metres steel platforms protruded like rare water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most exhibit total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been dumped in 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the failure of the vessel "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the biggest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaked pipelines as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defects rates are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drills, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally diesel exits.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "We bring 34,000 nairas", about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which scammed the pipeline network through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this stage at least 16 million liters of oil a day are lost throughout the Niger delta.
Only an insignificant portion of the temporary raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and senior military officers, hold the best portion in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robbery, no illegal refineries.”
While the Ogoni conditions are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely broken our country into pieces,” Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security issue.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckyer than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities saw a major safety issue on some A380 engines thanks to their investigations, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic failure in the engine.”
This affected Rolls-Royce engines belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on November 4, in Singapore.
The Australian airline has launched lawsuits against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court of Sydney that enabled more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said its airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on land.
Lufthansa repurposed the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada nationwide causes traffic chaos
Fully white Germany: From day to day it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets, chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter icy Germany: Almost all over the country reached icy temperatures during Thursday night, which has triggered traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowshoes are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind spans sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Maritime and Hydrographic Federal Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for moving it.
There many trucks and cars were trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street disorders.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created jams.
In Thuringia, snowfalls affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on lanes or broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia, an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers trapped at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered mild injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to the snowy streets: also here a truck was struck at a crossroads because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after a car struck near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: the snow will be increasingly softer and dust-like and will thus roll in mild cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank seeks buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently settled its headquarters: twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the refurbishment, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns its company headquarters again after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements for it.
Energy reforms reached approximately €200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of newspaper towers renamed “Greentowers” at around €500 million.
If the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of misfortune, but did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunshine at Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
Keep silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved half-stab in front of government buildings in the country.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand government president John Key told participants of the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Alongside the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the memorial.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the Gore fit in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the genre's boundaries with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip off their enemies from their bodies alive when in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying hilly landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple groups of targets, it is a shame that they cannot rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the trilogy about the drug dealer's hairstyle "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or some less brutality from the artistic house.
A brain mass and bowels that sprout cannot deter most fans of art cinema.
Most of the action fans die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and stays stuck for an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and sits back there.
It's a pity that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody façade, hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, it’s all an atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
And that’s why there’s no escape for spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images and the dark soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eye hero, whose motives are never explained, at any time becomes a warrior coming out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new signs of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this until controls are allowed.
At midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea’s help in the bucket, hidden in a valley leaving the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby El-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique only serves for purposes other than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or inside.
It was not long since the reactor was running, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is barely more known than at the time, the puzzles became older over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but he barely saw any indication that there was “a nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible."
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior U.N. diplomat responded in the summer lapidarily that the IAEA has “sufficient material to have questions.”
The Syrians very quickly rid themselves of the rubble of the alleged “unused military building” and ravaged the ground to consciousness.
In June 2008, however, a IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial sellers at the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not come to the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always stated that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium was derived from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at the Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "is gradually turning into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the IAEA non-proliferation treaty is pending.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not yet made public what teams are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, once again derived from the vicinity of the towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to all three locations in the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
By means of satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates bank.
A Western diplomat with a senior office in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is no “indication of sensitive activities,” neither of uranium enrichment nor of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the trucks vanished from the ground, no one has information about where the rubble remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, unlikely to be recognized by the Syrians in 1998 for its capacity as a radioactive waste zone.
Recently, Robert Kelly, former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three alleged suspicious locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be by chance, but it hardly helps to dissipate suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, allowed by the Syrians, to keep possible military secret, only the deployment shows the extent of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, which is why the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, hides the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option I am open to in the future,” but it is still hesitant.
This path is very risky: it takes the majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not precisely anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected, "What if they do not find anything in the end?"
Love in the times of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her debut still unnamed.
She has herself written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian War.
Bosnian women’s associations have rapidly protested, with the latter moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He is not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on this gives victims enough on the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, granted after a strip and released a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Their content remains inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer."
It’s sure that Jolie’s movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Currently they can reach peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream with joy as the music resonates loudly, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in Southern Cork, because players throw themselves, and find, ping-pong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this weird drinking game and the discreet computer don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy is trying to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what the future will hold on to him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's far from home and I still have no job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shooter she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, perhaps it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, economics experts and the Dublin Social Research Institute ESRI predict.
Until 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to the one that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-trained Irish, for whom until now everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, complaining that "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes away and loses our country and thereby an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a shady future appear because the government is only dedicated to assemblies and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
“They cut the minimum wages, but they have no strategies to find new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
Observe how your colleagues go from unrecounted practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those starting to work, doing abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,” says the manager.
Photos of a boy surfing in Australia and a boy snowboarding in Canada are on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known how it is to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they are building a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, we are going to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his home only a few times because he works overtime to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," she says, since she was a long time ago from the first time she stepped the threshold of her home.
“I make money in Germany for a home in Ireland, where I’m never so good.”
He laughs somewhat embarrassing and goes through icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
“They were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed and I am young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he hears often nowadays.
“No one should be hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
“After seven years came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand go well?
But these days there’s one thing that worries him greatly: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only not too many emotions,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of attitude changes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in their country, the same number as last year, but considerably higher than 25% recorded in 2001 (graph 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45% their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in conditions of poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and that it has declined again this year to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see graph 5).
Around 31 per cent say that, whether they or a close relative, have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has declined since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Trash
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, the situation was far worse than feared by the foreigners who were trying to help the country go back after their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations were opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed around the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the cancellation of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking UN official in Haiti, said it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community affirmed, with caution, that "we do not think that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The draw is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic devastates the country and more than one million of the earthquake survivors still live in stores, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors consider choosing a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become apparent, Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving forward from pointers to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, it will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some disagreeing members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions where one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will offer the president even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the trade unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adjust official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modify these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentinean agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that’s why Mrs Fernández is giving signs that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the grouped creditor governments at the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" in developing a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanliness of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, considering that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have declined.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, quietly, many of your husband’s policies.
Half hurra for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of whom are eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a comprehensive assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a proponent of sentiments for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but almost.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been inclined for total independence from Taiwan, obtained virtually 50% of all votes versus 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD matched the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large clusters with banners and girls in light clothes dancing.
Nor did the mysterious attempt at murder of rigor fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man straight in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been determined whether the man intended to hurt Lien or revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan typically enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Accordingly, the KMT often avoids advertising its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiments against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China was confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the shelter.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would definitely like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he openly urged explicit independence.
However, under Mrs. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been gratifyingly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to prove that he can also have relationships with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to establish an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that the negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hastily approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better unemployed if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present himself to the presidential elections.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also take a consciousness test.
Mr. Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be due primarily to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
The PPD’s large samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already crossed.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives you some thought, but it respects the Grammys rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly represented a big breakthrough and, considering his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, which have latestly been concentrated in this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans striking and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is considerably inclined towards merger as in Stanley Clarke's, John McLaughlin's, and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk earned a deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the Billy Childs Ensemble's big camera jazz and the ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Direction for Classical Albums
The classical music nominations for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mixture of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for five-movement piano and orchestra, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations for classical music are distributed into thirteen categories encompassing orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The category of classic producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Orchestra Concertgebouw; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra of Nashville; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and the Synergy Vocals;
In the BBC opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Orchester and the Mariinsky.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play in Avi Avital Mandolina, who performed the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains approval from the ordering committee
The Temecula mosque project has obtained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and jams.
However, members of the committee decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews and Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“Only they speak very loud.”
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded in favor or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Lady Libertad dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the Zero Zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been smoothly living together for years in Riverside County, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the draft to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it very peculiar, although it’s little left to be a really ‘alien’ way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday’s online edition of the publication Science.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets from Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated large speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Monkey Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, so to speak, appeals to biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead poses the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth ages, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times,” Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team, said.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, officials said.
Two of the dogs recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met Wednesday late in the evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They're back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t mean anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the virtually two-month tour the couple makes participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer kid, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the "prearmed" plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the demands of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to revive under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently unifying the loan, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankrupt business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design desk as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep balanced their gift budget
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant pitch in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic bead-adorned jumping strings, or approximately 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s technology toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are teddy toys the size of a pig that sing a note when their belly are tightened.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start tightening, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar passage, thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheels with locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you’re an 80s boy, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of questions letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with a occurring self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, 3-7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game barely larger than a flashbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to set up words by placing the blocks in row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-armed competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than your toothbrush bristle, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the pass in a square in the city, seriously inspecting the nervous people in charge of him, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the bodyless policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their whimsical energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, despisingly.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of the uniforms to an allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating eyes: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a discovered snack cart, and watched it with the fringing eye constantly for half an hour, until the walking seller picked up his items and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the coughed police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China’s lowest respect for these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative sentences.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passing man after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively beat criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai walking watermelon salesman suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available to download online, introduces inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," said China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for “really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real homework or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial traits."
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the female candidates’ external qualities will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc.”
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
Female chengguans are like vases, he said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But she noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial traits.
If this means being pretty, it’s a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
“We can’t let a catch or a rabbit come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his coloured cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
Her hollow co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t oppose their job at a time-determined time, they said, because they have bigger career ambitions than simply evicting sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces about a dozen street vendors who jump on foot or on a bicycle, trying to sell as many pans or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told her many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily leaving his bicycle-drawn carriage with noodle trims.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is roughly the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, riot after the false rumor that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman spread.
More than a dozen Chengguan police officers or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed roughly.
The situation stagnated for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturality.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
Senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign for criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobby work for the wife’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely happy" with the decision, which came after an entire year investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure by the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Department of Justice had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email, and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobby work, to achieve Hampton and his wife, Cynthia,'s silence about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to disagree with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban”, which seeks to restrict former state employees using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several important setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to quit the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview he received a phone call from a Justice Department attorney on Monday and another further call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got lobby work thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was “madding” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to swiftly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them “shooting” in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the awful testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the broadly followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is ready to reach an official end, with the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have submitted court papers outlining the arguments of appeals that will likely occupy courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’ senior defense attorney.
First Instance Judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by the passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeal courts have acknowledged that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be needed to control the way of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Law, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them horrifying photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw wood into the fire of emotion about the case.
“Daily crowded media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
Her attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said appeal courts were often attracted to the arguments about adaptation required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made clear that they would demand that new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the 21st century Sheppard vs. Maxwell case."
Can civicism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week a bit of civicism has been triggered in Washington.
Is it a premonition of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues that should be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the remaining political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a trial period, surveying each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
Reason for which the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent assessments by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed regarding how things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections awaken partisan passions, which then extinguish.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment allowances, probably because Republicans can’t make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy, denying unemployment allowance for unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday’s White House meeting, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuing bipartisanism when the new 112nd Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things to be done are done, psychology will in the short term reverse the situation to a confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and cancel the new health law.
Those support lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission ' s recommendations, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cutting of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the question of the deficit into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected panel officials, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would the change cause?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanness of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing will probably change course and seek engagement.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now bigger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find points in common on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city’s control is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money raised directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service are managing huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when he was asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that he suggested was corrupt, he said, “It’s madness, it’s crazy, it’s annoying.”
According to polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it’s unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy’s report, and it’s unheard of that diplomats of a foreign country are doing that.
“The direct links of the Moscow city’s government with crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to claim that the government functions more like a cleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) that passes the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
“Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s commercial owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s Moscow expert group, in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy note, which did not occur until late evening Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for the weaknesses of Moscow, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
Red Khmer veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly illuminated concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodian mixed court issued the first sentence of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Khmer of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Khmers, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“To them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is generating divisions within families.”
During the Cambodian Red Khmer rule, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to desert towards government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Khmer fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Khmer elite officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, rough soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have gained little after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Khmer was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply ourselves.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute leading leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Khmer rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are believed to have died.
During a recent stunning afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a ground road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Khmers.
She said that if the court called her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to re-unite the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Red Khmers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed on Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Khmer, despite the city’s bond with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are unsure about how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Khmer retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a oxidized canned roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of mature bananas in hopes of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce reserve of uranium qualified for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus were carried out in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weapons from a Belarusian investigation facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday’s deal to remove the remainder of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The deal seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the deal was “a very significant and important step” taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically arms-qualified uranium) and low-enrichment uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the facility of research with low-enrichment uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence” that led to the Clinton-signed deal.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s rough repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential distension.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish government did not complain about CIA flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners directed to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish executive to be informed in order to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft that cross Spain."
In June 2006, following a report from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting took place between former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council’s report “had taken the Zapatero government out of play” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights across Spanish territory.”
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unwary piled," Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "would want to give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited ability to influence".
In January 2007, Attorney Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminatory elements or sensitive information," the embassy said after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are raviously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government deliberately tolerated or ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government,” he said.
The paricide confessed complained in the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman spoke of the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terrorizing the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he employed from a childhood, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natural of Noia, the Corunhes people from which she is originating.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimonies from their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When she left, she soon learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get his DNA test.
He soon met another friendship.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
With him he lived for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and she wrote: "Alberto is very weird and messy, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have freedom to do whatever he wants.”
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile he just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child.”
She complains, “If she doesn’t like to leave the kid with my mother, I’ll pick him up when he comes back,” she says.
In May, he talks about the return to his town: "This week I'm going to stop there, but I'm only going to be until 19, because on 20 I have to present myself to a job so that I don't lose it."
She clarifies that if everything goes well, she takes her first-born.
"It's going to be with whom it owes, that is, with me, and I'll never think of leaving it with anyone but my mother again," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and allegedly murdered on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the boy) to some summer classes, and so save me a little babysitter pasta."

Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has the view on the generals because, whether it is advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this formation gets in those elections usually doubles that it gets in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomous votes, the number was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nurtured by a transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - now it has three - while ICV would either stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relief at the head of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be crazy for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory – 5% of the votes need to be obtained – .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the turn in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell has provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Police Information Office in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the bomb attacked in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" internationally and, therefore, "its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeit and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only that the jihadist network had operations in Europe, hence in the investigations participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory similar coups will be carried out in the coming days to that developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanese detainees were Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanese Butsanets and Muhammad Zemhar.
These were those who directed the cell settled in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - primarily stole from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents must be on behalf of men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The media underlines that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the bombing in Mumbai, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeit in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, some $1,000 were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that was "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP demands that Mas park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarised in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without philosoferanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the leader wants in his national leader.
The president of the popular Catalans went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that it gives to having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday’s elections, a figure more than enough to make himself wanted, as the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote for investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the talks that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "will have to park all sovereignist and independentist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
The two leaders have in common their commitment to slimming down the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax on inheritance and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with, on the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC), Joan Herrera (ICV), and today will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to “lack of measures”
Olot centre owners do not rule out that their celler killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat of Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm that the institution has caused the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven seniors who had in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to carry out the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civilian responsible".
And it is that in addition to the social disregard that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the celler in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the auto ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the proceedings were dispatched by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, yesterday sharply denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s attorney added that “in the case there is no single indication that there has been an imprudent action by anyone other than the accused himself.”
He already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat notes that it is difficult to control that the center’s staff have access to the medications.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his effort to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the cellier, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of acting after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors sharply reacted yesterday to Trichet's threat that he warned "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is proper to an illiquid market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take long to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to be withdrawn tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demands completion of the ineffective public debt purchase plan and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future, leaving only unlimited weekly access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue with your bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, the bazuca announced Monday and Wednesday said it had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday’s one-year auction in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Nevertheless, rates in Portugal dropped 30 base points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still has not enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension in the face of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which a political commitment is needed to prove that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of action that will be approved Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revitalize employment sound in investors’ ears like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been fast and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will be benefited by the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dissipate doubts about our refinancing ability.
For Spain to ask for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available three times that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets without it.
Nevertheless, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “in addition to being, seeming to be.”
Brave, we can.
President of Eulen to challenge Vega Sicilia board requested by his children
The storm does not grow in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full-right null", the board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and get the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are tuning the legal drums for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to cede in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves as administrators at the shareholders’ assembly on January 18th of this year and whose contestation is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for next day 16, convened by the judge of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the dispute is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest move of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal from the applicants his five children to, through procedural argucia, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18, according to his portfolio.
This argument will be the basis for, once the board has been held, to proceed to its contestation by considering it to be "fully void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This matter is the substantive matter that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal appeal is held, for which there is no date yet appointed.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship all bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of the Fernando Alonso.
Without despising the skill as a driver of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computing instrument at its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during racing and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young, highly qualified professionals, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the balloons.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s balloons with the exception of the engine, which is Renault’s entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million amount that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its boilers in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two riders, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety zero.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says five years ago that R&D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computing since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 stores with local dealers in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in collaboration in Barcelona yesterday, its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, the vice president of HP Spain, put as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The U.S. group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to unveil the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP Personal Systems assured that the philosophy of installing stores will always be the same, relying on a local dealer with experience and industry knowledge.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s warranty computer equipment.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
“This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical support services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and anticipates the end of the liability war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a drop in interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private clients in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011, which will be valid for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the recruitment of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - its large pending subject, since so far it had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the basics of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks at this time dare to set themselves goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year’s Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it extend one more year.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the liability war—which penalizes margins—is falling, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to offset the falling margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year it’s going to move everything,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are “highly rising” and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution will go into red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplie the market in raising funds in the face of further recapitalizations.
After assuring Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of markets, it declined importance to what some bankers already anticipate as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in boxes
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed a wave of savings box mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When it started the process of concentrating the Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I think the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
“The majority is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot in that too,” he said.
In statements during a breakfast from the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España," he stressed.
“Moving from 45 boxes with an average asset volume of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much bigger to meet Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of fairly unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Banco de España does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The executive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banking went very well off from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies for placing or abolishing the 426 euros of assistance to unemployed unemployed, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Loterias.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of nut in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which collides with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s rescue decision.
Already then he was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published were strongly against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and in the coming months we should assist in the process of reform of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although we must now take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, are simply not going to tolerate it.
The envite is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will give way to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has paved its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t seem like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Alonso and Ramos’s bullshit against the Ajax shows ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly urged by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sports or not and whether, eventually, both players were to be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to make mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the competition, against the Auxerre, and will be able to move clear of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team’s coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written but followed by this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the reported case is because it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and which has occasionally fined its players for similar acts) and the drama orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions fraud of law is committed; because, indeed, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but they seem to circumvent their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of opposing players, aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these goods referred to in fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done hiddenly to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious thing to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They looked forward to and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not placed in disadvantage or gained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players fulfil a penalty game and move to the second card cycle, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor the most of what the rules allow.
In the case we are concerned, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without running out of the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, I think this time it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offer to capture group Christmas dinners at BCN
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reserves for 16 and 17.
Self-supported celebrations are proliferated by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the catering and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices sector to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, match the meals.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely moved for the previous week.
As it has been since 2008, when the stage of lean cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the conjunction, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be.
“People think about it long before booking.”
“He wants to leave but has the alerts on on the topic of prices,” he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and remembers that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey at various central establishments noted the collapse of petitions for the night of 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjunction, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early reservation, even since early November.
“We have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
In AN Group, which deserts El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group note that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident in starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises big concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than on the rise, “decreases,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored in components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists this in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Councillor, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is viewed, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to keep guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The novelty of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-decreasing US-Pakistan cooperation on issues of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan “fructuous,” says: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are unanswered or dismissed.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence official, noted that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also urges Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani army must end tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist officer to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the moves and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow Assange's moves."
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it does not have to do with the latest leakage of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse the Australian faces in Sweden.
Additionally, Wikileaks founder’s attorney Mark Stephens said that “police knows where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from that country’s authorities.
Interpol’s 188 countries have indications to identify or locate Assange “for his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed to an arrest -- which must be undertaken by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks has been willing to respond by videoconference to Swedish authorities’ questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
"This seems like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the statement said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, she granted an interview with the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which she called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to undermine Assange contrasts with views these days proclaimed conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or aid."
Further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to withdraw after saying Assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever in the government has leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be a too kind punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with swings to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the eighth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation amago is insufficient for the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as diluted today as his own mentor and can at all cause him the headbreaks he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with swings that allow him to armor himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC counselors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By papers, not by lifted hand.
If the carodists want to carry a certain vow of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of line wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that neither would a result be good "to the Bulgarian".
The next ones to Carod demand from the president something more than putting his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To do so, they hope to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the congress in autumn 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty cloths of doors inwards.
In this line, the article that Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós ideologist, the headline of Innovation assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of whom two stand out.
The first is to “recompose” the executive to account for at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector affiliated to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly once as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it encourages a reform of the statutes that allows to hold congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion left the management to review the assembly at a specific congress on statute reform.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of recent years was discouraging to tackle the matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it can be a good time to resume it and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.

In Ixtapaluca, with firearm shot in the neck, the body of a woman was found alive in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
Tattoos of the Holy Death were detected on the woman’s skin, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with a head pregnant and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.

Next to him, the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country’s representative at COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed its offer to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
Indeed, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He made it clear, however, that China will not alter its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community in that matter.
He said that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these sections, progress has been made, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy-efficient use and emissions reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, funded by both the Chinese government and governments of other countries, have been abundantly underway or already completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent spots by savers, and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to that country’s government on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and plans to do another one by 2020, he added.
Attached to Legality Expulsion of Spine: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right to refer, if necessary, through a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the sphere of a competent body," he noted.
He said it was not time to think about 2012 and that there was never an alliance at the negotiating table for the presidential candidature.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will be strengthened from the internal election of December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and achieved the goal,” he said.
The Panista leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said the council will undoubtedly be able to choose the best or best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the estafeta "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party's president."
He predicted that the rebound that recorded the party in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming disputes, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this framework, he emphasized that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, yearnings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet expectations".
Asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the four years of his rule, César Nava called on Priists to reflect on the sexennials of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He thought that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like the ones he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no jaw or much less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that is expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other drafts such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other drafts, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs confided that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule can be set for the rest of the drafts.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
“I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a “closing-debate vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at times when organizations supporting the project lead intense lobbying to ensure the passing of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their back on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the Maine Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Utah's Orrin Hatch and Texas's Kay Bailey Hutchinson, but have stated they won't back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Tongue was a walk where the participants gave a narrative show.
"That of Sex in the tongue I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the tongue, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion explained the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sex.
The finger in the wound... "puts us in trouble", sweetly whipped the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young, who appointed himself at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "cry" is, goes from physician to physician, of whom he does not get answers but clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: “Pacience is not my strength, it may be my wound.”
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: “the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar.”
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interrogated.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exposed a delightful narrative titled Praise of the Invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a moment is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer, who played the same clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maid, a narrative that turned to talk later America, the great novel that did not miss from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it and quoted the captains of Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized it.
“Cervants who invented us all (the writers) mocked the pretended witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with imagination that lacked to the point of shame.”
However, he highlighted "the madmen and the deceivers are the ones who imagine the best" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that of the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the "cervantine tradition."
“By his inheritance we are what is told.”
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero acclaimed and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman pointed hers toward the great wound of social violence that her country – and it shares Latin America – is the product of drug trafficking and sales disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit compromise that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the compromise that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that results in dogmatisms, forgetting that “behind every claim there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
“To be owners of our thoughts and to be owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting a finger in the wound and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about cartoon, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance, and also bothering the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times, although so far has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting with the sub-champion’s medal, has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The santist strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was carrying the rules of Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the 2003 Clausura he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 global and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenario Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up drawing 2-2 against the choriciers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty round he took the lead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the malice and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is most important," said the timonel when questioned about the numbers he has against playing the finals.
"The only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we were already prepared to run out and I think that's a teaching, until the match is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that doesn't disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty round, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately that did a bad move, sometimes that wasn't to have the title.
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technician sub-champion and test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
US changes rules to obtain a visa
Individuals will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will be changed at the U.S. Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) before their interview with the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, you will no longer need to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application, and another one for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for visa for merchants and investors.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this section less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Extraterrestrial Life Finding
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will make an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could prove the theory that there is alien life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life,” which aroused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that they thought were uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they would become intelligent beings like humans if they improved the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and opposition 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when in Congress an opposition bloc emerged, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'throne' against the reform of the Organic Law, since they excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts 'bipartisanism', because now it will be two people, of equal numbers of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their character as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo detailed that with these reforms institutionally the political marginality of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and this ended the opposition coalition.
“However it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolic, now be "duopolic."
“It is not the spirit of reform to the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergence abunded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress has currently become a ‘booty’ between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a match, now they’re sharing it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not for cupular agreements, leave out 5 that we're probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we've decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that's the issue that in the reform they made they agreed, we're out and we don't agree with that reform."
Another $200,000 for "Supplier"
Pays City Hall of Mazatlan another check to the contested owner of electrical equipment company.
A more cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money from the Commune would come out in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State’s Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks are missing for being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as stated by the Act when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not re-used its services.
The above, after on July 25, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to meet tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Gold Zone Traders Association, recalled that on several occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take it back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, otherwise they would not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning.”
Hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so because giving preventive maintenance and not falling solely in the corrective," he said.
"We are looking forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
“There has not been given due attention and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of a tourist vocation.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we will have to order first, clean and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Request IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies take the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals a total of 40 popular representatives, was installed.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that deputies will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to protect their own interests and become carnival comparisons of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions.”
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to bring the Governor forward in turn.
“We take care that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Signaoenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the state’s economic growth, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will encourage the creation of jobs.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight it holds within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agribusiness industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects that help in giving security to the state and in the update to the Alcohols Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a magic king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, next Kings Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in the Colonia Salvador Allende and they live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"We sometimes find it tough because my husband has no camba, but we sell mandarin and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the kids.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a ‘monster’ carriage and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes sized for a year.
“He said to me, ‘I want this monster,’ but I said, ‘Let’s go see son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign Looking for a Wizard, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been detained who will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their detention.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
About seventy police officers from Estrie's Quebec Security Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this operation.
It will be able to fight clandestine migration without problems
The conservative bill that, according to the government, should solve the problem of the paters loaded with illegal migrants, will surely face great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I mainly rely on the Charter."
“I meet here with a party that has created the granite you step on,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against those in charge of clandestine wickedness and that’s what we aim for with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and disregarding the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell deputies that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as if it were a bluff.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the government is going to request a vote so that each MP who opposes will then explain to his electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation is a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Thus, Tuesday’s announcement has surprised more than one.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic dealing with the public security issue, Stéphane Bergeron, to label this announcement as “a rabbit taken out of the chister” and as “a last-minute bluff solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
“You will see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ Chairman Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more obstinate Mr. Charest is in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have an investigation commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadline, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the General Interventor to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the general speaker’s mandate,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the speaker the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his counterpart for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcyclist groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were detained.
Subsequently, Ottawa encouraged the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, the houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls are added to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will flood.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some of the lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to unfold.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a prevention measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several lakes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Center, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growing of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback in the Canadian Council of Radio Television Rules (CCNR) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as his rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduely negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also noted that debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on emissions disseminated between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with the suicide, presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee consider that the episodes challenged by Dupont le midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and adequate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been discarded in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the Haitian earthquake.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media clash that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had made no donations to help Haitians because he couldn’t know for sure if the needy were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduely negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension there upstairs."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of rude language.
In any case, the radio channel CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required."
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest hearing within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montréal of Algerian origin Naceredine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008, explained.
“In my case, I’m looking for combat everywhere because for those who don’t enjoy the game on the ground that mixed martial arts involve, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the company UPS, recently gave bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held from October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been making progress in every competition.”
“At this point, I’ll be the first one this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to beat with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, on a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain one competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who won me is a true professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are confronted in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie Gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a price rise.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly,” Sylvain Simard, a member of the Party, said in a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lack of rigor."
He noted that “the minimum” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec’s merchant record allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labor dynamic and Hydro-Québec specifically responds to it since the 1970s."
The great Eastmain project manager, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation highlighting the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the sector’s actors and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Energy Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its stake in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, it amounts to $449,783,344, including the energy management contract of $295.131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Canadian consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pull messages that advocate for more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers it even curbs their commitment.
Even though consumption of products called “socially responsible” has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Responsible Consumer Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates that carry products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "ecoresponsible," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, which is currently supported by nearly a third of consumers in Belgium.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to dismiss this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of 100 this year), Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to occupy the position of recycling king trying to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be doors (from his car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the cinema complex eXcentris after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris at Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return to him his true cinéphile vocation, have not obtained what they asked.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be less than initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallele and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely dismissed.
Remember that the Association of Owners of Cinema and Film Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector are calling for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the resort, has been carrying the burden of author cinema at its premises for ten years, after financing its own construction, which could justify a revocation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to loyalty to its clients.
The company Angus and Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pursuing a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks uncover what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ complex with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflects the latter’s feeling of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports on the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanations about this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador has even more difficulty understanding this "deceitful silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more, the party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His journey will help ensure the government’s survival during the vote of trust in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will register for the first time a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” Mr. Breese wrote.
Nowhere is mentioned that the government had to extend the parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image transmitted by the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods in relation to the WikiLeaks site have warmed up.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "killed."
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to virtually one-third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to offset the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopoly between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED"), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuer countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, pledged to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, further 5 Gt of that amount should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostates and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain nothing mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluo-compact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity waste with the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report outlines the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save itself $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Ask all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline on Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline ended, the CIS president had told television that the committee “continued working” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the requests for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo side has been annulled by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the campaign of the president of Ivory Coast, said the intimidation manoeuvres of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be void if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who deny any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have put the grid on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on October 31 with 38% of the votes versus 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected with provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The second quarter data have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In a year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not available within two weeks to work and whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Only unemployment stability has been recorded among people between the ages of 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has been without publication of the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy about its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate poses to him, not ghosts."
“It’s easy to persecute him for a multitude of reproachable acts, another thing is to prove them,” her lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday evening they began investigating and imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, says lawyer Simon.
In the context of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday, for misuse of funds and complicity, but he has been left probationally and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The instructor magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has released him," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and left free, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with “trafficking in influences and passive corruption.”
Two officials in Aubagne’s township, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for “restraining and misuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service” and for “complicity in misuse of public funds”, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering abuse of social property.”
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their societies have served to launder the capital of great banditism.
The investigation is being conducted within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation notes that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elisha has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has been on the public in France, has warned of diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attentive eyes of U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on how to manage their own “hostage” crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French commentary on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elisee counselor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk to U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying manoeuvres.”
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require a large amount of money to be granted to Iranians" (€230,000 in reward).
Furthermore, he notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “will increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris on a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iran’s clandestine networks for procurement of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Releasing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that it wasn’t so.
The Elisha, he says, not only "has been enormously surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot cancel the judicial decision," he said.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The counselor of the Elisha marks a phone number, hangs and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, uses media-organized communiqués and “leaks” to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that the manipulation bears its fruits, since several newspaper articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
What is the reason for such “gratitude” to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praising statements, French officials acknowledge in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Then the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness towards Syria,” he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been spotted of premature and undeserved."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
“At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Eliseus.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio for playing an “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
Starting at midnight, Korean youth can’t play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called Cinderella that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, according to representatives from the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“A lot of kids play all night, and then they find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precisely.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people so request, he added.
Furthermore, it will make free software available to anyone requesting that allows limiting the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive internet usage.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicion of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) nominations have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the corruption suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the burning on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dismay FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron heading.
The Chief of Government hopes to re-edit the successful blow by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the J.O.O. 2012 for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain the brightness of England before the EC?
It is unclear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the shady economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliations against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they manage is to give points to Russia, converted into a weighty outsider despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadions, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the English press' allegations against EC members.
“They are shining their dirty cloths, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The world’s leading economic power and home to FIFA’s top sponsors, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World Cup grant to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to go out of chance by 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV fees paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had doubted.
Mitterrand had indicated that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
As a result, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, we must always seem to doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, though they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision “at some point in autumn 2011.”
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP deputies on Tuesday evening at the Elisha, the possibility of "two terms" has provoked some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidature?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He just passed on the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he talks about presidential elections, in a joking tone, in meetings of this kind.
“In the worst, or better, of cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about what's coming next."
His claims before yesterday do not bring him closer to the nomination, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal came up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad surveys.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon’s candidature to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
“We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the issue,” the Prime Minister’s environment immediately and prudently reacted.
“If you think you can lose, you won’t be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to clarify the ways of exiting the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
During a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in resolving the European debt crisis.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its purchasing program of state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
On the eve of his hearing before the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet did not show more eloquent in terms of his intentions, merely indicating that the secondary market State Letters purchase program “continued” and that “we will see what we decided” at Thursday’s meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate invariable at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
Moreover, according to indiscrete market operators, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant changes in course.
Although loan operations longer than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations at beneficial conditions and with duration ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
“I don’t think he’s going to modify his program considerably.”
“If not, it would be at risk of causing new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur," says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order for the market to remain stable," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must offset at any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked increase in returns paid by the most fragile states,” an important bond manager said yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are clouded, states will have even more difficulty reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi captures the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the bond rate reflux to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the outset of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and that a weekend was expected to be "unpredictable", statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk hedge contracts (CRQ) had climbed to 263 points, causing a certain upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deeply concerned" about "the turmoil in the markets" and a possible infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have entailed a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the holidays, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will need to be adopted," said Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either short or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required to other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period that would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde said: "I think we have already shown Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in European states’ bond rates has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculations today.
“Like in May, political clarity and transparency really lacks, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this gap and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying debates to strengthen existing mechanisms for exit from the crisis.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin earlier next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFF), its chief executive officer, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday began a tour of Asia in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issuance of ERDF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid, at all costs, seeking international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider indispensable to build trust in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injections.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, which is currently provided with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could undoubtedly examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in Île-de-France.
Snow layers are expected between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Île de France and Lemosin.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driven except in case of need and the traffic of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the traffic of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has called on airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris’s Roissy airport and 10 percent in Orly on Thursday because of the expected snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the Isle of France has reached its peak, billions are raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the state has announced an allocation of funds of €4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this sum will allow the SGP to subsequently obtain loans in the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, which was examined by the National Assembly’s finance committee this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of an excise duty on equipment and the increased duty on offices in the Île de France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The income of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would this method get?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
“It is precise that tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that the state will mobilise and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we can read in the statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment that income is created (the two taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain.”
"It will be registered in the budget and used according to the needs."
The SGP estimates that it will begin receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the $4 billion promised is not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly ignited parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it unveils an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be scandalized by the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has taken a long time to give ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule according to which secret records should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those engaged in occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sending the U.S. embassy to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published last week.
So why have the revelations of these records caused such a revolt?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become spying centers.
Any spectator who watches research movies knows it perfectly, we just appear that we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the State Department’s prestige.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “verdicts.”
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
Anciently, in Orwell’s time, he could be conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape a hacker’s control, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power stand that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty, unsecret secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets.
WikiLeaks hasn’t hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that in the future States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also obvious that, with current technologies, we cannot expect to keep confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prospect is a science fiction and therefore a novel, but I can imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned out of memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: ultimately, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology now progresses like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph (telephone).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel involved, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
A last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly plotted at the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s shortcomings in its financing pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing pledges (fast start or early calls) made by developed countries have been fulfilled.
And the French dips have been unveiled.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency resulted in appreciation and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track toward meeting its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without damaging official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, believe that each euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission reduction projects that are based on more effective technologies), it is mistaken to present a euro that will be recovered as the equivalent of one euro being donated... As a matter of course, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for its own eyes.
It is the only EU country that so often uses the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, comply with their commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and, on the other hand, in relation to real financial effort.
Spending just €36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he spends €420 million “new and additional,” as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems Bercy has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) as in negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a detail, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012 with the intention of fulfilling its commitments and in the same way as the other European Union countries.
But in particular, France could push forward the debates on betting at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international trust needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingested 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", purchased in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The dish balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as potential or likely carcinogens, and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to acting as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
“Although, in virtually all cases, legal limits for each of the chemicals individually are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about a twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were dressed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk generated by these “pollutant cocktails” for the consumer “is likely underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to impose a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
