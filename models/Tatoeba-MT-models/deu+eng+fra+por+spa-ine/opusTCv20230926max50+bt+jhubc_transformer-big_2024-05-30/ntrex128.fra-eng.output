Members of the Wales Assembly worried about “showing as puppets”
Welsh elected officials are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be mocked.
One Labour elected said his group is concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Walesian readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crust.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, indicated that "the final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly belongs to the latter".
The Government of Wales Act (Government of Wales Act, 2017) grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the issue of the title of members, the Commission is in favour of Welsh Members of Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the Chairman of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the issue of the name during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on change of country name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia is a demand on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in trouble, Saint Martin bells silenced
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and church at every corner of the street,” Adams says.
“There is no more today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have been rare.
Today, “we no longer meet in the same way,” he explains.
“Before, we went to the bar like our neighbor’s, but that’s no longer the case.”
As for churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the officials imagine and this worries him: “Sooner or later, they will return to the starting box.”
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the neighborhood’s last sanctuaries.
“People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely whites who will rush the closure of all churches, as it is unlikely they will become members of them,” he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist congregation abandoned the place in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of boutiques on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks were struggling to get employed or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon.
Father Johnson’s son and successor to St. Martin Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
It also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been a lot of concern about the revolt of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a management body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old teenager wounded by shark during lobster fishing
According to authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old man last Saturday as he was fishing lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the boy was crying out with joy that he had a catch, and then he realized that in reality he was
had been bitten.
When arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicule.
“I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water: There’s a shark!” explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to San Diego's Rady Children Hospital, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the UK Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's low-handed on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fills them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with cosmetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetic market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home items are falling, larger beauty products shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Today, supermarkets are investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings by up to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in sectors similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its makeup line Shop to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and a second which is scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said outlets will look more and more like large-scale outlets as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has helped drive sales of current consumer goods and profit the acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the UK chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetic shelves had resulted in a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a controversy about the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
After selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty products shelves has been modified to improve the customer setting.
“We have also invested in training so our staff can provide wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the embellishment of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones Anger After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Angry with the star of Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract linked to her home decoration brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to take care of the Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior design business at the last minute to devote herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry when television's beloved child revealed, at a meeting that took place at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth 1.5 million pounds, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their interior decoration brand and accessories.
The Truly brand has been assimilated to actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host’s fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
and to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; the 52-year-old Jones joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples were on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was awful, but we finally love each other.
Trump has mocked the media who criticizes him because of his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and to prove so positive toward the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He said, taking a voice of a TV journalist.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations on this denuclearization are dead.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s head of diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday to world leaders at the UN General Assembly that he did not see any “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regrets that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his gathering speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” said the U.S. President.
We closed the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile-fire tests, the release of hostages, and the remains of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there are just over 200 standing in front of me,” he said.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been declared as a prerequisite for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they do not want international aid, which makes things a little more complicated,” Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to travel to Palu, it still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shaking, the country lacks cruelly means to shelter itself from the caprices of nature.
Shelter has been set up in Aceh, but it is rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given, no sirens of alarm sounded at Palu, which probably contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scenes of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed decaying infrastructure reform at the center of his election campaign and has spent considerable amounts to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Joko’s government, which is called to represent before voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from persistent inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes, on the background of street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring at the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was running from 1 to 0.
He shooted in the ball on his left, before escapeing a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ended up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its road at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, to take the ball, but players like Shaq are always shooting as far as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker took a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before heading to the midfield and sprintering on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic performed a quick go-and-go in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep shooting that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard exceeded the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the Champions League group phase on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami deaths to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are stuck under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shake the country on Friday and triggered 6-metre-high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency spokesman told a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 07:55 a.m., the 44-year-old knife-stretched woman was discovered in John Street at Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old suspected of murder was arrested.
Police urge residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspected of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers who might have captured something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information that is crucial for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman appeared at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him voiceless.
Residents were informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
Repeating, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cord, and another outside.
Several officers were watching the building on the inside of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Failure agency at 0800 555 111, indicate the September 30 registry 247.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt."
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "Given the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that that of Oliver Cromwell erected in front of the Westminster Palace was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defense of parliament against external pressures, I mean of course the monarchy.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-seventeenth century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated.”
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as Mr. Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery trenched and covered with blood near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that a door from the neighboring pig store was open.
He claims that there was a huge male pig inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A forensic-medical report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pets.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was not owned by the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of breeder Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a wife and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig caught a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from it.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behaviour.
“These are animals rather playful.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeast of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the north-eastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rainfall in northeastern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1) hurricane from 5 pm east time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula as a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with coming depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains may lead to sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into unraveling rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the California coastline.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause small debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rainfall of the region’s dry season.
Scattered tropical rains will reach Arizona on Sunday in the late day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Important temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures rotating around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, roughly 10 degrees above the average season.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures are expected to be above the average in the eastern United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the striking hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political impasse continues, broadcasting services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a breakthrough: an agreement imagined by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured herself to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the effect of alcohol, had engaged in touches on her person and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% sure that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
For comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts have widely supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the most watched channel on the auditions day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of up to 3.26 million.
Followed were CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken after the hearing was finished.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the Moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was caught by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to get to the court hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN was broadcasting the sequence of the interrogation live.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe that he’s telling the truth?
You have power while so many women are in need.”
Before the lift doors were closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and he would say more about it at the commission meeting.
All cable and broadcast network channels covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the accusations made against the candidate, as the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice was heavy on the balance, as the Republicans would indeed not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making “small politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plan to leave the European Union, to make “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “authorly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect of the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was crushed and accused of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the forensic physician of the Baton Rouge parish published a preliminary report Friday, which determines that the death was caused by a bullet injury that passed through the head and stayed in the neck.
The police acknowledge the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, as well as citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked law enforcement for their “engagement and quest for justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and in shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
“We are always afraid of this kind of event,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcano spitting ashes
Ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a peak activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumours and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcano activity 72 km from the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Confrontations between police and separatists on the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independentist protesters and riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder on them, creating clouds of dust on the streets, which usually do not deem employ tourists.
Heatings also broke out later in the day, while police used batters to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who screamed “neither forgetting nor forgiveness” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life to Spain.”
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to local press.
One year after the October 1 referendum, deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions in the independentist region still live.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite low participation rates, with secession opponents boycotting the referendum largely.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It still had place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“We witnessed a great time last year.
“My parents were crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we are in a stalemate,” he said.
Despite their capital, though slim, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independentist parties struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting for trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who films the police support demonstration on his phone, says politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting judgment since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament election next year.
“This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit home by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly entering a house in Londonderry.

Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot by arrows.
Livingston wins 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently climbed to grade, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox club coach.
Menga's goal made the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place second in the ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of a victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face Sunday the Hearts team, which leads 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its unbeaten course in the division by six games, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may boast of not having lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of depressed opponents
Holt's team could have taken ahead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a headpass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could disrupt them with worked tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and the Livingston tried an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touch and set a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor stopped a Scott Pittman hit, while Lithgow managed to overcome one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mistake.
The "phenomenon" of Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and team composition have virtually not changed since their return to the top, but the merit is largely back to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
It has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerrard, they have not been up to their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to pierce the opposing side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
A number of issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in his country.
The divide that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies from a car collision
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescues arrived on site, but the man died on the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said the officers were doing their utmost to identify the individual and warn his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 agents injured in riot
The high-security men’s prison official said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialist riot agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving eight detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for mild injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order to the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences prolonged.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot agents were sent to jail to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is probably what will happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcement rainfall as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the stage of depression or tropical storm within a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert, including the central area of the Rockies and the Greater Basin, are expected to record rainfall of 2.5 to 5 cm, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be saving for areas affected by drought that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Even if the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast, in the Lower California Peninsula.
Also powerful Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these rainfalls will result in potentially fatal sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the side of Radstock.
Agents called on people who could have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh was the victim of Democratic wickedness and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republicans' participation in mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party collaborator’s statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of casualties, score continues to grow
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, most of them carried away by huge waves that crashed on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when waves of six meters tall overwhelmed the beach at dusk, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn’t flee immediately, it cost their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t happen alone. It driven cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, saying the tsunami had moved to the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived as long as the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming frenziously to passing on the street as a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell down on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity failure that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun transporting aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit Palu’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami victims increased, more than 800 were killed.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in the courtyard of their offices and discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba explains.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began relief to the disastered, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This catastrophe is still considered regional,” says Aulia Arriani, Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday’s tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Indonesian paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an ex in the paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtle $26,750 when recharging an ATM
Thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the site, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “formerly known as Kanye West.”
At the age of 41, West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his arrival for “emotional reasons,” the creator of the show explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“Then I am you, I am ourselves.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union line and the major letters.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody retaliation by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday pledged in Tlatelolco’s square “never to use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements rooted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of education opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its dedicated research funding in this sector, according to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors have made announcements regarding AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the U.S.
At the same time, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funds for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Double funding could double the chances that the next key step in the AI field will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player. He later joined the management team of Microsoft Reasearch and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
“It’s not China that takes over university leaders, it’s businesses,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that immigration policy changes could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Council of China announced its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in several months.
Macedonians participate in referendum on their country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, of which one of the provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the vote was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of voters registered after the poll.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small scene and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments, with the unemployment rate in the country exceeding 20%.
“I think a vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after submitting his bulletin.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of participants who intend to vote said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes are needed plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before evicting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of sending the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” team coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage in the Premier League match,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton pitch.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues' front sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55pm Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the festive turmoil against the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of a qualifying match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West Division.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still seeking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game is not at stake, we want to walk the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be prone to leave room for Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-wing is at 18-7 with an average deserved points of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220-step and two-thirds takes this season.
Trump’s Interventions in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation that his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court generated by talking about the importance of Republicans' participation in mid-term elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats angry, wicked, and liars.
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which gave him the opportunity to be haunted by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the biggest community it was.
He is not tolerant toward those who express their ideas.
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received the same treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
Notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That's exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of milder and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It became apparent that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power, and the colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect from me to turn my jacket back and take positions as opposed to my beliefs, whether it be about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and whatever I said, I was following an abusive social media shooting, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a party member.
And that's not just my experience.
Besides, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in admiration of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who are faced with an erupting sexist or racist speech every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in current politics is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted through motion for doubt and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years: to look down, not to express my ideas so loudly, and everything would go well.
But this is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local counsellor or government minister.
I have never hid my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities. I don't think it's really time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are Labourists or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests for all.
Chris Leslie is a parliamentary member for the Nottingham East district.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains unbeaten
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scotland Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only unbeaten team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that have allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
“Until now, we have been tested, but we remain unbeaten, so I have to consider myself happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Brave to them, they were more effective than we were and managed to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squadron Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half-time. He scored and turned a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a cradle. During the resumption, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall trial transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's interim captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unchanged essay of Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty touch, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's mouth, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the essay, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home essay.
Still Game star launches in restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “prosperous restoration environment” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol on an armoured boat in naval headquarters La Paz.
The public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is right to us.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost for the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present, just as the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades; Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement on a sovereign ocean transition to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issues its decision six months after the latest arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric undermined all the Chilean goodwill that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents to date - used the maritime problem as a political bend.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not drop its nuclear weapons until it trusts Washington.
Nothing was spoken at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to meet the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Nothing says it is “chimical” to think that the United States’ continued sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will make the North bend.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of prior significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest trends in head covers, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, don’t look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversize hats at a PE19 parade that honored the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
All more extravagant hats invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
The other oversize accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had the lips stitched and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled a dive equipment, with snorkeling and glasses, while another reminiscent of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you’re lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the "Bomba", the straw hat on a wide board that the stars rip off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hardly portable hat that flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model in swimsuit that wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, adorned with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags coming to shops for the next summer. The designer has marked the minds so much that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence, which continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and establish a trustworthy link with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results at the exams this year, we find that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages earned the highest rating, A.
Data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students received the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
Now languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission conducted in 2014 shows that among the difficulties that employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them lacked sufficient control of a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future reserves for them.
It is obvious that languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country at present, in a global trade environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans watching the debut of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the pre-season opening against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don’t know yet how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After training, earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote for the vacancy in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to gather support for the upcoming mid-term elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the question of the hearings of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, that took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims primarily to help Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. President said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans attempt to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an essential part of its agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible at this start of heavy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to try to revive him in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Ready to Fight to Keep Hope on Approach to Sunday Simples
After three singles, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balancer movement is a sporty concept invented in all the ways but that players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments like this one.
Where would they then place the momentum now?
“They were driving six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a little wings,” Spieth said as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel like they have a little wind in the back and have all the reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can boast of each having scored three out of four points.
Spieth has proven terribly effective from tee to green and sets an example.
A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth part while Thomas and he were led down two after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, aroused a similar scream, of those who tell you that he still believes the American team in the fight.
“You really need to stay determined and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair won four out of four games and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the delusional crowd, designate them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning fourballs, while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine strokes sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, advice they give and advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can shift in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made considerable advances over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong edge in the Ryder Cup last day after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Decided to retain the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by scoring 3-1 in the morning fourballs, against a messy American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two wins, but failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must win eight out of 12 points on Sunday in singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to score four consecutive points, while Molinari and he, nicknamed Molliwood after a breaking weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged during both Saturday games, has shined a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, these losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, one team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, only had to draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea declares that disarmament cannot in any case be unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions increased his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “important steps of goodwill” last year, such as putting an end to nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any corresponding responses from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known accusations of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it was gradually taking action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization like Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first summit between a current U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work in favor of a “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, opposing even "the declaration of end of war".
“Those who think these sanctions can make us do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.”
Nothing has commented on the U.S. leader’s second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the side concerned with the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s when he declared before the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after the “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened before the UN last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that there is still much to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years, or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the UN Security Council that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim demands the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Classes
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight the growing machist tendency to study by consuming caffeine all night.
A professor has noticed that most students from the world’s best university don’t know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached and asked me, “Why are you telling me that only in the last year?”
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the need to adopt good sleep patterns to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not instantly change the behaviour of students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and prompted him to insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and wake-uptime, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered a new heavy stroke outside, with Dolly Menga attacking leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first victory on the move since their 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at the drift, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers team, uninspired, failed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team choking his opponents at each round.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful blow toward Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and him collided, but Referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only took advantage of two first-time shots, but former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs’ arrested kick.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his coolness to choose Menga for an ending while simplicity.
Gerrard reacted to the half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing showed up in front of Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to make a block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor managed well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while fighting with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now, a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE COUNTER... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is this?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
“Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released in minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Tell me, I’m sure it’s going to jump out there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to teach the immune system how to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally inject them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of collecting immune cells to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Happy with a MAGA cap, Kanye West jumped into a Pro-Trump diatribe after his passing to the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West has been hailed on the plateau after a loose performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for the 2020 elections.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’”
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by actor Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was mocking West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a pit," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see him, the depth?” and claimed that he would wear his superman coat, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try love.”
His comments attracted him at least twice from the audience and members of the NLS seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. A person on the spot told the magazine: “A silence of death fell across the entire plateau.”
West was called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarmed a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the courageousest spirits: THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVE A TENT TO THE FOUL.”
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg bears the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince Fire, which changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Accused of attempted murder after a white-weapon assault at a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear Monday before the Belfast court of first instance.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor's office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a thin blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the violent medieval fantastic HBO series.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he said “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old star in Game of Thrones, admitted he was "strengthening" to address this issue.
“Personally, I deeply think we have mistreated masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men growing adults in relation to the problem that is now arising?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to his very male characters.
He continued, “What behaviour is innate, what behaviour has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys to think that they have to behave like this in order to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There is obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or follow-ups when the series ends next summer, claiming that it ended with “the battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will feature a reprise of True West, Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the encounter with his wife Rose was for him the best thing ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent in the number of its inhabitants with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to some parts of the country as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
However, from year to year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious issue.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to tackle this problem, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters deny that a GOP employee had disclosed data about the senators, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team allegedly posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these statements were supported by “extreme right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and still infamous lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, is under no circumstances responsible for the leakage of such information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the White House's former press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not question the accuser's grounds.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters headquarters in the mid-term elections, also spoke of his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the law enforcement authorities and agencies concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English struck again. Rowan Atkinson's parody, underdoped spy
It has now become a tradition to seek the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with squat eyes and a rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, owns a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, it was also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV advertisements, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the blades of the rotor were hitting his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible are confident about comedy.
Humor seems more children-oriented than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s mute film gags in Bean’s character.
The ever-current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great dismay of the agents in service - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of the crisis and who already suffers from political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that you have to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful stuffs here, as English offers a spying academy way Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency information gathering and finds Bough, his former long-standing partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create big trouble at Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the influence of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of wild jokes: under the costume of waiters, they set fire to a bright French restaurant; they create chaos by swarming on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All stops are assured for this last sequence, but nonetheless, there are a lot of things for kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t stop thinking, as with other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denied that it had drawn up a plan for the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still earning the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic program and plans to guide the country for workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source in the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers and its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week of work is not and is not considered by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "profiters" in utility enterprises.
The alternate Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full stake as the Labour government may make "deductions" due to alleged conduct gaps.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private corporate capital to employees, who will pock up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation of the charges against him and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could incite Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s vote seems engraved in the stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event featuring a very impressive list of stars and invested in an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people race to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, its first edition in 2012, is an extension to Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickativism” – a situation in which people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, advocating for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of over $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executors committed to “helping children develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in helping end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador, told the crowd at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the company’s more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve mothers and children’s nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great movements in defence of civil rights and fighting apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. Could Appeal to Navy to Create ‘Block’ to Block Russian Energy Exports
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” appeal to the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Secretary, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern central Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, together with our Navy, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, make obstacles to ensure that their energy is not marketed,” he added.
Zinke was addressing participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “energy consumer spokesperson” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, emphasizing that they are actually identical.
“As for Iran and Russia, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has “more than one rope at its arc” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at the time the Trump administration pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the “ inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said: “I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The US position has sparked negative reactions on the part of Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for presidential elections following the midterm elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider applying for the presidential election.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “driving this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of highly prominent Democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and certain injuries our soldiers come back with,” she told the public at the Donald Trump gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they are returning a little differently, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and each other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial protest against the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a briefing in favor of an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 Immigrant Appeal Board decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignorates decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be examined based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in his memoir.
Lawyers also recalled that immigrants’ refusal of entry policy harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to individuals who leave their home country on grounds of persecution or fear on grounds of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems—even the most serious ones—people encounter every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths double in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her fevery little boy in Palu, an evacuation center in the empty city.
“Every moment, an ambulance brings the bodies back.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen traveling to their destroyed houses, picking up unspoiled property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
Tears filled his eyes when he told him how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed in the ruins of the wall,” Haris told Associated Press, saying his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” Using “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday of the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation China refutes.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. elections, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press box you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the troubling Chinese economic trajectory, because the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters as midterm elections approach due to Kavanaugh’s debacle
While many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, claimed "that one cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute efforts in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters’ anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang “November is coming!” in the Senate hallway as Republicans running the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be oversized,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But this could be even higher, especially among suburban electors and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be vivid if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about committee voting or final voting, or Kavanaugh’s appointment, it’s also about how Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper.
As a result of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, however, the Americans seem divided about the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of people surveyed believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates Ford’s allegations and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake’s pressure.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand-new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s Solid free platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is backed up as well as the persons authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the launch.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings the appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to determine whether or not to make a complete change where all of their business models are completely swayed in a moment.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the aim of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an clergyman of the First World War decorated with the Cross of Victoria
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite sniper four days later and did not know that he had earned the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Channel “through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed onto the line of shooting and, with the "greatest bravery," guided the line before blowing up a field gun on his own and shooting three detachment soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “one thing I will never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be a part of the parade," adding that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete, viewers from the UK were sidred when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fighting.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, said: “Government regulations stipulate that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think of recasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you that this won't happen next time.
“We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we do usual – and we tried to give more to the fans and we spoiled everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “not everyone [was] like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's usual presenter, Kirsty Young, took a few months' leave because of her illness.
Appeared as a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The Olympic bronze double medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has benefited from his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to restore “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he was “not expecting” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013
Daley married last year his 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you experience so many things at such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said confidently that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was only thinking of winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
Her son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Daddy, you won’t be here to be in the first row anymore.’”
“I was holding him by his hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and die so I finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That was all I’ve dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympic Games, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, this inspired him his first choice of song - Pride of Heather Small - who had accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to straighten up to avoid this being an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was set off by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has been so often for the United States, the five-time grand champion split his day between the role of supporting and refining his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes lost strokes.
And as if the course wasn’t dreadful enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 single games, make a good start, Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a kick in the back, put his arm around me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of Ryder Cup matches disputed.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never fully reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven defeats, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he said.
“I think younger players had fun playing with him this week, which was fun to see.
He’s doing more than just playing.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not negligible advance before the simple ones of the Ryder Cup’s last day can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep remembering that we were leading widely to Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but with fairness,” Bjorn said, after watching the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go thoroughly tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything you need.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we must stay focused on.
I’ve always claimed to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow is a different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it is all different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested up to your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message to bring to the players is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind you, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to make sure his players get better scores individually than as teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these turns of the last day, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe ripped the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to bring his players together on the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to make this quick departure as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
“I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said on his selections in simple words.
Germany's new warship delayed
According to local media, the new German Navy fregate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace ageing warships dating from the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the concerning problems arising after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging fregates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealing technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fregates for up to two years outside the attached ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which should allow Germany to project its overseas force – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 fregat made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship manufacturer after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship unnecessary when deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class fregates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
Problems with new fregates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force decreases.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is actually “lack of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were declassified but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in a field of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common pipistriles and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of the habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will identify the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perch and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, just as flip papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections on the pier and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a great place for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding to maintain the properties, because by unwittingly destroying a single maternity nest, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what is happening in their populations at the moment.”
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as his lawyers prepare to prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to become known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Speaking to its 142 million fans in a live video posted on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
Oh, that's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called “unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the hotel-casino Le Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape had occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him of being a “good guy” at “99%” but he didn’t know what was going on with the remaining “1%”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she subsequently agreed to a settlement as she felt "frightened by retaliation" and feared "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve under a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK “would forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Commerce, the UK would “forever regret” if it lost its status as a world leader in automaking after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the possibility of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what car manufacturers call a supply chain risk in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tense flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be border disturbances that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and piece shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated in order to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that, as I said, will not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC’s Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that, in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the united factory union coordinator who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House Announces Trump and Rosenstein's Meeting May Be Delayed
According to the announcement made by the White House on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed by a week,” while the struggle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser in charge of investigating Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump’s employees and Russia, and possible barriers to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he appeared in the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints filed against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press attached Sarah Sanders made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we are pushing back another week given all the other things that are happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press up to date.”
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they astound the gallery."
Then, she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We have checked the figures.”
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you’ll be able to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
There are rarely alone press conferences.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and sometimes a weird appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
About concerns about Brexit, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman has sent a letter within six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of statutory applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the seconder of the Tennessee Tigers, was emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 defeat.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury had occurred just before half-time.
“He got on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a couch and taking it to another examination.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris said there was “no specification of the type or extent of the injury yet” and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five playoffs on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total of the season to 18 playoffs.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be used to strengthen government efforts in the struggle to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and prevents primary accessors from gaining a place in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who most of the time stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he urged May to waive quotas on affordable housing in order to resolve the "immovable disgrace" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the abolition of “without fault” expulsions.
It also wishes to give councils more powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who are not residents of the UK as well as for foreign companies to buy a home as for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become far away and the poverty of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is pleased to meet the challenge of renewing the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in Ligue 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I’ve been selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches in Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only occur if I succeeded in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic technician says he didn't hesitate to stand behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’”
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League.”
“It’s not easy to do that, but I’d probably only consider myself a success here if I managed to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa rise from a third-division relegation and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into the grand winner of the championship the following season.
Ross says he is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The takeover of Alloa "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it well, I earned my life well and I enjoyed some appreciable summits.
Playing is sometimes difficult.
There are lots of details to work out every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach fits me very well.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a poll, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 pm on Saturday.
The whirlwind of the summer has raised income from struggling British pubs, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pubs groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: “The permanent sunshine and longer than expected participation in the World Cup made that July followed the June model, where bars had risen by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The 1.8% decline in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are by far the most trendy, with more similarities than restaurants falling down.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restorers.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased 6.6% over the month and food decreased 3%.
Paul Newman, a recreational and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in off-home market sales.
There is no surprise that food groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food industry operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved rest.”
Total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant industry, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news increased concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — open an account on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they managed a “main” account cleaned up to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who incited others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, with half of students recognizing that they have private accounts.
MSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the steering body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for leaders of this sport to leverage his extensive international experience over the last ten years.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect within the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit enormously from his participation in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won in 1996 the 200 meters and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors claimed that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a tough job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Online, an advertisement on the milk puller that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milk pack compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what’s called the “world’s first silent milk pulley,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom her new milk pulley offers to breastfeeding women.
In a barn of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I betray myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women drinking the milk.
However, the advertising, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it lights up the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s a trauma understandable to both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk cupcake for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added: “A so disconnected advertisement.”
Others defended advertising, for example a woman admitting she found the song "hilarant".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who draw their milk (often at work or the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.”
It is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women revealed to have danced with the discreet milkshakers hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk pull is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even out while pulling out their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's made the first newspaper.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration’s strict speeches and policies have made sure that children’s placements in respondents have been complicated.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves unpapered immigrants and they feared compromising their own chance of staying in the country by rescuing a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no legal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or their family members are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Albence.
In order to address the case of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed uneligible will be expelled promptly.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted in recent months by the shelters network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large facility such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many struggle to manage.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been taken from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-ravaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the spot.
Moualem said about refugees that the conditions were favorable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that have deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union said there would be no support for Syria’s reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was concluded.
UN diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has made progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem emphasized, however, that the agreement provided for "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military measures would target jihadists, particularly Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and "will be eliminated."
U.N. representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee gathering members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the group’s work should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and made a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers doubtless hope, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would probably be “the most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour odds have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at high-speed hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show", which reaches 3.5 million viewers at high-speed evenings, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a matter that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor,” who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comic writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a few irrefutable truths about sliding into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He replied, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, Washington’s scenario could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds oneself watching for six hours a panel of experts debating how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear," on the description of Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket ("a clothing full of pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If some of what he’s doing makes it feel like he’s watching a reality TV show, it’s because it makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and daily situation shifts (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong).
We can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise we're late.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the northern bank of Kauai, but he was landing inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to confront the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were animating all these crazy broadcasts and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside invades the tightest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania was flooded with silver, thanks to a re-adjustment of Congressional districts that allowed two holders to compete on the same seat.
This recently restructured Pittsburgh suburb district is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another electoral district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb meets another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th District has given rise to a confrontation regarding the financing of election campaigns between major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won on accuracy last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district victory by 20 points.
Politicians gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then retreated
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little opposed.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to summon heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control drugs and provide developmental and economic support.
The planned sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three US envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton in the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible impediment to justice. The public file is now backed by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also focus his investigation on the question of a connivence of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congressional control changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself under an obligation to be accountable to that body as he prepares to stand before the voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “yes,” and I do not claim that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held him up and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divides and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divides.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump for accountability?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this heritage as a legacy, I cannot be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to make exploits.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking of getting something and left with a point.
We might have been able to win at the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough match because they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I’m sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph.”
Women can no longer find sleep because of fear about their retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey knew clearly how they wanted to be taken care of them, few people talked about the issue with their family members.
Almost half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what’s needed to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a rescue-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or other insurance on your wealth - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Provide a health care authority that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and take care of paying your invoices if you are incapacitated.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just finances at stake, but who are the doctors as well?” Martin asked.
“What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?

Man injured several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while walking home from a night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time she was shot in her chest, belly and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the score is expected to be heavy.
As the communications were paralyzed, rescue services were unable to receive any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that runs along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and in particular of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing 226,000 casualties on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shake the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Serious earthquakes shake the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, in violation of a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a statement released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su pretrial detention centre and is detained on a $500 unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, it’s sure” when his advocacy was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to imprisonment of up to one year and is fined $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a class B minor offence, punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is ongoing before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed that he struck her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behaviour to the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died from the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the number of victims is expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake declared itself just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, running on his pedestrian and a cyclist road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will be required to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intention to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "minimum preparation and premeditation," the prosecutors said, calling Saipov's method "odicious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The southern district of New York had not claimed the death penalty as part of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and spying for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was induced to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea for guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma related to these events for all interested parties,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of eurosceptics – as one of May’s MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative back-ban MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been released” if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of remaining in the Union who have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its program and “chaos.”
Bone told the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and have been entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already been out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not engaged in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who supported the exit, was also present at the march to tell the journalists: “I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honor their promises.”
Mr. Farage told the gathering that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was made during the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to deceive Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We won’t let you get out of it like that.”
He added in an enthusiastic message to the crowd: “I wish you felt the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour gathering in downtown.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives because of the security issues concerning the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
Good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running for presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for presidential elections after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice toward President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intends to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state.
Louisiana State University's Sims Shooting Death Arrest
On Saturday, Louisiana’s Baton Rouge police announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the gunshot death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service was involved in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man on the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot injury in the head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to finding himself on the spot, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of them as starting last season, and totaled an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads toward world title after team guidelines allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and dropped Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands a late lap and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inner part at risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speeding arrival and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to get a two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “evil, disgusting, and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening these last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the disclosures and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose some information-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t disclose anything.”
Well, wait a moment.
We have disclosed information... No, we haven’t disclosed any information,” he added, thinking of the Senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me.”
But his denial doesn’t seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’m going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars deleted their defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the 5-3 return game to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the edge back.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen set two goals, ensuring them the victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being picked up.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, with the Giants triumphant in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the edge in the fourth minute at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered Cownie's service at 15:16 with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants ahead of the first break when he hit his second goal from the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee at the forefront for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus securing victory to his team by scoring a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are reported missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the area and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he felt it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken from learning that,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet would continue to grow as many bodies were still under rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters devastated Palu, which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now declares that a man disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew evacuated the plane that was flowing safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact unfolding of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slide into the water to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He claimed that the on-board officers had panicked and screamed, and that he suffered from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people onto land before the plane sinks in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerning Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The indictment postponed his file on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to meet his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' SMS, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense should begin its advocacy on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury over the course of the day.
The High Breed: What Is Political Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York Nanny Prosecutes Couple for Firming Him After 'Racistic' Message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistaken message from the mother complaining that she was “still a black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and assimilates prosecution to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dismay when she found in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, having understood her "uncomfortable", Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, explaining to her that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day of work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is prosecuting the couple in order to obtain compensation for her dismissal and claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was originally hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she explained to the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing not to be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you’ve been rude with, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let’s see!”
Similaring the trial to “extortion,” Plasco said that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the public court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a little teddy bear, would remain optimistic about rejecting her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' release had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after her death last year.
She described Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was quite a calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds in something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was urgently taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect it to get out of it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt that immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Women in mourning lay down postcards to prevent suicide on bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he left his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid that there will be a training effect.”
Mrs. Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt shooted, depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas day - when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: "It's tearing up for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins his investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking – a time-limited investigation, limited in its scope – we might be able to bring a bit of unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” in a partisan impasse.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, or November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans score badly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to make the man they want to elect to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to separate the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters ‘fall’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strengthened border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs claimed by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of Northern deserters will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of discussions focused on the denuclearization negotiations that were still pending.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, they would have called her “hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied, with emotion, the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting in the committee, calling the allegations concerning him a “grotesco and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the court where he is currently,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible overthrow of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And women must use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a frame somewhere who told me she was crying when she was getting angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was getting angry and crying, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an excavator to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a man-dominated office, where I one day found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was that I was caught by the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always frightened me - who took me up a staircase.
“Don’t let them in any case see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and happy because they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic MP, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a thoroughly thoughtful decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in fundraising, so it swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she felt dull.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit in Beijing
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war have been stunning, and although the battle is far from ending, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, striking recently 5% to 10% tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equal the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will waver soon.
Putting Washington back is giving in to demands, but publicly giving in to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive long-term effect on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could establish conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have acknowledged before,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is “prepared” for refugees’ return, Foreign Minister says
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional or aid from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5-point bar needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, plunged his start into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5 to 4 by the European team's lowest-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in his career in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We’re going to get together, I’m going to work with America’s PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow down.
We have been exceeded.”
Point info on the red tide: Lower concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which fears declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from the north of Pinellas to the south of the counties of Lee.
Islets are found about 16 km (10 miles) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, high average concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations at the bottom of Lee County and offshore.
Respiratory irritation persists in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwestern Florida over the past week.
