Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the release of the minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a disadvantaged deal with Russia for Ukraine on purchasing natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for their approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is about clarifying whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in some ways.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off their hands.
Women can already forget emancipation and apostates waiting for execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it was probably not suitable for the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is that it is still surprising that Islamic fighters thankfully accepted the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When you are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
Following the recent poor experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "cruises"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia don't come across us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for investor seekers
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stalled, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew 0.5%, France's 0.4%
Both countries have made public data for the second quarter, in Germany it improved more than expected (0.3% growth rather than expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight 0.1% reduction (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSÚ the trend to gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but it has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% annually.
The interest on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation begins to affect also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although in the area the situation is getting worse.
In Germany, voices arise that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are qualified for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the ranking with a 200 million premium.
The soccer team fulfils the toughest task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to excellent Čech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, he won the victory by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, defended itself fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the game’s development in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent Čech game and heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not push until the second half.
The two injured in the party were Damjanović and Vučinič, who missed two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven won’t miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the national football coffers will receive an approximate reward of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were only committed to keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, precisely what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon on Tuesday before the premises and then chorused slogans of death to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli sources said it would reach not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner
More than one-third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity affects 5%.
Most obese children proceed from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment in which it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessive children feed, for example, on candy at least twice as frequently as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had dinnered chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no custom of sporting, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same nearly 900 children of basic education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the “Obesity is not a coincidence” program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Adequate diet and enough family exercise are decisive factors, which make the number of overweight and even obesity children decrease significantly.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals daily according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, meal, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey’s results said.
No breakfast but with dinner buffet
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households there is nothing to eat.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children insane fried potatoes are consumed much more often.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet soft drinks (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the selected boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal.”
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
"It is above all alarming the popularity of sweet soft drinks," the study's final report warns.
As the main meal, the palm takes the pasta and follows the bird meat closely.
Practically, children always reject the legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
“In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study’s results pointed out.
Attracts attention, for example, to sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more frequently choose poultry and fish for the main meal on the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue.
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the branch, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that is the vast majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, elongate a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dressing her in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or pants don’t fit, it’s worth stitching at least one extra piece of tailor-made fabric.
They will certainly not regret, because the clothing that feels perfectly is priceless.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that doesn’t stop moving, rising, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly a lot of different kinds of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the assigned task, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom they must design two wardrobes: one for the day and one for the night.
Consider the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it’s a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately has gained a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut dresses from magazines or search them on the internet and print them, and then graphically elaborate them.
The moodboard, which is as it is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not only wear physically, but also takes care, for example, of the product pages in magazines (concrete topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about all of this.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists animated Saturday’s conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
Designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in various ways.
Variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a garment (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classically with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just pick it up and raise your neck to get a totally different picture.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: “To start working, you need to know all the rules first.”
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it becomes clear why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), you have to be ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition, the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all different from those worn in reality.
All this needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style represent alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketer have made her a world star.
In Czechia, at the moment, there is no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance doesn’t matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a very different size from the actual one (small).
Then it only remains to gogle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fatted/slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to be oriented in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, you must communicate with the people you’ve seen, so it’s essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her clothes room and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t grab and throw away everything there was and say, ‘Huy what horror’.”
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend for someone to put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the workforce.
It is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, scissors, or unmissable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clothing clamps in front, if it was larger (pins and other types of clamps are not allowed, as they could damage a fabric),
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but clothing and clothing.
We couldn’t touch the shoes with the scissors so we didn’t accidentally hurt them.
So I had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don’t get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a pink path, but I don’t care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is competing all over America.
Reviews
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of inappropriate neglects for a routine trip during tomorrow’s shift.
To some extent, expectations have been met, but this is of no use, if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new release, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
It promised it would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that shouldn’t end up being an action genre again.
We are also curious about how the scenes would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much over what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total computing points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, errors can not be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible mistake of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
He introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous series deliveries.
Therefore, it is nothing from the other world.
But the desert ride, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, you must be careful not to be buried by an avalanche in the mountains.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (classic timed duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes appears the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are a lot less landscapes in the game than you might expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the above-mentioned context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer much, but it cannot be claimed to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can now search elsewhere.
But a race conceived with a lot of action suits this driving style quite well, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
Until here, everything in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the right of driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games of this kind you cannot expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that when making a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouets.
Or even it is completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can get you in a bad mood.
Resets are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
In each race, however, only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something doesn’t go well, but it’s not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, not even resetting helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes it rage especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances smoothly, but when you arrive, you must either turn or brake.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
Adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always ahead of you in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front, so at first you can brush the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it’s a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that it doesn’t catch the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during racing.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because precisely there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
On reaching the upper level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes available other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you get to run in the dark through the lanes (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you comes the metro convoy and is taken ahead without more.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the game programming none even thought a little or whether the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even proud.
It is a shame that, in the most tense moments, the quality of the image is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects mostly accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of tastes.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game for his music alone.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely foolish errors, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because errors will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová started her conference at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take his motto “clear and openly about Europe” seriously, which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U.C. Law School.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new permanent chairman of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“The first thing that comes from criticism is that if he is insult, a gray official, able to take on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles perfectly.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new position as a representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is an important step towards unifying and clarifying the political union for States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good turmoil", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the seven-year EU budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which will receive the least? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly."
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, alienisms or jargons that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the cucumbers are not really invented, the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative rather than the positive.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is due to many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivating messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, have you already left, those of the Visegrad Group?’ and it seems that it doesn’t make any fun to him.”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits new very tough budget policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new one of the "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the reinforced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, stay away.”
“These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the Europe of the two speeds,” Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed between the member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great accuracy, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-term figure was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world can be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous move towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Already in the 1930s, Watson was concerned with the care of his employees as the employer of Baťa in Czechia (IBM employees were among the first U.S. operators to enjoy paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the very beginning, the company was able to discover talent (being one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, with which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
During the last few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, as nearly half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company,” says Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM – or the “Green” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world over the past hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the highest number of patents from all U.S. tech companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include the ATM, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and diskettes.
This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not wager on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t get anchored emotionally in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this is the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the Future
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily dedicated to services, about one fifth of which are programs and another fifth of equipment.
Even in 1990, however, the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers’ share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion, investing $58 billion in future technology purchases.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29th increased investments.
So far, it seems that IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has continued to increase.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 – it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It possessed inventions such as the famous "log-in clock", which allows to control the entrance and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory board.
Flint appointed the head of a competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to assist him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of appliances for business, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and began the company’s great expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years occupying the boss' chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peces", which established the computer standard of that time, came on the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its goal is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM introduced not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner,” Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová received Bartošové in her house during the summer, she couldn’t even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>íčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even stated publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our home, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my beloved old donkey who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtářová said, adding that he had already unhooked her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Josef doesn’t care if a woman has closed her back door.
“I accept my wife’s decision.”
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company remains in force, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility,” concludes Josef.
The Worst Vices of Women: Do They Mean You Also?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are quoted that manage to boil the blood to men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one bag a week?
Do you like buying at retailers often?
So in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk through the clothing shops, look for well-fitted garments and then try them all at the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I would need to lose weight at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Didn't these sentences sound to you?
What do you mean?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to their partner complaining all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite jungle.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stopping your clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that it was so hard for you to clean?
In case you suffer this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not be primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleansing could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The worn trousers are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks too tomorrow."
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometers to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will be able to get him out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, wouldn’t make so many comments.
Slanders and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes gets out of a small, harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is proper to almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossip women of those who are uncontrolled, who love to gossip and often do so, they despise everyone and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assists to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old’s play, and took a step further and was declared the game’s best player.
Two assists were awarded in the game and Jágr’s partner Jakub Voráček was also awarded.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the match I told him I would triple.”
"I introduced him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first Flyers trail.
A little later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček took the disc behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who set a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot collapsed through Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly among the top three," Jágr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
“I’m very pleased with it.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my peers were playing for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, from penalty, until set a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up out in number two to one.
“Pronger had a good performance in our field.”
"He cleared the disc, I took speed and Read went to the farthest side."
"I tried to get him to the record and I'm happy that I got it," said Voráček, the last goal of the game as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead of the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury to the upper body.
The Canadians lost not only a player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels.”
“At last, but it’s that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“So much turning the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
“We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field.”
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus put an end to a series of losses that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time in most cases sold travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after that the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and Czech tourist travel was then quite restricted.
A major paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered travel to the West at that time, but one had to get in the queue with a sleeping bag and spend the night, or have "good acquaintances" with the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without the guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czechs’ way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the vacation in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, that the currently favoured destination, Croatia, was not allowed to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waiver was imposed to travel to Western European neighboring states, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs, for a long time, didn’t look tired of the west excursions, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was that they took food (conserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in travel demand.
With the rise in travel demand, agencies started regularly from 1997 to prepare trips using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of getting discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit nearly 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech krones per head on travel abroad, including expenses at the place of stay.
Convocated Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up again in a dead end.
Czech football has been without president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the rules of voting to follow.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June without first summoning his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a controversy unleashed between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when he had to be elected the new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not only with regard to the method of election.
There was no consensus on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment onwards, and due to this one point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes about the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation was no longer able to shed even the Executive Committee that, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has already changed a couple of times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead end?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Region of Moravia is willing to reach a compromise so that that candidate can win with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with that, although the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be better suited to Pelta.
“I would like to vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
"So that no foolishness is invented about the representatives like at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first runs as a candidate and directs his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk it will be decided on the new president and he believes the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be calmed down with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will again be the main protagonist, and so you will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope we will reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“This is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
“Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sports (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will struggle to reach the presidency because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen footballers, Tomáš Paclik, knew before the Extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he wouldn’t even stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there were a suitable person, I would be fighting for it and I wouldn't stand as a candidate for the election."
"But until today we haven't been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also pointed out that, in case of winning, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already spoken to some people I could consider.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say they don’t even want to identify with Czech football right now.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What is allegedly most annoying to Paclík right now is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit,” Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a phone hearing during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that "would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became president."
In case of winning Thursday’s election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine it, for example, as the chief of representation.”
"but not as an association manager."
“I don’t even put my noses where I feel unable,” added Paclík, who in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Referee Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits he would dare to manage the association.
He resorts to his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice.”
“To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which likely tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the lottery tax sport.
“It’s one of the key issues the new president should deal with.”
“If they raised gambling taxes, as political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically giving my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then returning there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election deadline.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, it would ensure that the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitively serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding electoral regulations.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move forward towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the unchecked elections in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas about the management of football.
“People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president this Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who primarily partners with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on Sparta and on the association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections lies the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as an attraction to win the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm ready to respond in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to get in with his opponents.
He had already warned in the past that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It has been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
“It’s been more than a year in the football world, and it’s already achieved some successes.”
“Their attacks were embarrassing and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign.”
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the superiors.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
“I would also try to fix all the scandals that arose as a result of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“It would immediately involve me in negotiations with the public and private sector, to make sure there is enough money for the whole football,” the 46-year-old told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal change to the staff.
"It would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, a comprehensible nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the upcoming general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will definitely manage to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with eagerness.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association in the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make executive committee members accountable for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national teams, through professional football or training for young high-performance footballers.”
“With this I don’t mean I would do everything alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competences in such a way that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.”
“A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not presenting himself again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me that will stop and hinder me at every step,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so as not to give up like this, just like that,” he said.
They say he is also motivated to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
During those two years, a large part of the work was finished that I don’t want it to be lost now.”
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I wouldn't want anyone to stop them," he said, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back as it was before Hašek's time.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few chosen.”
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favor of someone else."
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel good, not just the elect,” Rajchl said.
He also rejected the idea that only the president would be Bohemian.
“Although some people try to claim the opposite, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another, whose winners would go to the first division.”
“The current situation in which we have only three teams from Moravia would not be given, which represents a problem for young Moravian players,” said Rajchl.
Though the presidential election fight was joined by Tomáš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which chose me as its vice president and knows that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And as he proclaims that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
“If he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of committees.”
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he assesses his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, looking at the artistic dome high up, swimming towards the marble angelots, which awaited her at the edge of the pool, and marveling at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bath culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom enthusiasts have to content themselves with blue tiles and chlorine smell, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful trinity of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” she says.
"I started collecting beautiful swimming pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Swimming in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because they serve all senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor swimming pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
“On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything is optically folded: high vaults, colorful tiles, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly gives a desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the swimming pool collector discovers the specimens highlighted in her research in Hungary.
Adjacent to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the nitrate waters are located in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as the thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városó Termo) in Já.
Many uncovered swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the rooftop swimming pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anthony, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains steam rises in winter, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the swimming pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in her search for nice places for bathing, when she wanted to visit uncovered swimming pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she encountered a locked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsing windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
The decline counteracted in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; you can not only discover neo-Romanic elements from the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab Alhambra style hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bath of swimming pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce its agricultural raw materials business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
To citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up, and banks carry responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate’s campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials bets were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have disengaged from bids and demands, and draw profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: he promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be submitted to the Deutsche Bank’s directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
By the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting at rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare.”
Ackermann stands as the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food pricing betting,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will change something different from the unplanned in the board.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect his image.
And you need as little as possible losses to care for, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments to bet on food prices.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture passionates, clear shapes, glass halls, courageous curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating construction of steel and glass.
To this day, construction is considered a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the appropriate spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly decaying.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a hit of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater in her youth, later at Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the same name foundation are exhibited, there should be a coffee shop and a library and also an office building to be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded him and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", where he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the nearly new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany shades and protected against rust.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked to the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the city's history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness."
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a blow of urban luck. The totally new and planned "Central Station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, since collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package of millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid winter train crashes.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train breakdowns and delays, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the investments planned until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For this, better availability of vehicles and the rail network must be achieved even with extreme weather.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to double to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and runways.
The goal is to clean snow and ice runways for operation and 90 percent of needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of crashes and delays in trains also this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transportation of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years on checking the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a breakage of an axis at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fines in the U.S.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks into the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions of people.
The agreements currently concluded are its first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage bonds, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or punish faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of lawsuits.
It challenges the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business at a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also Deutsche Bank has a FHFA lawsuit, which is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, is investing strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the big American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or IT as the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his view on investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM offers primarily services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently revealed at CNBC that he has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investments have thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hasn’t known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that took care of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors from around the world.
His fast and infallible sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM stocks on the stock exchange rose one percent.
“The blue giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the rule of law in Germany.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that is reviving again.
The killings of eight small-scale Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and among the German population of Turkish origin there has been a reaction with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought to be dead a long time ago, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-rightist network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Does bloody ideology revive again?", the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" titled.
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary highlights that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant from the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, this weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn event on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was set on stage with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a stroke: "The German Gift for the Fifty Anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" does not insist on tracing this mental connection either.
"It begins to smell badly," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made a significant contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, police behaviour and its subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities did not search for suspects long before in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are the less rhetorical about the drastic media: “From now on it is lost, immigrants have nothing but self-defense and weaponry.”
“This will be the best self-protection.”
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the penalty to the entire network," he wrote.
Which means that, if Germany’s internal peace is at risk, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
Following the fire-shaped attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
Current Turkish media information again shows how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin has since been in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich Lake scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
He is now run by a German.
I’m sure Axel Weber didn’t think about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank’s summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the board of directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly observations about its future colleagues.
“The USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all of the bank’s security systems and frauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, managing director of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board of directors has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked, “When does Axel Weber arrive?”
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation certainly necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just again proven that it deserves the title “Europe’s biggest bank of scandal” for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest property manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slided from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved from the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreet and solid, but also handsome, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent banking professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders, ‘How could I be wrong?’
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came out that something went very wrong with the USB.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffli, managing director, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk bonds and had to amortize billions.
To charge this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some would look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 at Switzerland's second best-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became the co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it housed such large banks.
Ultimately, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic results (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax conflict with America and was willing to deliver data from wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a $780 billion figure, reimbursing unjustified benefits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to helping in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' funds.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through misspeculation and in property administration through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator frauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was going wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case, it is clear that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls."
Thus arose the idea of precaution, with which Swiss bankers had been presenting themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the world’s biggest assets: no too great risk, instead, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you find jewelry shops like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse Palace, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception room is entered by a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are coated in marble, in front there are large leather armchairs, next to the bench logo there is a large sign to indicate "safety".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both large banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been used to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was obvious.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in its nation's history," writes author Lukas Heiß in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they think?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for smaller Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different UBS precursor banks to complement each other: a wealthy but sleeping bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could ride a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Clearly, the insensitivity came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the chief of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Getting Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading it was at the highest.
However, the advisers of commissioned companies highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost costs it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It turned into a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the downhill for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS positions have become projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a big bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, in front of which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, to put an end to investment banking, to focus on property management, to return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go so far (still).
But investment banking needs to decrease a lot, it is clear now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must run UBS business permanently, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Deleted 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Hey, who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is currently sure to ask.
So far he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors earlier this week.

Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, just confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws out a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. technology sector.

Smart grades spread in cities
In many places, grays are considered "problem birds": these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the grays belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated for the dirt and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against "problem birds" so far.
Grays no longer leave cities, say experts at the first grays symposium in Leer, East Friesland.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grays; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The grays are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district’s graces jumped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have described the hunting of animals through bird traps and the murder with sticks as especially brutal.
“By expelling and evicting them normally, nothing is achieved,” said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscape designer at Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals divert, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
It is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of evicting animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against treating animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can endure a peak in the face with aplomo."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the grays of Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
In the meantime, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism for the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, grays not only take advantage of resources to access bits of shale, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grays how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall onto the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning fat had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the tube shooter.
Three of the four grays got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at the 2012 Euro Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Euro 2012 tickets in the play-offs in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way match, made the five consecutive Euro Championships.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off back game with outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way game (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let him score 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other Portugal goals.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African World Cup play-offs.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free from more than 30 meters to get headed at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her talents to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn’t luck in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
Former Wolfsburg team player, England's Manchester City leader sent a head blow to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit the Czech Republic
Then the collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European deputy champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own door (9.) with a reflection.
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front turn, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper of the world-famous goalkeeper, FC Seoul’s forward escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks didn’t move from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat in the 2002 World Cup third-party bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole, and attacker Kazim Kazim was not able to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia took over more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him go any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62th minute took place of Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaires of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first Euro Cup participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, who triumphed 4-0 in the one-way game prepared for a previous decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane had his first great chance.
From the beginning, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story about World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to his feet.
Here are some action tips: gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in the novel narrative of Mr. Englund, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but “a book about how it happened,” it’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and states of mood.”
The beauty and pain of the battle combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative officers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that the First World War was only the devastating trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" expertly moves through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intangible problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that smells like cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the open sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and managing what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
Continue talking about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wood soles."
There are, notes, "837 permissible meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own urge toward savagery and expresses about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in chairs with a cigar and whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and tacked breast."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once one surrenders to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to “a condemned being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer in good-made clothes who executes his slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a veneral disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal puss, which soldiers buy and batter with it their genitals in the hope of ending in the hospital,” he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to lifelong blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No Novelty on Erich Maria Remarque's front, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I'm not going to reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a flare.
After a previous false step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence highlighted how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper on protesters, violating the department’s rules and creating a public storm of sympathy towards the “okupas.”
The police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training – counter-terrorist measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," someone familiar with the orders said, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
“To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren’t told it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” the person, who spoke anonymously, said.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers sought to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged earlier after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going out of the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there was the least number of people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages buzzing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said attempts were made to prevent them from seeing police enter into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense swamp of personal items of the protesters, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags filled with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to methodically arrest them.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were candled between them by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency officers were called to cut the lock.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "alteration of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the department chief, the top officer in uniform in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, “was not running the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the latest weapon available to the union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees among the city’s lowest-paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow the city to access a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June.
A council member counter-attacked him telling him that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school’s support staff would be fired.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in poor-area schools in the city to support an unfair treatment claim, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been insufficiently chronicly subsidized.
It is noted that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in Southern Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.S. District 36 budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more often describes the act of moving a teacher from the payroll from a school to a job bag, whose salaries are paid by the headquarters.
“Sixty-six parents coordinators were fired,” the complaint draft says, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that ultimately Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the Libyan uprising.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and murdered, and the involvement of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Massachusetts Democrat), along with Senators John McCain (Arizona Republican) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut independent), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "courage."
“This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans by starting to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to pass or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually rip the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's lead Republican.
Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic that in fact achieves a vote by the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have not succeeded so far in sending their amendments to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced to this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations in each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors – especially new Republicans seeking to refine their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been about proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111st Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 at the 110th Congress.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn’t have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
Beaten but not defeated, Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him burning in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway melody "The Sun will rise tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Okay.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special show, which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords’ recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband animates her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to do simple actions.
A head movement.
A frustration of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "tostada", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: Congresswoman is seen singing with the therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who runs two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly drugged while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I have been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
The troops make you feel more pity than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of an orphaned child," the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has seized the military and a often distant, sometimes adoring, American audience.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart to Afghanistan, said.
“But it seems that the only way some can show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger facing the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most talks about pity are conducted in silence and private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an angry and violent veteran under the surface, Cancian said, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to cope with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of suffering of a service member.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to the rape.
Otherwise, hundreds of complainants are organizing for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a packet of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left aside her worry.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within a few minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to the army's major flat, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a structure from top to bottom,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for the damages suffered by the staff in active service.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are ongoing, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit organization is putting up a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of “personality disorder” assigned to victims of rape in order to give them discharge from service – a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women’s Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine bills have been submitted separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the aggressions are noticeably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which amount to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army went to trial — half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor—from a cut in her arm—was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked whether he had had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was put into the psychiatry unit, and when I came out, I remember I told my command officer, "That wasn't his judgment, that was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was waived from service under less than honorable terms, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability poses.
And he adds, “The odds are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go on his way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform takes place,” he says.
“Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a slaughter in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study center.
Facebook’s personal information clutch is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy – the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving on Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way to do an investigation,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not quite surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
Demos’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “Likes”, wall messages and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a boom in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s title name to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go directly to them."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who spoke about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent about the topic.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunkenness.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pinching” its own population for data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislature, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates long ago arguing that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for investigation).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"When it came to them, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research item is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social – and a lot of social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights,” he said in front of a full room of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “I didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from access to media for four weeks, and said authorities would need to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was held in the lock.
All attended with the goal of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," an Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," a relative of a victim said.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, Shown at a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the technology genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has dusted as the advancement of a series of special projections in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonk of flow charts - a man who believed many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawns of the personal computer, and sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, it had been just 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly re-published archive material is the foundation of Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-minute interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it went and did.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs detailed his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Confused by the way the costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was done at good eye, and then adjusted to a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine business costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and you were shouting over the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone at the next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing—it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking for talk to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the U.S. diplomat, the two broke out just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, to hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phonebook and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, I was the only company I’ve seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well their employees were treated.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improving innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, a customer asked him if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with just 30 credit days, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, remember the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... they screamed to me that it would take me five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large companies losing strength:
Long before leading Apple’s rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Tell me you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making better photocopiers and printers, and what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
The sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running the companies and people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary craft.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s.
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all goes down to taste – it goes down to trying to expose you to the best a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were accidentally the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner With Health Care Law Rivals While Court Accepts Case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the defiance of President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to carefully study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states defying the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to proceeding and, in fact, a historical claim of five-and-a-half hours is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further turbulent the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full peak at the time the court’s decision becomes known.
The attorney who will appear in court and claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been devoted to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary court hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it’s not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which states: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honor guest, or appear on the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that the court follows by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, Common Cause president.
"The judges were gathered in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that say they too easily mix court activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as for now to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 dual-corridor aircraft, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It’s rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big transaction when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 aircraft reaches a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 dual corridor jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011.
Then, Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sales price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these clients in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with rising oil prices.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-fuselage aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft ahead.
Boeing’s victory at the air fair comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more boost after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president’s sister, apparently defeated in Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the battle for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her nomination as governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped lean the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state governor race to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they seized the polls, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed by little margin Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, ranked third, a big defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A mayor of the PAN was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning by Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in view of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to prevent a long-term recession that would hinder the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the two world’s fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the recovery of the economic block either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe's difficulties in a "imparcial" way and said Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
“We are all together in this.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it cannot be immune."
“So if China and India can help, let it be by any means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the drop in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“Sometime they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t fit well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector in jobs of poorly managed companies and loss-generating companies such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with “important chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “down-risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chained financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digging $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now it fears a further cut of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a stop to many new projects.
“A huge cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed – you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good willingness.”
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime financing in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The hiring of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war.”
“Wage personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result that one can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of U.S. national security, and it should not be allowed to occur.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though he came to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers low morality, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites to aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A glance at the latest headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “pilled” with an open microphone stating to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Liing has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made ridicule with his denying quickly rejected by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding offences related to cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton as he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps at school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
Many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers were lying three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or “localization of lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lies have been rebated.
Liars look in the eyes.
They do not always mutter, buzz, blow or rest.
Neither can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmaske.
A trained lies detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question-forming, and times.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries on deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "other-oriented lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies that they usually say tend to be "normal").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes afterwards.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It’s best you know if someone normally hits with the foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see him beating his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and nonverbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who deceive can freeze the upper body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview drowning" -- that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely show that the interview has ended just to seek that relief post-interview.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her nationally.
People who deceive can also use a distancer language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be true... even as far as I know... to myself."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Diverted After Threat of U.S. Delay in Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraging trade unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company looking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said on Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department’s announcement last week that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied to avoid the areas of Nebraska’s Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
“This is a real path of progress,” Nebraska Republican representative Lee Terry told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a remoteness from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the diva of disc music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, frightening her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
"Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when plotter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone approached from behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to catch her,' he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He was angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
I had a bottle of water and started to throw the water out of the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” said the mother of the girl.
LaBelle struck over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and withdrawn from a car that was waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle’s representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressed to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old boy in her arms.”
Climate adversity halts the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa has increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated change, which generated great expectations regarding advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, however, a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is recorded.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing million-dollar losses for the agriculture sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a shrinking of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damages, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of crops were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops sinistered were those of vegetables, corn and chicken.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment was increased in the first three quarters of the year from a 1,000 to a 5,000 percent increased in the first quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction legislation passed at the Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illicitly it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes noted that in the rise in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entering, and second because entering already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, those people are staying and are demanding work sources here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is exacerbated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are the low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Signal workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Alongside the decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June, the state FDI amounted to $630,000,697, representing a decline of 87.74 percent from the $5 billion, $143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the government of the state requested in July the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the debt in any sector.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’ government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 it lacked the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the government of the state itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to regain the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we lacked alignment of everyone’s effort and above all the already synchronized good run of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better.”
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events such as early-year frosts stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had.”
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it was required to encourage the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which to redefine the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has be detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a forward-looking vision that better addresses the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different areas, there are some progress in economic development but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in conducting public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A Navolato neighbor was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the narcomenudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by members of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcotician was driving in a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag on the vehicle’s box and in the co-pilot’s seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced continues internally at the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
must contribute to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk as the Government of the State has failed to comply with the contributions corresponding to it, which adds to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programs is nearly 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent correspond to the State and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in effect.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute the state administration at that time.
“It happened to us in the previous sixth century because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to go, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending,” he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them reach as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the House of Deputies raised against the presidential decree advancing the so-called “analog blackout” from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including Court President Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concretize the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand filed by the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the draft arguments, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also don't think that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, encompassing a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data thrown by the PREP the difference between first and second places of the election of governor is just 27 percent, yet not counted the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as regards this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data thrown by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second places of the election of governor is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 total records.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not approve his Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the deadlines provided in the Law of the Official Journal of the State.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called "invalid and illegal" the state president's vote on constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in cases where: the results of the records do not match; there is no scrutiny and computation record in the file of the box or not in the possession of the president of the box; or where there are obvious errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total counting of the vote received in all election boxes may be made when there is indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the candidate who won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the party representative and/or the second coalition that postulated.
The total counting of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary counting, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed, in which case electoral packages that have been the subject of partial counting will be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé saw, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday night, recognitions and a requiem mass were conducted.
According to his relatives, the Lieutenant Colonel's last will was that his ashes were scattered in the Zapalinamé saw.
After receiving a tribute from the side of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes arrived at the sailing chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 in the afternoon, he was awarded a recognition at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues from the technological bachelor’s and football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his bachelor’s preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered in the Zapalinamé saw, he always expressed this to his family and friends," this made known to him Sandra Bacio Cortés sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considering that he was in the fullness of his life, "was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and at the penchant of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe him because they said he was even dizzying in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for his family graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he most liked in life: flying an aircraft.
Give him the last farewell
With honors was fired Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, who gave him the people and government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, managers and students of the Saltillo Tecnológico, where he studied in 1985.

Three abandoned bodies in Cadereyta NL
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented 11 people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime to the media.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot of grace, on an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding happened on the 1.5 kilometer of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, was the open gate pair to pair.
Looking inward, about three meters away, they spotted the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow dress with dark-mixed pants, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strap dress.
A few meters away was the body of another individual wearing red suit and blue-mixed pants.
All three were face down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people would have been murdered elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth are appreciated legends that go from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured 11 in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretariat presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Cadereyta and who were related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first event on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros eight people were detained and one who was deprived of his liberty was rescued.
They were secured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event on November 12 at 6 a.m., military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the town of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without signs and with two subjects on board.
By marking them up and performing the inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president tomorrow to present the new government facing a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy’s appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government facing a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the hit trust in Italy.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti said his government should last until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the election is advanced.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but large parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrusts and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spanish is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 soccer players named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side only one of the 22 summoned came to the 50 matches.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, account for an extensive record of class A intersection games, the Tricolor only holds defender Michael Umaña as the only one to hold the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England maintain intense activity every year in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated qualifiers of the Euro and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, on the contrary, have a limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the top record of the Spanish national team is bowman Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a Barcelona brain steering wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other 100-year-olds of the Iberian team, the Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariet, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost near the hundred-year-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It follows Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Diaz, with 48 presences, and the gunman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded all 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't near 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet debuted.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records as many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintetto included the country on its two decades-long celebration tour
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to host one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be turning the dream of playing in the country into reality.
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the Angelina band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I’ve been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask you because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret it took so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
“First of all, I think none of us imagined that we would be in a big rock band and having done so for more than 20 years has made it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that big band.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it’s rare.
From time to time, a band of a city emerges, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and it honors us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care for each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do they find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without becoming capricious of being famous and a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
“There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and most importantly we’re still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
They're so many.
Among the first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that emerged at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s worth listening to music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that they qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there is some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, undoubtedly, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical exams
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his legs, his physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers several illnesses, including a cancer in the tongue for which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his view Fujimori would be a candidate to gain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It has been operated four times from tongue cancer, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms that has been added to other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Police Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squadron who clandestinely operated in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official comitiva, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican peer, Felipe Calderón, highlight of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propriety for the exchange of information in everything that are political affairs between the two nations," according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that emerged when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to streamline the creation of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), consisting of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser's claws, but never before in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to tell how the stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Nintendo’s specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, more experts will be able to take a "second lap" at the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional Super Mario raid also represents the character’s return to a portable console, a fact that hasn’t occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo sniffs the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting that the mustache plumber will have to cross hazardous platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he formalized the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy for the $70 million laundering.
Thus ended the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to trial him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term he "did not get his hands" in court decisions and formalized all the extraditions he had met.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s executive proceedings took place after all judicial and constitutional proceedings were exhausted to prosecute the former presidential officer between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the Q120 million default in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process leading up to extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation over the course of this quarter century.
This includes the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary yesterday served to make a balance in an event celebrated in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex that attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with poor training, unemployed, with dogradiction problems or in a position of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full time electoral, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education counselor, Ernest Maragall, and the current mayor and ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The large room of the Fabra i Coats also attended the current counselor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president put Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it performs,” he said.
Evicted an occupied estate where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had owned 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51.
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of the 51st street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they illegally occupied yesterday, and where they organized macrofiestas that desperated the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowd parties, which lasted up to two days and desperated tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been injured.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the estate made it unfair competition, as they sold the drinks for three euros, while at the club they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure premises had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, he pointed out, the discomfort is not caused by the clients of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the Okkupada house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The director of the club explained that the inconvenience was so great that he even reached an agreement with the property owner and nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors over the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called last week for "immediately displacement of the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had been entering all floors of the building and almost every floor, and that some have even occurred thefts.
In this regard, he added that, “it is necessary to end impunity and be strong against the incivilism that has been generated in the estate.”
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional paschins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imaginary of many, as the upper boundary of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park leads to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council convened a mega competition composed of 16 competitions for so many other gates of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes to reflect on the city, is the theme of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring theme to catch when two members of this ancient caste of elects recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, are of the opinion that they have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since Ildefons Cerdà's speech, that of the green apples, has not been held.
"It should start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "lexic trap": you must not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from how "uncertain it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that he had in the area of the Fòrum "su chant of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries on where it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its override.
“We need to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.”
More clinging to the question, Mòdol considers that, simplifying, the collserola valley side "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", by a merely topographical issue.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city hall offers to his board to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safeconduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest lacks a global view of Collserola: "There have been convened 16 transversal contests - says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, that see and understand the area as a whole".
This leads, at least if necessary, to have chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his opinion, that is, the municipality should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal seized of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmails.
After 72 days in jail, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal holder of Casino Red granted him forgiveness to the District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail proceeding against the mayor’s brother.
Following the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly required him to pay an economic fee for the regional town hall to allow the underground operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the mayor panista and on September 2 he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Officer of the Public Prosecutor 3 in Patrimonial Delicts, he was transferred to the Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
He remained in that place for the 49 days following the issue of a second warrant after the public prosecutor dismissed the crimes of counterfeiting and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an order of apprehension by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months of investigations were checked enough evidence to determine Jonas's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the betting house's representatives in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal owner, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the Mayor; so in the coming hours he could regain his liberty.
During the legal diligence, the prosecutor’s officer at the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter no claims may be filed regarding the process that followed him; in addition, no compensation for damages or punishment will be required.
After the hearing of the legal holder of the bookmaker, Larrazabal Breton was ordered to be immediately released at about 3:50 p.m.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Secretary of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more people died indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that investigations done in the impact zone did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
“In one search, there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results sooner possible; however, the investigation may last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
“This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,” he said.
At the press conference, the head of the TBS, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM placed adequate conditions for take-off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico were present cloud layers at low height.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side trajectory.
The scattering pattern of the aircraft’s debris allows to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no evidence revealed on the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above middle sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictablely disarticulated along said path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the settled site, around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Leads Social Security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescenthood', which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population, whether or not rightholders, is invited to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He emphasized that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Occidental) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico Oriental).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
At World Diabetes Day on November 14, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
On Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics are applied to all participants (the aim is to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this research obeys the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity in boys and 47 percent in girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed," the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from others in their genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translate into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: sedentaryness, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport rather than walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary beverages, carbohydrates (tails, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mix with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that send the pavement were answered, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the entire process of construction and maintenance of a pavement was adequate, even the aspth.
In his conference A technological opinion of the bumps, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has a near solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the asphalt resistance on the streets is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher noted that Mexico City’s streets are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt folder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When the vehicles are transported and the forces are generated, this allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, abundant, is placed a last layer called rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tyres of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the proper thickness and the material from which it is made should be cared.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the terrain is wet, the water is diffused inside the folder and it is difficult to leave, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bug, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle loading is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicle loading and ensure that it is met, to prevent the formation of bumps frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair bumps with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th Princess title.
Again the Valle del Cauca stays with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content herself with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (2008), where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina (1989), Catelle Gireal (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989), Ollva (1989) and Ollva (1989)
Today, the big question that many people ask is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is this book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
At the question the vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a rather profound book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that he didn’t like first for the term “culturalizing” and second for not explaining concretely how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public’s vote for the best craftsmanship costume, and Queen Madre), “this awoke the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage.”
And that was noticed in her first show in swimsuits on the Hilton Beach and her two parades on the coronation evening.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN Channel's "Come at Home" show, said that Melina's designation as Princess "verifies that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not remain as a queen."
Moreover, Valle showed himself to the last very escape with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
Two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, which before joining the contest are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth was not very notorious to me, dropped her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her strength and here she was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time awarded the National Beauty Competition, after the show in swimsuit a cruel prediction arose that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina starts a year of reign from today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international certamen by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, avoided her crown.
This was the work of the caleno who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali's lophoscope went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a Cali's CTI lophoscope went to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the analysis of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the frictional skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alfonso Cano to Eliazar was warned that he should wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was heading to the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decady card of Guillermo León Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team to the site where the corpse was found, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was indeed the top leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present fake bills or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and search for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was his time to remove a piece of wall from a house, because at that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Footprints may also dismiss or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, he does place him on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprinter at the CTI explained that in the objects "the footprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them up.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective measurement is performed.
The “indignated” challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large portion attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the background of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and trying to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the “indignated” to camp again on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp again in the square, we’re going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations,” said one of the spokespersons for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the “indignated” response to the eviction from his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignated" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti square – which is a privately owned enclosure – remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of that court order at this time and even handing them over to the officers who guarded the square, causing “some small clashes,” Bray said, who reported that some officers were beating the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The ruler personally defended the early morning eviction from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were carried out and that was decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave orders to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” as “some businesses had been threatened” and neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
“The eviction this morning was disgusting and demonstrates that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” said the movement’s spokesman, who accused the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
"Occupy Wall Street" officials also said they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two-month protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", rescuer on "Baywatch", rabbit of "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, bringing to life a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide-ranging online distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears alongside her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll depicting Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special has Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called U.S. Kim Kardashian "shore" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe Japan has suffered since World War II.
The earliest estimates by the Government of Tokyo counted material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, appears to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of drop, the gross domestic product data between July and September served to go ahead, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest pace of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rise in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the true revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of crises to reinforce – or rebuild – infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, pushed by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “refuge values” chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and US cloudy forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen quote.
While markets continue to siege EU peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
“We must be attentive to the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed sharp signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area, even, stood below the average, which is at level 100, as it precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled 19 February.
“The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,” Papadimos said in opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the official disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still scorned by the impact caused by the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment unambiguous and as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is neither a definitive date.
The Greek meadow still has yarn for rat.
Sophia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place globally in the role of Microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this intrusion of cooperation, whose “essence” noted lies in being an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings.”
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and, "very especially, in the one whose goal is the reduction to half of the volume of people living with lower incomes."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate from the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", principal beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements achieved” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit stands not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is aspired that by the end of 2015 the millions of poor families who have accessed these financial services should be 175 and that one hundred million of those households should exceed the poverty threshold that they are plunged into.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago pioneeringly" by Muhammad Yunus, Doña Sofía emphasized as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuing evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic bounty, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredits represent “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluding who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe had initially not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants who consider the government’s policy to be too unstrict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with his speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, are summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to pave the way for Europe.”
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is undoubtedly unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Anxious to calm the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is also not that she tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leaves
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leaves.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and the assistant.
Furthermore, to accompany such an offensive, which part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leaves.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day shortage before they can take the decline.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of unpaid lack in the event of a lack of work (to date, they have no lack, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of labour losses.
“Controls will be significantly increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts,” Xavier Bertrand warned, speaking at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of labour loss fraud.
Indeed, since 2002, this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched that have normally given fruit.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
First of all, let us look closely at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006, more than 237 million euros were paid in employment benefits.
According to the French Institute of Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, in 2008, loss subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% correspond to maternity leaves and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sick leaves, which amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of disease leaves were less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbors, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to get sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leaves is not particularly significant compared to unreported work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has led to the systematic controls of sick leaves of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 conducted, that short-term leaves were "unjustified or too long", i.e., 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of cases were considered to be "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, taking as a starting point a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such practice would represent losses in tax revenues of between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion a year, i.e. more than the total cost of loss subsidies and undoubtedly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the 100 days granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
“To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the vote of confidence debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since the country's remaining in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has forecast that the country’s public deficit will decrease “up to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of further measures," he said during a meeting with deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with the goals of deficit reduction and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would sign nothing because of external pressure.
Expert committee says euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live denying death, Canadian Royal Society report says
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is still denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient considers that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To get started, experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada say.
And, although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not match the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said by teleconference yesterday that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“Euthanasy is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to relieve their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
Additionally, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have practised assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a proceeding against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it is suggested that the Criminal Code state that withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, is not a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be regarded as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally sick.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the findings of the report, which she called a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, challenges especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President El Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is becoming more isolated
Bashar El Assad’s partisans demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar al-Assad who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have protested in favour of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "abandone power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with respect to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsher stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsher tone” regarding the repression in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSHR) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, said the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country is "progressing towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his duties, which he believes is "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not faint," he added, ensuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the crackdown of the regime that, in his opinion, is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to prepare for the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which in particular provides for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League’s decision was “incorrect” yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although he did not express his support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include “sacrifices” aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated with political parties yesterday and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed President of the Council.
Chairman of the House of Representatives Gianfranco Fini said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the submission by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he stressed, adding that he "is sure that markets will have patience and understand it."
His appointment by the President initially received the favor of the markets, but then concern was raised, in particular after an unforeseen drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include "politics."
The new government is expected to function until 2013, the date of the upcoming legislation, he considers.
According to Chairman of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that when he takes over the position, he will work with regard to the urgency and with the goal that Italy "recovers its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further stricter measures.
The Italian "Chief of Bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him the mates, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot meet deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "changer of time" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The biggest unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Collaborated with Iranian Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the investigator’s identification, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "severe concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Afterwards, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear signs that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew well about the technique, but also, according to a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of its career in such technology in its home country's military nuclear program."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., it has increased by 49%, compared with a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, the FBI said.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime has risen again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said, “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and must strive to end such abuses,” he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
The legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes its service look a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another called "name" allow you to more readily and live track the activity of other "Twitters", i.e. those users whose "tweets" follows on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they classify any messages as favorites, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poorly instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the insiders, opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with different views.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” he wrote.
“The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
Introduction of a "gold rule" in the Constitution
The large social-democratic/Christian coalition government in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the Constitution a “gold rule” budgetary to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria’s sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the ceiling of 60% set by the Treaty of Maastricht, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion more euros in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Deputy Chancellor for Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an equivalent-value law.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of the change if the yen continued to rise.
“We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks produced by the Japanese authorities’ intervention on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rebounding ever since, driven by purchases from investors who regard it as a “value shelter” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned to less than 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was listed at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms exports in the archipelago, as it increases Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues earned abroad by Japanese companies when converting them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east, Noda said, fearing that the yen's rise would cut the weak recovery.
The third world economic power recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of the households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the “economic bases of Japan.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the BoJ had already taken “the right measures,” suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 trillion euros) the threshold of funds it devotes to acquiring various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags faint
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 hours, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given new tensions in relation to the loan returns of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent profits.”
“Investors, nervous, are fully aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing market players’ concerns about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a small range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to drop on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion foreseeing, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish 10-year bonds offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of choking with the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the sight of markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favorable figure than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure for the second quarter to the bottom, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is a topic that can’t be dealt with considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if you consider the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options as a whole.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are seven billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated to continue continuously produce electricity, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which aims solely to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is occasionally presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
The Berlin election will lead to a higher price of electricity, a greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
It is important to consider the case of Denmark.
The European champion in the wind sector, from which he gets 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittence of the wind; for this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would deprive realism of the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to the surveys.
Remember that our country’s energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets that can create non-relocationable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to operate for sixty years, when its manufacturer is planned to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolic source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our professional teams are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused neither consequences for people nor for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all electric actors who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free way to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate a debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped into the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "needs no foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't take over all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that the co-development will allow to solve the “migration problem.”
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms jobs.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly those with low skills, pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for domestic workers and primarily carry out occupations in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the wages and employment of nationals.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migration flows represents a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that an immigrant who arrives in Germany at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon the Little, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The pallinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
You have to think about this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a void of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effect, but a common, full-fledged, quiet and continuous exercise of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn’t know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that follows the orders of markets and rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the steering wheel of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having struggled for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and by Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But thinking about it without further political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make it European.
Cards with "no-contact" chip are generalized
The world chip card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with a 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to estimates from the cabinet Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for joint transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for about 10% of the global market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their starts are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to get the higher gear, however, it is necessary for the banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards endowed with the contactless system,” said Gérard Nébouy, managing director of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect 80 to 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Bank Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly via their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Linkages between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show they are cooperating," he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured the researchers’ interest: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we should definitely wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and the same-style suicide bombs or explosive devices used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which in the house means “Western education is a sin”) incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim part of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands a strict respect for sharia, while its militants embark on the struggle against the wicked central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were recorded.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacks Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, disturbs all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Shebab’s Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidency Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more and more stunning foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best positioned candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of his sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "sweeps" emotions.
He has called for a firm, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “trys to develop nuclear capacity,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the US army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks aren’t easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way Obama’s national security balance sheet, which killed Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is suspicious of the military interventions that cause a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership, Obama makes the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the banks of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects underwater Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year to Western Europe through a first 1,224-kilometre pipeline that connects the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 that will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already talked about the possibility of building a third tube on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land flow through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and West Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically,” confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by caution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project leaders resigned when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to permanently settle at sea off its coasts.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas passing in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted junctions that, according to the forecast, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating within the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, in charge of building and operating the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Then, Gazprom leased the company for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all gas transport capabilities.
“Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone takes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coast.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the exit gate of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italy’s borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, as the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and culted.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at its inception, now owns nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of towns, and he has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with Moleskine’s development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition “Detour” where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapes, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand encompasses a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, up from 9% for the entire population.
Disheartening?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress made for fifteen years is considerable.
At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
It should be noted that disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years of age (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished their bachelor’s degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that especially make it difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the end of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the Cité association noted that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities,” with an “excessive representation of wheelchair people, physically impaired or intellectual.”
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts paid out, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies that own between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their employment, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
Just about to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brings to them.
We will not dare to say that connivence was noticed among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forerunner's gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very glad for Eden, for its progress and for being Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," Lille's forward replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "it is a set," it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Invited to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Not to forget the “pleasure.”
He has been animating the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
Simply, Leekens has for his part made reference to "pride."
"Pride" for playing "a gala game."
"Pride" also to be verified, as "neighbor," that France "returns to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share planes with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our small Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the upcoming matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal’s Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the back game against Bosnia (22.00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way match, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; Selecçao, which he has run since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored outside the home.”
But at home, in the bright Estadio da Luz de Lisboa, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally excited, even if it becomes evident that the match "is very equal," says an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope that the game will be very matched, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor, however, has relativized.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians might get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the home," Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of, from the beginning, exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't give them time to think".
It’s a good idea, as long as this time it’s realistic.
