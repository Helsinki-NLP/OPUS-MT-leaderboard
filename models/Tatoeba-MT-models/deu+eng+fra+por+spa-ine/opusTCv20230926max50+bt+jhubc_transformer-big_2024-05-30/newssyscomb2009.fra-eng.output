Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a substantial weakening of the two parties forming the current Great Coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union’s electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's first political force, nevertheless, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst outcomes of the two major post-war parties; especially for the Popular Party, which triggered the early elections, the outcome is literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the Popular Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, the voters clearly punished them for letting the government collapse.
As soon as the first reactions to the results were made, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the most likely election result, namely the renewal of the great coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed fear of a repeat in 1999, when the Popular Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ was the same part of the common government.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna on the national political scene, apparently rely on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and dropped from third in fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party has exceeded the four per cent limit and has not entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India risk cooling
If the problem with the Czech researchers accused of illegal cockroach harvesting in India could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he notes after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, leaving the talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
Nevertheless, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the local government.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher instance.
From then on, he could ask for bail and wait for free judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be graced," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts "competent legal support," the Indian minister mentioned.
He also said that such aid had already been provided to them from India.
"We want to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition that has continued for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and charges of these Czech researchers a great contempt," he said.
The Minister avoided the question of whether he obtained a promise from India to deal with the case.
“I have already received a large number of promises,” he only notes.
A Czech arbitrates the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is, however, as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the UN division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea.
Its head, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Working enthusiasm and enthusiasm characterize the dominant atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world so far little known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger bottom than the land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they indeed make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the so-called continental shelf area, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, in accordance with the Convention, be entitled exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred marine miles that represent the said exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The country's request to the Commission for the Establishment of the External Borders of the Continental Shelf should be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on numerous expensive prospections and metrise.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global resonance.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission awarded it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, representing the country's extent multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will gain in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the oceanic bottom area, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of mankind".
There, no more state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is assigned by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, saying that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, it obtained, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "a pioneering investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moving there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract from it over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concreteness.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German Special Forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never moved to action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the site of the release.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated Monday night, German forces were finally not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent liberation by force.
The Egyptian government allegedly accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened until then," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage holders has so far remained vague, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved arrived safely in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin, at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five holidaymakers and special forces are expected to have taken off on an Airbus aircraft and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones went down into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to juggle the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote favorably even though the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state bailout plan could plummet.
It went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, dropped again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to come into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the travel thirst of Germans remains insatiable according to this study.
As far as bookings are concerned for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted Monday to Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes the booking data of 1,200 travel agencies monthly and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since late August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be particularly demanding, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would be about one Third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Especially organized trips are highly in demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also highly retained so that sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Party
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits continuously, beer in liter pits and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the Beer Party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I do not have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a custom-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one seems blown or affected by shame - it's completely normal.
Only my Tyrolean suit dresses get some bizarre shots of eyes at the bananas-chocó stand.
A Bavarian tells me that I would have badly attached my cloak: "Left means free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, on the back of a widow."
Discreetly, I tripate my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't get so bad for these subtle flirt techniques and wear simple felts, on which it's written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and expose their naked backtrain without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds it "great," with a "oooooo" lying.
He tells me all of this after he relieved himself of the chop he had drunk before.
Directly next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild fishermen."
Others don’t have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, a number of rescuers run on the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses rather intervene in a bunch - always by four, they drag their cot covered in tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunk under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," cries one of the rescuers in response to my question and then disappears into the mess.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon crash in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey has expanded its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, European powers were looking forward to entering its homeland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away perhaps from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruin.
But once inside the arched ticketing shop, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, delayed in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the Eastern points, at least symbolically, is used to emphasize the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed car to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new century-old state, turning back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and in particular in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically constructed of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and numerous pastry shops where middle managers in costume-tip-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniglioglu could have been a center-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with either.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn’t choose?”
“Turkey,” he said, “does not have to choose between the two.”
He then emphasized one aspect that almost everyone with whom I have been able to speak has recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night without sleep, I rethinked these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
While waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no doubt anymore about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under the age of 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if ever dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me – and a few times they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley held so rarely this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focused only on certain people."
It will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolog by William Woodruff (deceased September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, MA and PhD."
This is what came from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Norman Hobby, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the Flamenco and the Life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda's Super Sales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
In addition to this, some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are many.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that the new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation’s commercialization.
First of all, Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
For example, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, representing a sales growth of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Directors of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely tackle the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand’s officials hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a sales decline of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, representing an increase of five centimeters.
However, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gasoline propellers.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepowers - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 1.4L 100 horsepower Honda Jazz has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan inspired itself, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by mimicking theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have manufactured this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for the Research of Advanced Sciences and Technologies at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Chief Public Relations Officer for Technology and Trademark Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that resembles a lot the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the eyes are composed of the bee, capable of seeing from an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the moment he detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation, but also acceleration and deceleration function, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Each second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of previous manoeuvres, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first hub for the development of new collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in a decade, according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, besides having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The sad aspect of this accommodation and especially the Hotel Master makes us think repeatedly if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take up 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp decline in its stock market price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The price held is 19% lower than the accounting value of securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% yield and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: last Monday, Morgan simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, “we thought that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, at about $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had “clearly” lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange price melting in half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was flying.
This cost dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third that put forward a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
Based on these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted out of polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
The "Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in quietness according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, covered a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the State's power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Bearing by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use that power and fight for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were taken back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 3.30 p.m. on a special aircraft at al-Maza military base at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in “good health,” and “no ransom has been paid” to the kidnappers,” Egypt’s Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said.
Captured on September 19 on a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been plummeted from one hide to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 Special Forces members, who were transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
“An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing,” said the official, who demanded anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We need to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our intelligence, special forces men," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
That's good.
But one area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in concertation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des Sociétés d’Histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are assisting the Belgian-Dutch bank as the first European bank in a situation of distress following the snowball effect of the US credit market crisis, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, in the amount of €11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also possessing interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has grown in more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be made in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell some of its shares, including, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be let go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty of the over-Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the cause of the drop in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as a new CEO.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken farm
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with an applicant, based on information about their medication purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting his chickenhouse to a fox,” said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medication prescriptions, in the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and insured capital in the event of damage, on the health condition of the client who appears, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even assure it.
In the past, they sent applicants for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had learned the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided from pharmacies, data on the purchase of the person's drugs in the past eighteen months. From that, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his health condition.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no much left to do with the insurer apart from paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is seen by insurers as a worsening risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in data research and analysis, and they must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also processed the results of laboratory analyses, and linked them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and simultaneously controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the enlargement of the circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient, and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data on the exclusive consent of the data subject.
Another question is whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, in the end, the hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India have doubled their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation on atomic energy will be mainly discussed.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for New Delhi for its nomination as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not delay too much on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, meaning an increase of about a hundred billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have harmonised the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civilian flights from a legal point of view so that air traffic can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's leading trade partner, and, on the other, New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this subject has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be entered into at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth €20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional manner, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the position of the publishing company in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Retrieved the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson cleared the remaining doubts: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was deemed to have passed away.
The U.S. Office for Transportation Security (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the site identified the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002 the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of alone flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without stops.
Among all these records, also that of having flew at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you're not waiting for.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, large surfaces and clear angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the "compact" off-road house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Due to its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on October 17th.
Thus, the advertising batting that will accompany the start of the new car will result in an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication envisages the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, you will have the impression that when you look at the picture, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then re-composed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automobile communication.
Will it succeed in arousing the interest of future buyers with this formula? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Neither had he ever faced the opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) from Campania and Apulia were added.
They had tricolour flags on which appeared their home town: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped to be unidentified.
They are inspired by the English typhosia.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosia of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian typhosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian Typhosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then takes action: in this case, it may be that the typhosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer put foot on the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk adding to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire, and not legitimize who behaves like that," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even rely on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (really not pleasantly expressed) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhoses has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistles toward Mameli’s anthem: these are not crimes either, but if you allow me, they are not polite...”
