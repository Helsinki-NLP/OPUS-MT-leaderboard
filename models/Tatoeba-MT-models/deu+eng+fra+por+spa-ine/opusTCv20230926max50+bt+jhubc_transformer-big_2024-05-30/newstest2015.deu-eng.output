Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before debogging into the bushland, where the officials lost it from sight.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the driver’s description were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of failure to observe a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is due to appear before the district court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was seized and seized for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is tried for raping women at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of trial for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reminding us of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a citizenship.
“Just as trade unions die, so die middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the Civil Rights Icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the basis of the organization of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-trade unionist forces.
The supplementation of the national labour law to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation to sue for justice in a civil court - and for compensation or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks unions have been exposed to in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict or aim to degrade this right are null and null and are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union – and then that this union should participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have been under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but rather increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - has long been delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made great in the past and repaid the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped implementing a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would presumably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, introduced by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and intended to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient reception right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to obtain their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can provisionally continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to achieve these rights," Federal Judge John de Gravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the judge is scheduled to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Proponents of abortion welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors would take more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana will escape a deceitful law that wants to take their health and rights from them," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi recently declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Proponents of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that enrollment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion oppose the fact that the measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor carrying out abortions in Louisiana has patient indication rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights announced.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for conducting abortions while their applications for patient registration rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who found ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases, as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter distances, she proposed as a possible remedy an enhancement of the service of in-flight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide denser care for women in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study found a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer, regardless of geographic status, and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowners
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products” according to a HTA study reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting gardens for park purposes, and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put into sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has dropped from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said, “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The station stopped its operations for about 40 minutes, but now sends again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they delivered themselves with sticks and stones armed clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country’s army urges a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and using without violence.”
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been plaguing more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to invade Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey Asks US Diplomate for Spy Report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has appointed the country’s oldest service U.S. diplomats to provide information on a report about American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy’s chief executive and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the reports of former U.S. analyst at the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity area for U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
A previous report, which also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence service in Ankara, caused significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning Strike: Truck drivers threaten with consequences for pendlers
The national warning strike by the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
Announced between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., the suspension covers all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

Sven Schmitte, District Chairman of the German Lokomotive Leader Union (GDL), said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is goods transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it will do everything possible to minimize the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the prosecutor’s office of Mallorca.
The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bartenders at the notorious binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption accusations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where the majority of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interrogated together with Navarro by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners testified that the authorities' cousins' economy had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about earning money anymore, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a drinking tour of Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the unlawful behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic drinking bar tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage were forced to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000) together.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
Spring has provided South Australia with a winter surprise, with heavy thunderstorms and heavy winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy thunderstorms, including a cast that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter had provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell again to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The poor weather conditions likely led to a delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time, windfalls reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start through even on a second landing and eventually started at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in delaying some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, the peak temperature is predicted to be 16°C on Tuesday, with possible thunderstorms.
Matthieus says: Time for great networking
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with a very familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the hearer to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: if the cable wasn’t there, in no time would all the listeners fly around the house, and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, for example, you simply say that you basically refuse to watch TV.
Why are these considerations?
Because the Ifa’s pushing at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who formerly blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices spread before him with incredibly vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us.
Yeah, are you still doing it?
What should we talk about with people who apparently volunteer to spread such a quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been primarily about connecting our house.
In order for the yogurt to reorder itself, so that the fire detector tells us on vacation in the Maldives that it is burning in the office.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we got air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we will lift our wrist watch, you say, "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
I'm fooled.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur," says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but it doesn't help because we're stuck.
From the daily practice, we also know that when a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools Monday after spending the summer in air protection spaces, while rocket and mortar fires fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the battles.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, drawn by rocket firing holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a local resident of Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is hard drawn by the Palestinian fire.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting; however, major problems remain unsolved, such as Hamas’ demand for an abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were killed, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denied this information and estimated that at least half of the killed were fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting against Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been converted into temporary shelter.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelter and fighting continues, education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will be reopened soon so we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl challenges NPD ban proceedings
Given the NPD’s vote losses in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has voted to end the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD in the Federal Constitutional Court should be ended.
"The NPD scores worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, said.
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the 5% barrier on Sunday.
A first move for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection also had informants in the NPD headquarters at the time.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the federal parliament did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now placed in tents.
The headquarters for refugees in Harburg has broken out of all seams.
Now the internal authority has placed three tents of the Red Cross next to them.
District politicians were only informed shortly in advance - they are little excited.
“These Hauruck actions continue to stimulate citizens’ reservations and give district politicians no possibility to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Green Group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg District Administration currently makes unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first recording are the attack of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
Due to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data’s figures show that home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale lies Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts on government spending and where prices rose only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, there would be a rise in real estate for sale in the coming months, which would undergo a "real test" of the market.
“If you look at the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the newspaper, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and attests this to posing "like a field master."
This is not the style of the university, the statement says.
Thus, the Medau family was already "orally informed in mid-June about the proposals of the university.
The statement that the plans were announced only in July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A street of nine meters wide was and is not spoken.
According to the current stand, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,” explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will be used in the future only by students of the university does not want to allow Pötzl to apply.
Parking is not at all because it can now be resolved intelligently, as with other public parking lots.
Thinking of the locals
The Kindergarten Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and would lead to the entrance to the park deck at its front door, should not be affected, according to the president of the university.
Rather, he pointed out that "this is not just about the kindergarten, but also about the local residents at the mouth of Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the critique by the parental advisory board of the nursery, with the expansion of the street would be entitled to lose one of the "few naturally left spots of Coburg", "can the reader himself decide".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, intends to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context to address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the university’s plans last week.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck should not go through the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but through the Medau Mountain.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes on about a kilometer of length.
According to the predictions of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles a day.
So far, the city has not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He went to international retirement with a score of 167 national matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful backspace player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces his team for the national matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will thrill my long-time co-players and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be available healthy in the next few years, for this it takes longer regeneration breaks, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed had to fear even his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not go past any body without a trace.
I have some health workplaces that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure properly controlled.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
Earlier this year, I realized that while I can control my head, I can’t deceive my body,” Glandorf told the magazine Handball Time.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes tear, I'm always ready to talk," the two-family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I would like to be able to go straight at least somewhat.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also won the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
The German economy declined by 0.2% in the spring
Crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also braked the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual opening, overall GDP increased by 0.8% in the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday passed through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "feet drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and we drove overnight to take part in this round trip.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists looked forward to the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club house of the shooter brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
Further, the route, which was signed up for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Major organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," but the cyclists still promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers plan a re-edition.
Konstantin Wecker's honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Alarmman, songwriter, pacifist, politically secure activist, ex-prisoner, into "Munch and Warrior" to 287 pages on paper.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, Munich, born on 1 June 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching song text.
And he’s honest: from onanie as a high school student to shop theft and drug use, he doesn’t overcome any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes up abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his societal criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his stay in prison.
The latter also brought the Livman Konstantin Alarm Clock closer to the Ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary".
Between all the high-spiritual views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example about battles in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he frontally pointed a tree.
Here, too, he is honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
He never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Stop with the cries.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were grown up when I was a kid – went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A lot of my life he was that serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now a bit brighter, but they are dark, smoked, deep stylish labyrinths with flame shots and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the bathtub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the casting from himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimony.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was bad at the end of her life that we started to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
by Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I got very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness and also had to take a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been picked up by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he mimiced people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comic on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 on New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “painted black,” Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don’t regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "award-winning light pillar of British television for years" was also a "grotestic parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on streaming in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just taking time or taking a little step on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was quite allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was predominantly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s why it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
A small voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This also went well, so it’s like a great shield of the gods who tell me, “This is your destiny.”
He says this, of course, with a doughnut voice.
So I stay with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorous outbreaks as he repeatedly mimics people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
When you always look for this, you drive it to a wall.
Sometimes I perform live at Apollo when I want to, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as it did before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a start, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I guess I do.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the Yemen Post, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are constant bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost employees"
Kenya has started registering all state officials biometrically to delete "ghost employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who fail to register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
In an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month were lost in payments for "ghostworkers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric registration data is included, a government message was reported.
Anyone who would not do this without a credible excuse would be deleted from the salary list, the notice continued.
"Through this approach, it is essentially contributed to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the salary list at both levels of government - so the "ghost employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal for art adviser Helge Achenbach will be tried for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi's founder Theo Albrecht, claim in a civil proceeding at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros in compensation for Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was announced by a court spokesman on Monday.
The lawsuit states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of artworks and old cars and Berthold Albrecht charged higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach bought valuable items for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school service, 23 of them as a school leader.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see man in the student.
The Snow Cape is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudet Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, he went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the goods carriage.
Thus, Judge locked it into the Upper Frankendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the nearest train station, drive by train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dorm room.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he received a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in the present city hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a re-classification in the now smaller school, then-rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers were able to get the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter retired.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz, who additionally built a workspace on municipal costs and cellar rooms during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled thankfully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who answered a school council's briefing on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to give children two things: roots and wings,” said the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always succeed." Whether he's just talking about his pupils or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge’s doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat each other, they did not get a criminal work from him, for example, nor were they done to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had purchased two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violin.
For the sake of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partisan judge after his retirement to nominate at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was chosen to place sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists take stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schottland
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or in Scotland, that’s nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of pauses made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4-bike tour with a companion tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in the Schottland Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radding and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which started 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started by bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the female farmers from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple cakes, cakes, cakes and cheeses, which wonderfully mouthed the skillful cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the beverage stand of the gym club Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with famous melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all he has attached bicycle chains already jumped today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking hall of reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Chief Promotion Officer Tobias Hagen, since the first tour of the hr4-bike in 2004 as a tour manager, was also able to take a brief break, though he had plenty of dealing with the technology on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees through three phones and a radio and the 15-member Hesse police motorcycle staff, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression from the spa town when they left again after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved for goodbye.
Upon arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were demanded in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, delicacies, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a member of the board of directors of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visiblely pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen later released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move swivelly under the open air was used eagerly despite the sports activity on the bike.
Among the guests, more and more citizens were mixed with the good mood as did the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of the “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies report.
The police did not comment immediately.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations of government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and counting phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Almost everywhere in Ukraine schools opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who attended the daughter of Yazenyuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful for them in the future.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud trail of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front experience.
Her career began with global management consulting company Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson’s top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was supposedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he sought more private-economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the duty of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and agitation when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopole, which demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But which newly-arriving president would risk running, striking at everything and breaking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps throwing himself off his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink - power, money, and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable securities, the upcoming negotiation of royalty fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world’s most significant media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs every one only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone nowadays and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says lowering tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a degrading remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that renounced the previous one.
Just sent a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I deleted it," he said.
Perry employees did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came out of Perry’s official user account, it was unclear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was drawn, who was convicted of driving drunkness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed her office's financial support as she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry - who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The tweet reads: “I don’t always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry when he explains it.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of attorneys applied to the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge, arguing that the law against the oldest service governor in Texas’ history is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funding to the state's public integrity unit - which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidature, Perry agreed on speculation that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself running near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares the housing market “normal” again
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England has “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought after and subject to enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set mortgage ceilings in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its 2013 peak,” adding that this offers a “stable action environment”.
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the decline as foreign buyers were pushing into the capital.
Prices in the city area alone rose 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average rise in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices on Berkeley’s private, cheap and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and stood at <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "village tax" before the general elections in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the Mortgage Market Report for April, which introduced tighter lending schemes, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage allowance in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for rising London real estate prices to 3 percent in 2015, based on a already weakening home price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by a quarter every year, broker WA Ellis said.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, time sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April, nearly a third more than at the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax income rose by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, and revenue by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion annually.
In a statement Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley’s revenue for the current year is expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley stocks stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the London trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence’s nude photos were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images from another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and charged the hacker with "clatant privacy violation."
Authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue posting the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you looking at photos my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house, I hope you’re really happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her, tweeting "These so-called nude pictures of me are DANGER, people.
Let's just stop the beginnings. *Word play intention*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande renounced the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They broke down, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchbrush.
Then he shook his hand.
Scratchbrush he knew.
He was stingy, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stabbing was a just-beginning affair, which had been more promising to relieve the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untempered hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaked, there were still spiders in the baths, naked screws had left their marks on all windows, and they thought that it was all theirs, and the garden was covered with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Author's portrait: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn hand-holding on the broken deckchairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had liked to get closed in the service console mentally absent, reminding the father of the country with soothing music and soothing old messages, when the sight of their crossed brown legs gave him a brown.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste achieved what decrees and regulations had never achieved, and as people in books choose the from table washer to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing big feet in a rough-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailin didn't understand it.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained, automatically laying two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at the time, and it wasn’t very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that’s all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of any of them.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only a place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gift - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of African Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What remained of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what remained of the Greeks broke plates.
Those from the Gulf and Levant states, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly as what happened when it happened, out of fear of being accused of firing fires, even out of fear that the flames would be devoured next, had opened up with Labneh and Shisha pipes with unpressed restaurants.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was hard for Ailin to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be accepted.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved this?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a bit weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievingly and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing to see in the whole world but her uncombed black rabbit hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
“If you say it,” I mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're giving it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
It didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn’t have the soothing charm needed to deal with the inherent cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons turned red and rose from her deckchair, threw the console over and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holderflower wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm weeds in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason I feel perversely attracted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not.
She was sorry for both the unnecessary infriendliness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes as she revolted against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same immense and cold ocean broke down here as it was on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more deadly after what was done than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch!
Knussing was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-poison to the nonsense love balloons from the console - they first knussing and then beating.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutchen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the chair like an old man.
She felt bleeding, too, but the strength of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him move away - just as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor - a man complaining about something that he himself had summoned up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, embarrassed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin looked at Solomon’s feet.
Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood supervisory body, worked on a brief lecture on the continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country where the reduction, if not the abolition, was most likely to be expected.
“Much has already been done, and much still needs to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness historically regarded despite the high-rising church towers between the hedges was rare angry.
But some characteristics turn out to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicated by stories of overcome difficulties, and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rawness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in the hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and deceitful dispute at home, at work.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of statement.
Feminist?
Again silence.
“I don’t ask that,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a workplace without prejudice.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results as you imagined.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and those things that you call "backward" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what happened, if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country’s essential vital force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country over the last quarter century or more.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, speak, declare, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I'm saying nothing but that we're not as effectively healed as we deceive ourselves.
My concern lies in the fact that without warning we may find ourselves how to repeat the mistakes that led to what was happened when it was happened.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we let go of our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “if you call acts ‘mistakes’ that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you’re talking about that they’d omitted their “rage” and “distrust” of “others.”
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about “us” and “other” in understanding the past as in protecting the present.
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disorder, that’s all we know.
"Of the one, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme said, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to be said anymore - that is where we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, so no guilt has to be removed if such an eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can say something -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passengers described, had been driving on the foot in a kind of "brutal anger."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official military representatives in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army surrounded his residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup d'état, but the military was reacting to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arms were in the process of being armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements are acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics that were about to cause devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a collapse.
“Even though no one has claimed to have caught the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho military spokespersons said on Sunday that the soldiers are returning to their barracks and the situation in the capital is calm.
Meanwhile, Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the rule during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disputes in his unity government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Procurement Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for threatening deflation at a rate of inflation of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week as to whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident for manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of worry, as is the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism are no longer effective in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to stir the fire of analysts who are expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say about the purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone in August is that afterwards the sector will continue to grow.”
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are currently obviously finding life quite difficult as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped the death in the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped the death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now hitting Ukraine – and in which children like them die – is now ending.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back to the shot-down school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she was only trying to climb back into the shot-down school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Fully confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were filled with blood.
I got up and climbed in again to look for my mother.
A soldier took her safe.
After a number of surgeries, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to get surgery again.
Some pomegranate splitters are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says fightingly.
“It happened to me and that cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help keep it from happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mommy told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little boy on the way, grabbing her hand and fleeing through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, in her turn assuming her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried out of joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flew to London (by the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be bleak in my memory.
I remember that I threw away all my toy guns right afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the courtyard and who didn’t get out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car above.
But now he is afraid for a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week, said.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir liked to eat Borsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters at a restaurant when Damir shot them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They are just like our kids.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes laying on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, larger than me, pretty, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and looked at the hell around me, with parts of the body all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember I cried to him, 'Dame, run, run away,' but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan’s barbarism.
His mother Fatima, a 54-year-old physician, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer that date comes, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
There isn’t a single day that we don’t remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school that day, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn’t like to see the picture, and it’s hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand this, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: “It’s important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
It takes dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall as September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget, but I will not be sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and go to a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanyev was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but couldn't do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my kids about my experiences.
Children shouldn’t know about it and they shouldn’t, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations in commemoration.
I know Georgiy won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something like that happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he doesn’t sport.
I would say he overcame the horror by 50%, but you can never overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that’s the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart is crying for those killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so touchingly worn by a special operation command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operation Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember at all the cruelties.
The world kept breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty held back their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, three years old at the time, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of overtaking girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands in court for overtaking a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment alleges that Mr. Steward had controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most inexpensive option is a waterproof point-and-shot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly locked.
Also adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to shoot.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize exposure time for insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose pictures, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the correct image setting is a good thing.
So you make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that takes a number of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesia physician, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the torments of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and illnesses, while those treated are predominantly busy with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty picking up myself.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently accused his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do everything right away than later,” he wrote.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray examination were present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers earlier.
But mesothelioma is different.
In nearly all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric – plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be scarcely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the fatal effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have been banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore, mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant London department stores to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to get healthy, we have already been identified as the starting flocks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have had mesothelioma over the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelial patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question, “How many of us will still get sick?”
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to cease, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victims of the disease.
Most of them have no idea that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for claims for damages, shows how widely the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless regarded by the EU and the WHO as a “large health risk” with a possible death result.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
Marks & Spencer employee suspended Alamy at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He submitted a study of the affected persons, showing that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known suspension from work or at home was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can assume that they are sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance unknowingly, even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service chains and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be whirled up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of work must be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos center, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs are more likely to be in the West.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so difficult to remember all the places you’ve worked on, and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day in December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old and did an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had a chill.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could get home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was from the breastskin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Amazed doctors took X-rays of his breast and used pleurakat whether to collect fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated, and his physician brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the breast fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widely used, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees eating in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
It does not only concern hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties, asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.
Also schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent objects in our homes as flooring or shell roofs have contained asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that is contained in much of our properties,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden scalp in the 1970s.
So watch out how you tear off your garden scales.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I did.
I spent two weeks in practice.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
“It was very difficult to record it all,” he says.
I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember I thought, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly deceitful because it is our life-saving mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart chest doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of a surgery, for example, is hotly controversial.
Some people think it is worth trying.
Treasure denied it.
"You can't cut the breast fur out," he says.
You're not coming around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counselling office for co-affected persons four years after his diagnosis.
"Hi, Cancer Center," he imagined joyfully when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart chest specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I didn't have to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and have to wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many people suffer from another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was realized that even a very small burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally admitted their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "complete compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after investigating his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients who strive for compensation, it is a huge problem to assign deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to file for compensation even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry for all those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have pledged in a normal damages proceedings - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represented a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is an insurer deal for insurers," he says, suggesting that this amount is one-quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not passed and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Labour and Pension Minister, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths daily, quick action was necessary.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma law in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” says Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my chest.
I just turned fifty.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unstoppable.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliops, such conversations are not through hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The illness brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a gruesome safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong’s right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is likely to fuel long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists started planning and mobilizing within hours of the release.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-Peking candidates.
"It doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that admission of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have residents elect the presidency of the government from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct voting right, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process firmly in hand through a closely controlled Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicly effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place in a number of years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours of the release.
During the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned to wave protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and there were tightened security measures in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.
The arrival of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement’s demonstrations as threatening business operations – Hong Kong’s livelihoods.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attending 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen appearances are offered by private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering today’s UK’s first luxury travel service for students.
To achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private planes, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to sweep their assets through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ very much in their expectations and demands from students aged 10, 20, 30 or 40 - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being taken off.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students.
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis of costs of living as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising invoices for the easiest basics of living before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something such simple as arriving at the student home.
Feminists criticize racial issue and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, MO.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions in the Middle West increased and attention was received throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100% revolving around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, personal essays with titles such as "Ferguson's Thoughts of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, this was an important change.
“I don’t think you can find many people in feminism who are white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day but are not considered as "women's topics" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how coloured people are under siege in their own country, silence is ear numbing.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleanly separating the topics; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now link the topics of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women fighters for women’s voting rights like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for voting rights could be successful for only one group each: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to defend women’s voting rights, and the voting rights for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why coloured women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists "fang" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raising a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and posted a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist in the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the race theme in America are still amazed.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are in contrast to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface – this time as a women’s topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that to rethink the issue as an essential women’s topic, it simply needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Among the details was an illustration of the living room of the house - to which also included a pig who had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly posted and has now been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House’s Exposé, Connells described the former congregation house as a “single single-family one-bedroom house.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
House sales raised interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW town Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning a lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on the turn this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwestern Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profit cares for conversational material in the small town in southwestern Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a duly completed for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had made the mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winner pair had played for twenty years and said that the winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas beat into the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood deep in the ankle at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
Yet the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rainstorms and autumn cold and were fully enthusiastic by the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, plays, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust combat art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and subsequently sent his men into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
At first, the "provocators" were on their turn with a rectangular shield and short sword, as well as a leg rail on the left leg and an arm rail on the right arm.
They followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm guard.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who ran against the "Secutor" with throw net, tri-tooth and dagger and after a brief battle hit the boy to the ground.
As the swords cracked metallically, the shields scratched and the throws flew surrendering through the arena that a fear and fear could become for the health of the gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an eye always attentive to it.
"We wanted to revive the everyday life of Romans and make the culture of Roman times experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city for one day, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of it were also to be admired on the day of the Romans, such as "aquaduct marble" from the eleven metres high and 1400 metres long Roman canal bridge that once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company once and now confronted the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time."
This is confirmed by Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering TeamZwei" of Rheinbach, who presented instruments of measurement by the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressively, the footprints left by Wolf and Fox two thousand years ago in the clay footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Ground Monument Care at the Rheinland Landesverband had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
It has been found the walls of an economic building with a dare for drying cereals and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
She presented a series of findings from these excavations in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a small necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspected.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill play, similar to today's mill play, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax plates like the Roman students once wrote.
The children were allowed to lay mosaics on their own at the stand of the Roman Thermen Zülpich, to make glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach glass museum and to use a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flat bread or a cereal.
With the original Roman carriage, faithfully rebuilt by two cold flowers, visitors passed through the amusement park, passing by the impressive state of the City High School, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a week of Romans from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also participate in the Roman year 2014, proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is intended to recall the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wanderverein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the lay circle of Oberbachem, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the trained Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a funny teaching lesson on peoples' understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf elementary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Week of the Romans, the numerous, but often no longer visible at first glance, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be made experiencing again.
At the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remind you of the finding of the Berkumer Matronenheiligentum in 1879.
Ebola: the epidemic struggles West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region.
A number of international companies are already on a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing at the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the most severely affected by the virus, with more than 600 people killed by the fever alone.
Recently, the health authorities said the disease had passed through every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Across the resource-rich countries, companies are running operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa’s economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
As a result, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice is diminishing.
At the same time, the region strongly dependent on international companies threatens image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important how far and for how long the virus will spread.
“Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the burdened state budgets of the states.
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be heavily burdened by the high expenditure on the healthcare system and also by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the healthcare systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere many people are already at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels also fall significantly back.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary of founding from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival take place from 12 to 14 September.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is scheduled on Friday, September 12th.
Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big shooting.
Then there is the big party tent of the mood evening with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9:30 a.m. in the parish church and the great festivity at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there will also be the prize distribution of the Federal and Gauss shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for "social entertainment through exercise in room-tutzen and small-caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had prompted the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 in the inn Lukas lifted the "new" shooter club "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult starting time, when it was mainly about finding a club premises and installing the shooting company.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the shooter club started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports snipers, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's records pursued every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time by Rudi Meier in 1980.
Just as the performance of the active shooter has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club’s local “Leininger” has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern shooter club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new “Landgasthof Härteis”.
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Pfarrer Strasser granted the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shooter rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work last year, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof, thus updating the state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the athletic achievements of the shooter club.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann climbed to Districts League 1 in the round 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml climbed from Gauliga Nord to Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstitching, catching and royal ball, club trip and Christmas celebration have tradition.
The shooters are also involved in the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on return to race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre crashed in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better outcome for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ashes track race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities announced Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will be charged.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After starting in 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily fourth.
After a reboot in round 122, Buschs fell
Carriage with No. 18 out of control after the exit from Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped back to 21st place.
Dance-Free Young Seeds Searched
Simply try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to joining.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated.
Now youths are increasingly being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, “you could dance entirely different choreographies,” she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can snuggle into the training hours on Thursdays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
“The training begins regularly with a warm-up program,” the coach says.
Thereafter, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classics, sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the sociality is not too short.
“We go to dinner, watch dance movies, and we’ve stayed in the dance room,” says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dance, you can also get into one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Children and teenagers can always jump into the class on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, baby ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can visit and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the former 24-hour layers.
Despite meetings between the prison employee union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of penal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The prison staff protest is expected to be supported by members of the Association of Interior Ministry employees union.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy battles, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers have been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from his army’s severe defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists, according to their own portrayals, have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said Monday, Russian agencies said.
Coast Guard vessels sinked
The insurgents also claimed to have sinked two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea for the first time.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships were under fire near the port town of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were deemed missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several towns in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukrainian contact group is meeting today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stationing in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO complies with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of “a sharp breach” of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and comments from the Russian side it emerges that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he intends to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A “Readyness Action Plan” to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary,” Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute over gas prices, Ukraine has been no longer getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently spoke between the two sides.
Ukraine warned that Russia could also disrupt gas supply to Europe.
Europe obtains about one-third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says tolls will be "completely clear"
Now the Chancellor makes herself clear again.
But it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU about the car tolls have been increasingly enraged by the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
“To be clear, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come,” the party chief said Monday after meetings of the CDU’s top bodies in Berlin.
Merkel has not yet decided on a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, "specific parameters" are called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said he had “formulated a proposal, and it is now being worked on.”
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommentary on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to pay highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned of developing toll concepts against the chief minister in the Cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
“The coalition agreement never assumed that it would paint all county and federal roads,” the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman said.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the topic.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU Landesverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Palatinate.
There are concerns that a toll may affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer demanded loyalty from the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism.
The Left views the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt intends to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads, which is expected to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gear and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be sitting in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said, "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride roller shoes or skateboard with the other kids and I was often hanged in school because of my way of going and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical record when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone about it, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all of my abilities.
I did all this on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworksman since the closure of the former troop training site
For nearly ten years, the former troop training site in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be exploded on the ground.
An ear-drowsing bang sounds during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last shot fell at the Münsingen troop training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study last week said, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in the financial year 2013, a 3.8 percent increase from 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the previous year, and it was the third year of growth in a row after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia makes the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in companies’ real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to apply to Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia paid together more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues as real estate taxes here amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax orders.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Corporate revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland received $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas, with 6 percent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate overall than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to up to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen — a transitional structure that organizes most small businesses — in District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general multi-fighter tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, Washington could fall behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city Guangzhou – this is the urgent desire of officials in China.
“We would be very pleased if a German brewery would be settled in our city,” said Li Yiwei, vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the twelve-million metropolises in the course of the talks.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, pledged to the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added during lunch with the party chief in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The Guangzhou official then ran up with Shepherd-Gumble - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity order.
More business
A second wish by the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party Chief Li said.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but canceled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
“Trade between our two cities is increasing.”
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The provincial vice-governor, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knower of Germany, nicked in agreement.
Well-kept partnership
Guangzhou’s friendly vice-chairman hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not in this function yet.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption allegations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, harshly enforced by state leader Xi Jinping.
The new chief politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is extremely unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top officer in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen cities partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained on both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it plans to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li said.
Joan River's family "squeezes the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today showed herself hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all push our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for heart arrest at a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Tougher environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st that allows the buyer to detect at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, higher nitrogen oxide levels apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they will receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion thing decided, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravour pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” an insider said.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowing people give the (mostly older) games a paint of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s precisely the way that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established tech company that buys a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who declare that they prefer sporting rather than watching it, it’s hard to understand the attraction that is supposed to watch others playing rather than taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 o’clock in the morning as he sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a madman shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless there is a game or humorist, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
How exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like to have: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on Sunday at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans attended the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Sometimes the entrance had to be stopped.
“It was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness during the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This happened early on Saturday, when the first visitors went to the open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded.
Around the utility stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings cosy.
They followed the first live appearances, whipped with their foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And that across generations.
While some of them mutilated on blankets on the white sand at the beach bar, others labored at a quarter of wine in the wine bar, the offspring raged on the jumping castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when it comes to making children’s makeup, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had all their hands to do to become masters of the urge and to enchant fantasy creations into the little faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he shook down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not break down.
“There came more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of “success across the line.”
That is why there is nothing against a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday compared to the folk voice.
He said it was annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The consequence: some who had already paid, did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors wandering in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire breakdown.
“They will be there next year,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
On the social network Facebook, the organizers also have to put criticism.
“I’m sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more,” Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took on a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems so tightly.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenss to the Amula.
Now, the organisers have a year left to address these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size remains a world record.
The final step to completion of the new case is the replacement of caps
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather plays, the action is expected to go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts of Britain screamed so much as her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial bone structure.
This ice-bucket challenge was painful.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she escaped her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but that didn’t go, the jaw was clogged, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that too and almost laughed in their trousers, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Britain was hospitalized to get her jaw back in after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull back on one stroke?
Lastly, there was constant dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
The boards are now thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Just a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriends Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks will soon be held about a common approach.
This is confirmed by the association boards Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once,” Sjöberg reports.
In his view, in the future, all members of both clubs could pull together again.
This is how visible successes can be achieved faster.
While the Burg-Friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had an eye on a rebuilding of the castle at the mountain forest until last, the Burgverein around Sjöberg stands at the forefront of the "exploration and experience" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfriends, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been present to the Burgfriends.
A new president is expected to be met at a meeting in mid-September.
The association currently has around 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect. This 'thinking phase' was necessary in order to 'think how it could go on.'
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfriends could also make a current mood picture within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself doesn't want to run because he resides in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
He said he would like to "continue to work on the project."
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high level of participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move forward with the project.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors’ tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard," he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving somewhat at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "important and good".
After that, you could see on.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, near-second semester student Matt Schroeder thought about a clever idea of sparing.
He invented a borrowing system for books by students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost reduction options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when purchasing.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented at college bookstores last spring semester, Neebo’s Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased from campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price they are available in the campus bookstore online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don’t mind the notes of others or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous issues are permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Aside from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rental
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please find out about the provisions of the business at which you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply for writing notes, underlines or signs of use.
Careful tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books rather than traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely looking around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before making an online order, one should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard journey.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cash hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" earned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" earned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
Tailored to Cameron Diaz, the film "Sex Tape" made only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon-Tamped 2 Easy" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" to date for children's films and described "Dragon-Denamen made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
With films for a slightly older audience, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film release shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and at least 2,000 canvases this year.
The results are based on the views of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s soon-to-release Jungle Book film, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash outcomes of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently made revenues with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, when revenues were $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic films and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cash outcomes as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema cash ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled a few years ago in order to streamline the league division, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The consequence is that those who have not ascended have descended.
Thus, Göttingen’s highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation avoided the descent, but played only fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedos women remain fourth-class, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve compete in the new Bundesliga, in the Landesliga no longer represented Göttingen Clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-Second in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC are here.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
In the district league start Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
Each with nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys – Torpedo II is still starting there – is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligaen start with nine teams each.
In the west season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Women's Circle League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhuhe.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no more women’s teams at the circle level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd class circles achieves set strength, so the innovative and revolving circle board will have to worry about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a counter summit.
For us, Stephen Fairclough tracked the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bufwaders were brought to safety with the rope wind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govett’s Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home.
A search group from local police and rescue services departed and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had fallen and had opened his head.
Rescue personnel stayed overnight with the couple, and they flew out Monday morning.
They were admitted to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The broadcaster resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said the stick-equipped demonstrators had damaged equipment in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the leader, whom they accuse of election fraud.
Police said about a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence, there were again clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured during the weekend as demonstrators attempted to invade Sharif’s residence.
They are calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.
The powerful military on Sunday night, after a meeting in the army headquarters, called for a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and using without violence.”
"The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has sparked concern about an intervention by the military, which has already been more frequently plagued in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri continue since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refused to resign.
Khan and Qadri called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself in the same way.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially peacefully persisted in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to invade Sharif’s residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer was placed third on the table after a second season victory.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was terrifyingly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who went forward in third place with Green-White.
Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes into the country game break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute set the way for victory.
"I thought I would pull in all the frustration of Thursday and put it under the bar," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel met in a Bundesliga party on 13 November 2010 for the last time so far, that was still for Ried.
The first championship striker in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory for him.
"For me this is very special, I am from the rapid offspring," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pool injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right side of the defensive and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirroredly.
He deserved the goal, he has already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Before that, guests could have written.
"Thank God we were lucky today," Schrammel said, pointing to the break-up of performance and results in the past few weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that he was "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played at this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proven that the team pattern is intact in spite of the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
He said, “We’ve finally played too zero again.”
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost players with Behrendt and Pavelic in the last three days, "who have been very stable lately."
The country playing pause must therefore be used to "lick wounds and put a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One of whom the break may be particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the crew, goes through pain.
In this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 via Admira).
Hofmann: "You can't believe that everything is fine now" "We probably also had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must come back to us too.
Now it’s time,” Hofmann said.
He urged, of course, to continue concentrated work: "You must not always see this in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we shouldn’t believe that everything is fine now.
He could not deny the importance of his role in the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot right now.
They stick to me at some stages," Hofmann said.
Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the fast opposing hit "from the category magic goal", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly rejected by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren’t enough concrete towards the goal at some stages.
We had too few degrees.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this peak there is quiet
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle issue of the summer series "Mein Stück von Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen depicted is the "Schweißruhe oak" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A hollow footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past couples, basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammoth tree with a circumference of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the relationship it has with the whispering oak.
The result of his investigations remained the quite sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underwhite browns to the laboriously rowed meadows and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal guardians exhausted from the climb.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows goat herds are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further discovered.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, you should be cautious, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place of residence for cross-otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are marked up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rarely found in height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that the building could fit.

After weeks of diving, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, enforced against strong conservative resistance at last week’s special EU summit the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as EU Foreign Policy Chair, she will be the successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-near daily newspaper La Repubblica depicts, the appeal of his Mogherini, who is also a favourite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party base, which is constantly opposed to him, will also be calmed, because Mogherini is assigned to this, although rather in a moderate manner.
Towards the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will establish a political balance.
At the same time, the EU chief diplomacy will be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is deemed to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for its ambition, will be able to meet the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 as a political psychologist in the youth organization of the then Democrati di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Center Party Margherita as today’s Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democratic Party Council, she joined the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the House of Representatives, where she is an expert on defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The presumptions in Brussels that the new EU Foreign Officer has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lacking substance, are mentioned in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s misrealistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russian-friendly course.”
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, via which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe by circumventing Ukraine, which also serves Italy’s energy assurance.
After Renzi began his term as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos she showed with Putin at the shake hands were taken with outrage in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin’s head to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people began their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has previously completed another education in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be active in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechanics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in front of the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages as well as the instructors will go to Oberammergau for a team building event, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed across all year-olds is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and put France in order,” said François Hollande’s main ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "its love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet restructuring has encountered disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay by his side,” he said with great applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France despite heavy demands for a loosening of the settlement of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his co-socialists to show themselves “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Justice Minister, spread sand into the gear where she appeared at a meeting of apostle socialist deputies and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant dig struggles, saying she could not imagine that the new Vall’s government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived even a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that she would win in early elections and was ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competing Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a market valued company of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo refused to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly hold more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises’ publication.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A Beijing-loyal group swinged nearby the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with Beijing loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze the Hong Kong financial square with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li’s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, are expected to be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon in front of the chief executive office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls for Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called for the Ukrainian government to cease fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “state” of the abolition region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine would need to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal basis with the pro-Russian insurgents seems to fit the strategy he has pursued since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists to take over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossia to have a real independence with the West instead of Russia.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist-owned areas in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately referred to the occupied territory as "Novorosija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory period of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of Ukrainian politicians’ campaigns for the Oct. 26 elections and while government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held territories hope for soon peace talks "are caught up in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in the context of the larger autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are jeopardized.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesperson’s clarification on correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined Russia’s leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulty annexed the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and a large majority of pre-conflict polls gave rise to remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control of a territory that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation should consider - after new elections - additions to the Constitution, which grant the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate on equal terms with the separatist leaders followed a further invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to reach a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilojask after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, presumably enclosed by the Russian invasion of Ilojask, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn’t hide for his anger over hackers who presumably stole naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who from Hollywood’s A-Promise.
The film city is excited after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal about celebrities.
The hacker has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne allegedly made private photos available due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said a news website that the hack was “disgusting” and that the affected people felt “harmed.”
The hacker presumably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without being in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A Lawrence representative told TMZ: “It’s a disgusting violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing but selling hehlerware."
Purely legally, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer children".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was a light training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurseler Brauhaus yesterday went on a bike to the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily put away the small muscle sore, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer children" (Frankfurt) also personally brought him a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
“I know now that I can – great!”
A little boy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in early daw and neared exhaustion, but happy to arrive on the plateau.
In contrast, it was easier for others to overcome the 11-kilometre distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circle day – red dress, red bike – did something about understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then turned out to be half-professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing down.
He also traveled the route in a glide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set off alongside Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "Here it is about charity, we would like to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to strample back to the height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had curved himself in the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "doing" the Feldberg twice, then rolling home with fun.
I also had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling over the Feldberg is simply part of it.
He had raced 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist."
He must be, because he was on the "Fixie wheel", although they are also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger who walked a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Professor Volker Lischke, who was safe with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know" from Frankfurt who trains for a special slide rail, only that he pulls the slide himself.
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – had been sent onto the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radlingen auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will succeed in blocking the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
