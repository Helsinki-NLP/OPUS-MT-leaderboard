Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people should meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is digged.
Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.
Munich’s oldest official map brings exciting stories to light.
It's annoying when maps are not current.
Everyone who has ever had to get upset knows this because the car-navi indicated a green meadow instead of a circumferential road.
The historic maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer of the Bavaria geoportal of the state government, are nothing else than current - but precisely for this reason very informative.
Especially when compared to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich’s Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flicker carpet that is not recognized as such.
The large map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called urposition sheets.
These originated between 1810 and 1864, according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, and derive from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today’s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The original positionsheet for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between earlier and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today it is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered corridor pieces from the so-called "origin", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the sun".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the stage of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district you can read not only the name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf den Venten" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once imprisoned with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Luften" was formed.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, which was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, chaining the so-called fools.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked with the institution for an exhibition.
Initially, 280 patients had been placed, and later it was extended to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, there has been the Isar-Amper-Clinic Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany.
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, to the east residences from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in architectural lines with the original building of the Crazy Hospital, which had been destroyed during World War II during bombings.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Strasse".
A decisive change also brought World War II to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs cracked many holes in downtown in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary works and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn stem track took place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map to the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizen Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and to be extremely cautious as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have occurred recently throughout the state and are noted here,” the group said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that people pass through.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed,” said Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had stopped gasoline while travelling through the state and was detained by the Missouri Police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers are being stopped 75 percent more often than whites in the state.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be ready whether they bring bail money or let their relatives know they are traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in the country’s 16th place in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws mandating local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Grass fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU Members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
"Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative-less marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the holiday guests' table comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementally important".
I can't make such a profitable economy on steep land.
The grassland cares for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the engine sense.
“We have to struggle with the conditions and topography here,” Schendemann said.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding."
At a cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would need to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be pulled out for a while.
“The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are worried about how to continue their farming,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced through the grazing fence support.
The opening area is 40 hectares, which cannot be wooded by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71,500, half was funded by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of grass fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers you can't do it."
Peter Weiß also said: “The best foods are produced here.”
The Landscape Maintenance Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support remote fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The presence of a conveying background designated by the LPR is a prerequisite.
Furthermore, the area to be fenced must not be trailable (exceeding 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weide fence project 2018, the application is currently run by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence.
The open space is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump’s White House takes the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe into a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus’ famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller Acosta said, “I don’t want to talk about a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the shocking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the misery of your rich coastlines."
There has never been a time when the "elder waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they had carried out a highly political action.
The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The link of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing had long wanted to change it back.
The great screaming neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Rather unusual, Limbaugh encountered something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, misery but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It’s about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship skater will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland it is developing something special" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000-meter track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain’s speech was incredible,” says Black.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads on this path and set five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 meters, is another Scotch to watch after a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her fellow compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it very special for me.”
“Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking Critics via Facebook: Don’t Apply for a Public Office If You Can’t Tolerate Voter Heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He reproached the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like the sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the Governor’s side – which is a public forum called official, and of employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast The Post.
“I don’t appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then some are disregarded as a so-called collective engagement and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called a “concentrated spam attack” others would likely call “first language.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn critical newspapers or arrest and silence demonstrators.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters beat his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that undermined Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next door to the final round in Archerfield last year before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club being built, and we see it reach its fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It really feels special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home floor.
This event will be its first appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how it went.”
With the trio on the field, former masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) came to this conclusion in a study.
“As we estimate, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were 400 more lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villiger Straße are in full progress and "are somewhat in time," according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than is suspected, since in the underground there is much that is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barrier grids is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is locked and only the line buses are eligible to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regiment in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coaled tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example, washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby marsh.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one dare to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted after a controversial referendum in Indonesia in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public hand survey before the occupation forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car hire in the morning.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet roofs that have been transformed by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“Once we had only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s Goldland.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s mighty military preserves a choking presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuanian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua in the 1970s became a genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, containing reports of previous year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric strikes are particularly popular according to another report – and the brutal destruction of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of casualties as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to stay here.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on his way to Jakarta’s Presidential Palace.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokoi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali as two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took on their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird's song - from Papua's Mee Pago strain.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed up, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead," it says in an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremia’s Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
“It was crowded, many shots were fired,” he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was it," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, carries only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because she was being attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be undergone,” he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” that demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gruesome disbelief.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid to be arrested by the military, I’m afraid to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting on the crowd and killed one.
“We were so in panic, we are afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to the TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament has called on the involved officers to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a disturbance for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and then, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend Papua's rights by instigating sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the task of women who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better trained and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media reporting remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign’s promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s most unrestly eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denied and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “different and widespread injuries” in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says it is not likely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” says Gobai, president of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that Paniai people, like others in Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's "torch" skyscraper for the second time
A fire found its booklet in one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It’s the second fire that sweeps through the high building in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we got up with fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection agencies said the firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4.00 p.m. local time.
The government said it was working on providing housing for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from the cladding, the outer cladding came to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believed the system of insulation and covering plates at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June, in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Though often very long, but also very valued five-set classics are therefore preserved to the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.
“We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve our applications.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not come before the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: the finalists of the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the host law in the next year in the first round.
To reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training courses, etc. will be easier and players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers brings prohibited items on the plane, survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of the US Transportation Security Administration’s deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered lately that they were mistakenly travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying objects with blades through the security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled through airport security and how many intentionally.
It is not surprising that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods - consciously or unconsciously - through safety were the ones that fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could see books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn’t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far refused that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla Chief Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less brilliant figure when announced the latest quarterly balance sheet: that of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully repay the €1,000 ($1,000 in the U.S. and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) “reservation deposit”.
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, Tesla’s chief executive does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models together are expected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, never tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are larger delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to delay in Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce smog-causing air pollutant emissions.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeal court.
This is a deadline for states to comply with the 2015 standards for near-soil ozone on October 1.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth.”
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was a reliable opponent of tighter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are resisting.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply increases the willingness of the EPO to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA’s opinion stated that at some point Pruitt will use his “delaying authority and all other legally available authority” to ensure that the rules are “based on a sound policy and the best available information.”
The Republicans in Congress are urging a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill passed last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put for vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important benefit for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists rejoiced in Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we inhale,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, to offer ourselves to polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village good."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergian Decreebook: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the certificate, on the Tumling mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a ruling court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today can be seen in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Ancient maps dating from around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The patronage law was derived from the early medieval own church law.
A lord who built a church, fitted it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This was associated with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two broke on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then first sounded in 1692, but had to be released later in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were hit and the bell cables stolen.
The roof was leaked.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They broke the cancellus and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church were threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was cancelled.
Only the church tower was left to stand.
On the New Year's Night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the current tower dwarf remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schöpferige Rentners" are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16, to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the Kepler Gymnasium’s Freudenstadt combo and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 3.30 p.m.
To the end of the serenade, a drink is held in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to check the approval of windshields
"Boisheim refuses" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Land Councillord Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his authorization for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind energy concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind power plants are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, but it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a form defect.
"Due to the lack of planning legal prerequisites, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
"This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received since last week at the Kreis Viersen," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them to consider the matter again.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings in the administrative court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the contents of the club's argument "Boisheim opposes".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200 meters high windshields on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines will be able to meet the electricity requirements of around 11,400 households – which corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-second households.
NEW RE plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer Viersen city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was deadly injured.
Two others were slightly injured.
The road was locked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old girl from Bornich traveled with her car as an escort to Bogel on the L 333 as part of the accompanied ride with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the city administration are planning to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the residents to shop in downtown.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise awareness for customers about what offers the city has available outside of the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional vendors is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation are radio advertisements, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the promotional weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the commercial association and the city enter another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
This includes new offers such as the first "active day" for the well festival and open-sale Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive Saturday offers and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
Customer potentials should also be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the downtown - from landlords to the entire town's businesses and associations.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy that was partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third nationwide “home shopping” day.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should promote "the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities."
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. town of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) one injured was still in critical condition.
One man died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initial missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were school employees.
As the cause of an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls due to border wall payment
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him for publicly denounced the Wall, reportedly telling him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the U.S., and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to accept refugees who emigrated to Australia is "laughing", "my" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dumb" after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore’s Ford Massacre: Activists Release Racist Lynchakt as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and roamed toward the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long stroke at his cigar and looked through the windshield checking.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n---r Roger!" the man yelled.
"Take him out of the car!"
Screams teared the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a remake.
But then when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience exhaled very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murder.
“It’s really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested—although we see them in our communities, though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the recruitment.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the replication serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must obtain justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A forensic physician lays a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained on their feet for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
About at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm owner Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landlord, Barnett Hester, down during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore wasn't her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landlord, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” an FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks formulates it even more concisely.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their depiction is vivid, touching, and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer existing in America.
It’s hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynch because then we’ll be confronted with its uglyness in us all,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return to these times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and presses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona replies to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everybody (at least all black actors) laughs.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still chickening.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--- he."
“But,” joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard R."
And that’s exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and strongly.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and executes Billie Holidays mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They all experienced Georgia’s humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels amazing.
When the last notes of the song run out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children hook on their heads, register fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy murmured, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through on him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatting excited about the recreation with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
“It’s hard to hear those horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do because they look like you,” she said.
"What that really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks's court stands at his table, eating and reminding of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The reflection is in some ways inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is doomed to repeat it.
"God's Dawn" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a colorful and frivolous stage in front of a gigantic six-storey scene.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shameful street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plast and Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an isetta, parks.
Stacked oil barrels remind Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power, and greed - that draws through his "ring" stage.
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), draws a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo-click.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeous nasty hage that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Marcus Oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in the storm, who bows his hands to the Merkel raid.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in leisurely clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was excitedly expected.
If he still had to have a full-blown pipe concert over himself in 2013, there was great joy five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner was probably pleased with this.
“It’s noticeable that the audience has grown together with the ‘ring’ in a way,” she said shortly before the dpa’s performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of his view.
I am drawing a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked in school all day open.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
How do you do that?
Quantity: I did Abitur.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, working with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it really is on the spot, at the focal point perhaps also.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social care during the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably take a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that excited me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
There are people in front of each other who have a different story.
Whether it’s a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family – you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have touch fears?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
Sometimes there are negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said Friday it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job reduction, announced mainly by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was taken by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved a growth of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy Attack of Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive weapon carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politics, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Authority has repealed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, stating that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the action.
The EPO announced late Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone 2015 Regulations,” saying it shows the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in reacting to our state partners,” EPA CEO Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPO’s intention to delay ozone regulations – measuring pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has tried to pull back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda aimed at boosting economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants communal space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a common space in the future senior residential facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the sales contract for the missing part of the land is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
While it will still take time for the area so far belonging to the church to be owned by the municipality, there is now no hindrance to the planning of the project to be held by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common space.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a communal room not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of senior living, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word "knit cafe" made the round.
The decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common space would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw buckles between his legs in this respect, the proposed decision provides that both saddle--which is based on the environmental construction - as well as pult roof--which reduces the height of the pit and makes the construction more economical--would be possible.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer says, is this addition.
If it helps, he passes the committee unanimously.
It's not that easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which you can't get that far forward, so now you lean out the window at the common room, she says, "I'm having a hard time with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors anyway.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the land does not give a grant, but rather gets a real, in doubt, marketable equivalent.
Staiger's proposal to split the proposed decision accordingly finds three supporters.
So, with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision this way, we take a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown on the road
During crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and was severely injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden by bicycle at 12.20 p.m. on the bicycle path of Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the Straße Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to counter traffic.
He collided with a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up on David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the match go against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
The staff worries of German football record champion Bayern Munich will be increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also waive David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
There are also Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti blamed his team’s physical condition and lack of balance.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time."
The 58-year-old believes in an improvement in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts fans to their banner.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering in the resin from star to star
In Harz, the first "Star Path" will be created in the country.
This is planned by the Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There has been a planetary path in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information need of many resin visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, exercise and sports performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Brownlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
That is why a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path will be extended by train.
“On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of worth knowing, for example, about the physics of the individual stars,” the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is much further away.
It also tells us in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Stardwerg – the Planetary Path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday night at 7 p.m.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of scale."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I've climbed for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that must fight Lomachenko with a 135-pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in fighting against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it,” Garcia said, and later expressed himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you’re ready...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the triple champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show strike strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
“This is the struggle that needs to be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tires
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were severely injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control over his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point Market Width presumably after a tire placer.
The car threw to the right into the pit, where it struck itself and then lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates – two adults and two children – were partly severely injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked northward for about an hour, then the traffic on the left side of the road was passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match, and the result would not have been the two goals against Braunschweig in the 2:2.
"These were two goals too much, and we need to be careful in Aue even better," says the defense player at Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the three-chain chain should also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortune no longer wants to catch themselves.
“For the future it will be that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing) on the line anymore.”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three-chain preparedness than with the four-chain preparedness.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players in the three-chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and that we don't make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be okay,” Hoffmann said.
“But if we can stand up on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start of the season.”
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I'm only judging the start of the season after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be discontinued prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue may even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know as much as 100 percent where they are currently,” said the Fortuna defense officer.
While the guests from the Rhineland are going to meet at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as a light favorite.
“The fact that we sweep them away just because we claim to be among the first six is nonsense,” says Funkel, whose score is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” said Fortuna’s chief coach.
“Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Funkel doesn’t want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of asylum-seekers tests in Sweden, which have undergone a new method to medically assess their age, show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rätsmedicinalverket) began testing last year.
During the asylum proceedings, they should make the age assessment more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failures in assessing the correct age of some minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “possibly is under 18 years of age.”
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person investigated is 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing human biological maturity to see if they sooner or later went through puberty than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we could,” he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case, it’s about 10 percent.”
Fully in plan
The work on the three bridges of the 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne-weight concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good in time, it’s going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Presidency Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that need renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and easy to make sure that the schedule is observed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, clothed with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges run over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red colored sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long, respectively.
On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tonnes weighing bridge cap on the northern side.
This is an edge mounting that is also used as an operating path.
On Friday, the southern part of the bridge will have a 2.20-meter-wide bridge cap.
This is where the pedestrian path will go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there also runs a fibre optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The local residents were informed of the project in advance of the works by handheets.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a single-lane light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher town entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations together amounts to EUR 700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest in German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the district of Vulkaneifel are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big campaign opening" according to the poster.
And brings famous names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the event starts don’t want to listen to the AfD learners, but rather demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel stays colorful."
Initially, the city picnic was planned under the theme "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the rounded-off - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums One World and one of the authoritative organizers, is rightly pleased: "Great how many people have gathered here."
There’s music and plenty of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could eat easily,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing their presence especially at the station, which is just a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a demand in Daun, but was rejected there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the Laurentius creeks already built.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on Rondell Vorplatz, he says: "That is the right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
Around 8 p.m., a band will entertain at the Rondell Vorplatz, with several speakers in the City Hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence remained unchanged, but until now the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little over an hour, the guests on the front of the square have a longer breath, but also there is the trend to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can leave - no special events.
The trumpet hits the trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher trumpetist Frederic Belli will be held in the Haslacher Monastery Concerts series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Monastery Church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or just "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in the blowing music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So Petkov is Solotrompeter at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazz Echo Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything,” Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh, that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was the one with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everybody I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived in dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or impeded me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
She particularly suffered from it, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, frightened and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself before the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can’t help you anymore if I’m a Democratic Governor.”
The rally broke out in joy.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal deal from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday evening saying, “Governeur Justice’s party change is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us than work on it to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is just the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World-wide athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be admitted to the sport.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were caught gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to re-use Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system.”
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a recruitment.
Drug testing is still insufficient and prohibited coaches are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for collapsed soldiers in Mali
At a mourning ceremony in Fritzlar, Northern Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unclear cause of the crash.
But she described the two dead pilots as "Kenners of their field."
“We bow down to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday, accompanied by a Bundeswehr Death Watch, brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon only family members in the church went goodbye.
Afterwards, the mourning ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
Among them were the Prime Minister of Hesse, Volker Bouffier (CDU), and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The captain of the squad had constructed the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, no one would have succeeded."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the mourning ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information about this.
Prince Henrik wants no grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
The Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hell of it that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Princessmahl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he does not consider himself equivalent to his wife – not even after death,” said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be in the end is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble race, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a heavy position among the Danes in his nearly 50-year-old rule.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of societal critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope to be indulgent.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
It was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants fast new elections
CDU and FDP with possible majority in Lower Saxony
Stephan Weil, Prime Minister of Lower Saxony after the loss of the red-green government majority, is in favour of a rapid new election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he voted in favour of the dissolution of the parliament.
Prior to that, the surprising exit of a Green MP from their Landtag fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its short one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step by not nominating for the 2018 election in her electoral district in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said Friday in Hannover.
Björn Thümler, head of the CDU group, wants to recommend that his group take it up.
CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the ratio was the opposite.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14th.
Thümler said the state’s red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag decide as soon as possible on its self-resolution.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility for the Landtag to withdraw the trust of the Prime Minister and elect a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally reviewed cleanly,” said Thümler.
“All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twesten's step "but a bit curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She called herself a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their Landtag mandate.
“Obviously, we assume that she will return her Landtags mandate, which she received through the green list of states, with immediate effect,” said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairperson of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry for the decision made by Elke Twesten."
It deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Although there were no content differences, we can't understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
“The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-green,” he wrote on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
In her injured vanity and frustration, she places her personal interests in the good of the country,” said SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes part in this dirty game of intrigues and tries to capitalize politically from it.”
Björn Thümler, head of the CDU group in Lower Saxony, wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The head of the SPD group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a closer look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamping pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states collect the latest information on the egg loads concerned.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even though, after everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has moved up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became aware of the affection of Germany.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
The trade, as well as the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are operable and health-safe.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg for eggs has been exceeded, they are not trafficable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time it is not the businesses who are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly guilty.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to presumed illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it only lacking in the staff or also in the coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in cases where crimes may occur are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect full information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
This means that manufacturers, retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the breeding of food-providing animals is not acceptable and must be discontinued immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be clarified promptly and thoroughly.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was funded without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can surely make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract them with legitimate sources of income that enable them to get the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then heavily invested to improve the team and build a global brand - was to become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP expenditure period, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of €30 million.
And although Platini fell ungratefully from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a flat-rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of €44.4 million for the next five years can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League season 2014/15 remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlook their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catarian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered as a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup Organization Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to every attempt to bypass the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG 2015/16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS about Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has a club, everything is possible.
“It is becoming very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency sda, a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packed shoggita plates of 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around a billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is seeking a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of its collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, First Class customers are spoiled with delicacies from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in the Business Class passengers are wet Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short distance by Chocolat Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national world championship and was able to watch the disco competition only from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Poy Amhl.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By deepening into the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny kids growing up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a reef on the 90s stalker movies like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and “a number of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novel writer, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-malignant plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H.W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underlimb of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could ignite this franchise like a kind of repeating “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose last scene the band will show as they are going to attend the movie premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a harsh Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea.
But it’s not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited on a shorter length, could better deliver his Agitprop satirs as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that western culture can make everything a food for a meal.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own newer history and its own.
Beating the drug mafia in the country
The police managed to hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor’s office in Konstanz announced Friday.
Fifteen accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 years old and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
In simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians.
The two will probably be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of more than 300 police officers were involved.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in the southern part of Germany.
There was an intense exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Thus, the major operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The main focus of the investigations was on Italian citizens with close connections to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired to a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Wise complains about large gaps in the foreigner registry
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Foreigners’ Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious misdecisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the report, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been maintained adequately, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, “of people who have long been alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore.”
"Errorful data entries can significantly slow return processes," the report said.
Statistics on people subject to departure also include EU citizens who would not have to depart at all.
Such false assignments, however, "led to a distorted debate about the dealing with those who are liable to leave," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This results from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is conducting such procedures "regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically no longer possible, the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state may send him back to the country of entry.
In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably.
Italy has issued guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a political spokeswoman for the left-wing fraction in the Bundestag, criticized the decision: “Families with children are threatened because of deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and a threat to the child’s welfare.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichbach, the blood donation service already made available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All of them before Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the church at the meeting of the municipal council recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's awesome how our bodies are designed for this and we give respect to donors who make their blood available to strangers, but it's still selfless," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of circular willingness of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned cans are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC head of circle readiness.
Obviously, the move to the theatre house a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times each 500 milliliter of their life juice.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowing down the speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “trending” as it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of an escalating pressure.
The policymakers of the Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to curb inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that credit costs might need to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth Recovery Package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - at 115 billion pounds.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption."
On the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and to a "slightly greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The bank’s downward-corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to those forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures damped rising expectations of interest rate increases and GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases as the sharpening first gets even worse before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent income decline in the coming years", but she added that wages will "recover clearly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset a part of lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to drop.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years before this will fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate increase had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the past month, although the bank said it was expected and will re-train it in the coming months.
The bank said the exceeding in relation to its target of 2% was "fully" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are loudly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with whom the existing deals expire and the new mortgages are finished, and many with royalty-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs for 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment as of September after a fight in the High Court against the NHS's financing of the drug.
NHS England announced that pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can decrease the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by health services through a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court last year confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a family physician can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence as it is targetedly used, captured and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, “This great new intervention should complement and exceed the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted to people in need and vulnerable, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been purchased, we are on the best path to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and delayed after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Interstorey and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“Before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nestled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above one another, so the architectural challenge was to create an interstorey where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the demand.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bow.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about placing the steel in such a way that it was the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above one another - with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Gold mirrored furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all Joanne’s bribes and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering art went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very slightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the base space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a fight over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be split.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also struggling to control the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years of age)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons.
"Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Luke and Mark are both bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.
Colin has retained heavily, despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say, "I really can't say much," because the case is in court.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our surname through the courts,” he wrote.
In a letter to the court in mid-2016, Colin wrote that he had tried to fulfill his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted me and Paul to end in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “always hopes for a solution.”
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
“Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in hopes of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that went into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information should flow about him — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be convincing,” former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise.”
- Okay. - Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that others don’t know—that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We’ll probably never hear anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep anger away from him several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from sparking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly promotes their views of the world.
Politico, who was fully concerned with this story, reported in May on the preference of the consultants to provide the president with doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is steadily trying to figure out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most sought-after criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals fleeing this summer.
Since the addresses of the serious criminals sought are not naturally known, clues from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the winter’s “EU Most Wanted” advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many fleeing people hide from vacation destinations, Europol said.
We compiled 21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been available and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of the online searches have been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of notices posted on the website.
Travellers negotiate a trench and return to 'Millionaire Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the "Millionaire Series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of trucks after they were thrown out only in May, but weren’t terrified by a trench excavated by the council to prevent their incidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pushed the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the council can’t even stop that.”
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case.”
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were then lost and revenues were also lost through the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council Office as a collective accommodation, leading to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontested in the municipal council at the time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke already then of serious interests in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the property of Freudestädte.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction trash containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some ceilings removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later be "nicely close to citizens", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are included.
We do not want to position ourselves on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of downtown, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already had conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Almost a million euros, he expects.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “Freudenstadt is a good market.”
Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator Initiates Grand Jury
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is reported to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already the panel’s first invitations in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence officials have long accused the Kremlin of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who served as advisors to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked more and more at Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump had personally taken the center and investigated the accusation of whether the president could have hampered justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Juries are therefore also called Chambers of Prosecution.
Usually they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called on by the prosecutor’s office to invite persons to hear under oath.
According to CNN, invitations have already been issued about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort also attended the conversation.
Law experts told U.S. television on Thursday night that the establishment shows that Mueller is not being intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide whether to raise an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new disclosures, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that accelerate the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not investigating the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller had only been appointed after Trump fired Comey.
Due to this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure over the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the President’s urges by the Department of Justice.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday that the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Marineforschung on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, is now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants researchers have registered over the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes on a fact-based basis.
Many researchers believe this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that was now broken was part of the Larsen-C-shelf.
Schelfis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Shelf is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this fake was the balance of waxes and cancellations disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shelfish has fallen down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C sling is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the iceplate is under tension and may fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key spot.
Melting icebergs and swallows does not raise sea levels, as they swim on the water and discharge ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelves causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on Antarctic Observation (Midas).
According to AWI, Larsen-C is the fourth largest larch in Antarctica, with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet now comes into a more vulnerable position," Martin O'Leary of Swansea University said in a statement.
“This is the longest withdrawal since the start of recordings,” he said.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shaft will grow again or fall back in the long term and may collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
CDU wants household rates for staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU calls for withdrawal from the employer association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has created 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Approximately 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and counter the lack of skilled workforce in the administration.
The administration should, at the request of the parties, "elaborate a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term demands for professionals, but to counteract the shortage of applicants, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, showing concrete measures for cross-entry students and encompassing a training plan, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel issues that you previously didn’t know so.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
This is a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.
It is time to take action so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU group, and his party go beyond the joint request.
Recently, he made a big surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and astounded the other parties.
Völkers wants to review all possibilities that enable an exit from the municipal employer association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities of the district - should seek a house fare," says Völkers.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the tariff regulation for public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the duties of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago had to be set up new rooms where employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the growing number of asylum seekers, Counsellor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel.
Italy intensifies sound to NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescue' because its crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving human lives is and remains our top priority for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,” the organization said in a social media statement.
"We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescue', which Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes on board migrants from the tubular boat, delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s record, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian Coast Guard monitoring rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail “substantial changes or impediments” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after rescue has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have been fruitful.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascents and trials
Nine Weilmer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Northern Falz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friend guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed viewpoints, in part on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfalzer Forest and the upstream plains.
There were always longer climbs in between, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint lined up at the viewpoint, connected by "flowering" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days there were many height meters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing sole in the outdoor inhalatory.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfalzer Forest from its best side – sports and culturally.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium grass?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge high-gage tournaments included.
This is what the first Bundesliga associations have recognized, which are increasingly engaged in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
“We hope that this will inspire new young target groups for the VfB,” says Board of Directors Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that “a number of clubs will go up on this train.”
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where players from different clubs compete against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual footballers.
“Real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future,” said the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be online far more frequently in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or FIFA's football simulation are contested at the competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.
At the Asian Games in 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea certainly needs to be used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid reaction.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: “Doping is becoming more and more an issue.”
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classical sports lacked in the scene.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, it’s like a large global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Interactive Entertainment Software Association (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is very little compared to the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte advisors.
Many countries are going further internationally.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football First League clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
“Germany is behind in European comparison,” explains VfB’s CEO Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia alone, and to transform the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time orienting the company to the modern market.
“We are living in a digitalized world,” Dutt says.
"You can't hold on to that only in football everything remains the way it always was."
Poison Eggs ade - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
In the meantime, almost all federal states are affected by the scandal about poison-filled eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of Conrad Roy’s suicide
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind grids and five years on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday, “My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr. Roy both suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes downward when she was condemned.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
She ended her life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility,” she said.
“She showed no repentance.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “horrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that her “age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day that I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain that we will be carrying with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persecuted" by realizing that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“No longer having that one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hold up, jump from a building, kick yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new mini-lame
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner for a great season - extra motivation is not harmful.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer could be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he stopped the band assigned to him.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confed Cup winner told after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach Kimmich could also interpret that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, which had come from youth players, debutants and just from vacation professionals, but he.
Sugarl is best distributed to those you trust a lot to keep in mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the heritage of lame can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich said, “That’s what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lump.
Right behind, this is now his position, the white band on the arm did her rest.
And at all, Kimmich in this starting formation looked like the one who can best take the rowing in his hands.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the uninvolved troop.
He looked for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (difficultly worked); Renato Sanches with linking to the achievements of the Asian trip on Devil’s coming out (conditionally worked); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not to notice negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
It worked pretty well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in playing.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the outcome "was not as we hoped."
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "I was brought for this style too."
How unusual this Bavaria world is still for the new entrances, we saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our FBW women
Austria’s most famous footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB women all the best.
The Bayern Legionary is almost a club colleague of ÖFB Captain Schnaderbeck and fever with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special injection of motivation.
The famous Bayern-Dusel maybe our ladies also need well.
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evidenced after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy at the request of T V - and at the same time blame the former minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all."
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau on Highway 1 is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Even this year, the ministry hopes for a planning procedure, by 2021 the construction law is to exist.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West bypass of Trier, which is the priority of the Federal Traffic Road Plan.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, said Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as encouraged by Wissing, aims to promote a Rhineland-Palatinate wine label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the master's exam is provided and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master's training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobilität, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, vice-president of the CDU group, points to the Court of Auditors’ calculations that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in receiving roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a country concept of how to address the shortage of skilled workforce in the region.
It is also true that the broadband expansion has been made in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated network supply only with a 3.4 rating in an IHK survey.
They complained about staggering internet connections and cancellations.
Former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreements, she was already clearing the field.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a callback.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install systems to neutralize exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of mocking the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations with Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a major burden for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message was delivered on Saturday on the Isar River.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, tomorrow Saturday a boat will travel through Munich, which has a special message.
If you move again to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a large yacht there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common whale, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the fleet you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage hill.
The start to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." is meant to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild river.
Last summer the float passed over the Isar river and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's tube noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawers, the tumbler noses of his characters are his trademark.
Also at 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
During his first years as an artist, he succeeded as a congratulation card drawer, among other things - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in Star and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures immerse themselves in drawings with the Sliding Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his drolly figures continue to be widespread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-foot-fighter as his opponent.
For the first time his characters speak in the 3D film, which is expected to come on the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-reminding conditions and disease-borne insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarfs, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts of essential oil.”
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
This year, the town Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Traders, ignitors, merchants, vagabonds or a country-servant camp are expected to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: take their children to the office who were the target of a grenades attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s or cartel’s salary list, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply perceived, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts typical of Panama wearing his smiling face with glasses or glasses.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, murderers by journalists are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more betrayal.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper’s office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or more are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
In February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she was awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid.
“I want to continue to live,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task you have as a journalist—either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn’t you say what was happening?”
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work while staying alive.
“They don’t like it when you’re engaged with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways,” to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The annoyance is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "the smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic blend of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed, and days earlier it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure on state spending focused on the governor’s home town.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this premises, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had regarded Valdez’s column as the best-informed source about the abduction.
"Earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body keyboard.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has become a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office for a demonstration the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Journalists across the country have become more loud by writing "SOS Press" on foothills and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since requested that she be re-allocated by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, “Narco Journalism,” he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also at the command of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a guide article on the cover page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even fled the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as all their phones started to sum up.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan resort had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.
From the edge of the edge, they have posted the news on Riodoce’s website via mobile.
The cover page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried out nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police officers holding guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner’s incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they were even able to find that his scaly skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of a "unsettling past."
The report in Current Biology described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has surprised researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he digged in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, despite being covered with an armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The highly armored dinosaur used a red and white mask to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershadow, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the nodosaurian family first made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of flakes and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershadow, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter-shadow is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using countershadows — think of deer, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurus was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk era must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds on their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was thrown out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chalk period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just sneak a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's asleep."
The chalk era was a time when huge theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs, stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Though the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne-weight monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he digged in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the mouth to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrinized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste still cover hollow armor plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Steined remains of the skin still cover the hollow armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the storm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carmbolage.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass karambolage.
According to initial police reports, around 5 p.m. between the connections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed.
There was no information about the exact number of injured initially.
It’s about mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backstop formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counterroad – due to numerous gaffers.
The fire department recorded the license plates of the drivers, who now have to expect delicate penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing guessingly you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are deepened into your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: pufff.
If the manager comes and wakes a soft one or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing gunless ticket control.
You simply confirm by cell phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently a test operation is running on two routes.
“If the offer comes, we’ll expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany at the beginning of next year,” said a spokesman for the railway.
"Comfort check-in" the train refers to the devaluation of tickets without drivers.
In order to use it, however, you have to meet some requirements: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way to book your ticket anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works this way: you get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
Then, a button for electronic devaluation appears for the test customers.
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken up the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at place Y during the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, working, still silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"Who wants to relax without ticket control by our train companion staff simply checks in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personalized,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.”
Those who frequently travel train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the companions does not have with you all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that must be presented.
The consequences are endless discussions between train companion and passenger, leading to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and in the end take the manager the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
“Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” he said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, carrying a sign with the inscription, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer secured his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
“That’s not usual,” Ferrell remembered his statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve become accustomed to and we can call it typical.”
At that moment I felt chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in theaters from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the views of people living in community and filling the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation they had countless times before this morning “on the black experience and the black state”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn’t take them with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a peak of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it.”
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police agency that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-accuse of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating fairness and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "documentate" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
Folayan recently said in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We are talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
“It’s no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because a lifetime on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: “A chaos.”
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she went on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Size Madness": TV Readers Discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the topic.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit Gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes, "Needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply, "Great Madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates build on a gallery to draw more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot where the farmer market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and that is to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Farmer Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always love.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, this is also the case.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.”
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery, it depends on the amount of the rent.
But it shouldn’t be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even an ordinary weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
Because after all, the goods offered there are fresh, are offered mostly directly by the producer and are also cheap.
As you can see, stores in a mall are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, there are almost no more specialty shops and what remains of them will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: "A mall with a market hall doesn't fit me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery succeed in expelling all the stores from Bitburg beforehand?”
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmer market hall thanks to the crazy many - I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers’ market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown that almost unnoticably resemble - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst sentenced a 35-year imprisonment after she made public secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp but somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
The prison suppressed her image, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was apparently uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette tube and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg told a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal mail friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release just a few days after the book was published after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy encounter.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with its oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and Aces, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s advanced scientific lexicon).
“What people hopefully will take from it is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video plant, Spurious Memories, is also seen.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning appearing like King Kong with a hands-on phone in hand from the discipline basins of the United States.
“If they cold your speech, they have won,” it says.
“So never shut your mouth.”
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia.
“I still get gooseberry when I’m talking about it.”
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition in person – as it was anticipated in the comic book – but if she did, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, gathering together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
“In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are searched as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Agency says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigate the stings as murder while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in Britain and willing to help the U.S. investigation agencies in any way we can imagine.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities would help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in Apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued a statement to residents: “The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible home incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-Premier Mutko
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap on compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded doping in Russian sports.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted to a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won’t admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In a conversation with the Russian point of sales RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to Moscow’s headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be re-employed.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was announced by the groups of companies.
It is purely a precautionary measure, and no further health impairment can be assumed, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees’ happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board of directors directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can drill after why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punishes those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw a rise in interest and activity early this year amid the Uber trap in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel, said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices — can be identified and addressed faster.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree perspective on employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all of its funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Businesses run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data about employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at business management company Kotter International, who saw companies relying too much on data collection.
"Cause if you don't follow employees will ask, 'Have you really heard me?
Do you take care of it?
And whoever doesn’t care about it, why should I?”
Madison Reed, now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of employees in an industry that is known for high revenues.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
And when you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s 11 a.m. as a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the team’s new exercise fields on campus.
Some have removed their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled for the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
“This is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings should start at 7:15 a.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora’s six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises in the course of August, 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change even if it added another point to the busy routes of the players.
“We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep talking, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we get through Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been thrown with footballs that clear a protective net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far from thinking that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact reviewers and then show their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact reviewers who may display the results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact check will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third-party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they’re reading and sharing,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a slip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Mopharian Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says painfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to Edward's age and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: He wrote Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library—a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
“This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there.
I love archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome greeting a little bit"), all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape managers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic."
Journals, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.
“Girls, let everything go!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smugler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Scotney's favorite Rhodes' family: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women – I imagine them as a bunch of pretty-looking boys, with a talent to advertise inheritors.”
After the end of his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go back,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle covered in Rhöndorf
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday’s roundshow).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August, a festival will be held on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?", the creators of the action have asked since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We don’t really think that,” they write on their website released yesterday.
“But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than “just” a logo and a slogan, he said.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be cost the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year, in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officers’ corps.
Same as this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
The deliberations were also attended by the five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
The number of civilians in the YAS was overwhelmed.
The government pulls the army.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy have been dismissed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army – mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the leading force in the coup attempt.
About 486 people who were reported to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempted overthrow a "God's gift" because he gave it the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
The General Staff is concerned about an increasing "islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the abolition of the headscarf ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The major purification of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a decree to fire another 7,395 servants, including 2,303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were once considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they put in reference to their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least with reference to the European Union’s reform plans.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeted to advance the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine Vocal Europe, an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the coup attempt for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists in a few years."
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway, there are doubts in the Alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army’s operational readiness.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weaken,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the U.S. green cards are issued to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing shuttle
Over the past few months, there has been constant disputes about the future of the race platform shuttle – now it should go quite quickly.
Before the end of the year, the Marode route on which the tourist railway runs will be built.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," said Secretary of State for Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75%.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finally voted, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railways as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
“This negotiates the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
The Racesteig shuttle is scheduled to be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The track is also very faulty in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn’t be even crazier in 2017, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People laugh at it, but the companies are making a lot of it, and we’ll get to see it even more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible,” True Companion’s website said.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - how real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissive feminine qualities, the allusions to rape when you move a step towards Frigid (meaning reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their origin and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the marginal zones can be very teaching in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually assaulted women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphic pictures, the swallowed bodies and the stabbed eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can’t separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the speech of 2017: maid
Trump’s great achievement?
It makes Mitt Romney an integral part of common sense.
It has become a binary wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. elections have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with Trump’s horror.
We're all supposed to strictly try to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I find it in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his fellows will no longer repel us one day.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear to be an item of reasonability compared to his standards.
Nowadays, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s ugly version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof, whose 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both in fact appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the Republican’s next candidate only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are groaning and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the flickering music imparts this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it’s the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip – this to buy something over the store table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what a neutral exchange should actually be, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologizing smiling while I had the tired experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered according to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to file this time against Pistorius Appeal’s six-year imprisonment, which they say is too merciful.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would raise an objection to South Africa’s Supreme Court, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders were dismissed from Fützen and Eppenhofen during the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to high school in the future, four will go to real school.
School leader Angelika Sitte greeted parents and public representatives at Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but was then released to freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and broke it out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The chickens danced with the young gockles that cylinders wore to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cubs), it belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who is repeatedly involved in teaching shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chicken time is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She dislikes to dismiss her students after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
Finally, he could rely on the fourth graders.
In conclusion, all the students made a song of summer time and holiday season.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-class students are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Ministry said, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally tented people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sithonia by the police.
The same day they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are aimed at improving the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emissions classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives evaluations:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have scrubber software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Its upgrade has been ordered by the Federal Motorsport Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed of updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified an accurate date.
Daimler has announced that he should write to every person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the overall changes last?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
“We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on environmental issues so far.”
How long should the update last?
The upgrade itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
In the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the sought after awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and television producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honored.
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who has become known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He said, “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the funds – and that has burdened me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised, but suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years Wacker has been city builder.
And he still enjoys the work, as he teaches in the press.
He reports on varied but also challenging tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application yet meets the demand profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, with respect to the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for a recruitment.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
Because this function will definitely retain the city.
If it could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen Parkplatz, for instance, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, as well as the stadium renovation is still the topic.
The latter alone will make a book with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
Work here is fun.”
There is a great deal of space for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building yard and gardening can be reacted to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the green areas is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is protected as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the departing town builder.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything goes over my table here."
In support and coordination he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes that his successor stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who truly identifies with the place and wants to stay."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the information of the city of Haslach, you should be able to have a graduate degree as an engineer or bachelor with a specialty in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction regulation and construction planning law.
Construction and underground construction, construction planning, land acquisition affairs, administration of urban properties, urban farmhouse with building yard and urban gardening as well as lower building law authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South railway track locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway railway passage in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the coming freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
Near the scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausanne strike," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves at great risk and also jeopardized train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement, the perpetrators could also receive penalties from the rail customers.
Overall, a “significant” sum should be expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was fixed on Friday afternoon, railway traffic on the southern railroad track could be conducted without obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Goods trains didn’t fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of upper lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red Meat, Dairy Products and Chocolate Could Help Relieve IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach spasms and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal millies if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's intestinal microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's guts were DNA-sequencing and six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but without them missing in mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "geny" to Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genie," Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signing began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the preparatory Asian tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also launched at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-up XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of its four priority new obligations.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for it," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve made a lot of effort.”
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
This was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no disruption from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the bond - that was the most important desire of the electoral campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with increasing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep strikes.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
The Greens Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return his mandate," the German executive and electoral campaign leader of the Greens told Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
"This must not be true at all," a SPD election fighter sighs when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The poverty began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades of that time calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
This was also the case – and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel destroyed the SPD, the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly destroyed the party.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades recalled themselves.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much wrong in crisis communication afterwards, everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and his role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Poor survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil has been trying more and more strongly in the past weeks to put accents in the Confederation.
The aim of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by fellows in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They granted it because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not guilty of the party's internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz not at all.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democracy-damaging how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD-Bundestag fraction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon deputy continued.
The logical consequence would be that he returns his mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD’s federal parliamentary fraction, complains of an “undemocratic manoeuvre”.
“The voter will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister,” Oppermann, who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the Bundestag elections, says to the RND.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Grants for local core III
Those who want to renovate their home in the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back on what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfengen.
At the time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is important to promote internal development, rather than just opening up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the government office of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest of which would come from the municipality.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal country program "Social City", within which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and employment conditions, and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject-based, i.e. per plot, carried out.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a statute.
The grant period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, by September of this year, the inventory would be carried out, as part of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutory decision should be made as possible, so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban malformations and deciding when and to what extent it will be repaired.
A note of renovation will then be entered for the respective property in the land book.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that an important success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Arc", which deals, among other things, with the construction condition and the renovation intentions.
The grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Arc", can provide information on the size, distribution and residents of a housing.
The blue "operations sheet" should only be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler further emphasized that the distribution of funds works according to the "wind dog principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can’t “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Local core II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty" for the attendees.
British inventor sets up a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between the thumb and the indicator finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built in both home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House’s advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military reports left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on July 17th at about 7 a.m. for the event, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
The records provided to the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could break the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo operation is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane performed taxi services in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor.
“The White House is enthusiastic about the show ‘Made in America’ – which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to set off the U.S. president in the White House with accurate sets of centimeters.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said taxpayers took the burden for none of the other accessories presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but rather take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present this week things that are made in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky’s representatives and joked the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before difficult task
Top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga is at the third table Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the third table Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has gained a sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions, I find the team very good.”
Class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV are mainly ensured by imports from the far north.
“Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double,” says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us as always.
You need a good portion of luck.”
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman still active in the Italian Biella Challenger tournament does not succeed in the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing in the Czech Liberec tournament comes to his first deployment this season.
The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he was supposed to be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the Junior World Ranking in January 2016, someone from the coach staff around Marius Zay will fill up the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Donald Trump didn’t look really happy when he put his signature under the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
“In his haste to pass the law,” he said, “Congress has wrapped up a few ‘unconstitutional regulations’.”
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies to help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors have been concerned since then by OMV, which jointly with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 guns to choose from.
"The press" looked at which of the companies could defend them and which could really hurt them.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be brought to the center of the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is not over yet.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the show’s latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world’s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1.
Roll backwards: the city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban daycare centres, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over food supplies in the urban daycare facilities (Kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director of the Department of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking is continued outside the house: a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city has 46 daycare facilities in the Krefeld area, with 44 children having a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year there were 2,800 children sitting at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"Not only children who are cared for for 45 hours a week now eat lunch in the babysitting room," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a kid,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly scope.
“The kitchen workers now belong firmly to the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
“So they are much more involved and it’s easier for kittens to implement educational concepts.”
That’s what it’s all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
“The kids should help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team would make sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a well-known force in the babysitting, a person who is familiar to them, not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison of costs between own management and external procurement for the city, the press office says.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-employed.
“But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the educational area,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women’s political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Chief Executive of the United Nations Mission, said hundreds of women will run in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year’s elections will be handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reported that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters were registered.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, were reportedly attempting to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men contacted the 13-year-old who stayed on Kolpingstraße with friends around 2.55 p.m., wanting to phone the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators attempted to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but failed.
The duo fled without prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB worries about investing in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company has remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would “learn as first” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie’s urged “to express concern that funding for modernizing production lines is not being pushed forward.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, the rising costs of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’ branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, discussing some issues openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are continuously reviewing our businesses – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully acknowledge the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility, and if our operations at the site change, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn about this."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not decline in her persecution of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to have one of the best players of PSG sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offerings to Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the vehicle's covering.
The Schramberg Police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, is asking for hints.
For an accident on B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the steering board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum travelled with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese around 7:55 a.m.
In the area of the town circumvention of Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guideboard.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the incoming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident injured, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau at phone 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Cathedral of Regensburg continues to create discussions.
Christian Weisnder, a spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", told the German press agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today’s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the Catholic Church’s reputation if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized that the reporting of violence in the cathedrals was measured with "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and disgraceful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that it is normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian radio station: "You like to go to the church and that is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal educational means" "to cope with horrifying children, as I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Totally wrongly, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorabilia band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection,” says Hesemann, “because all this had nothing to do with him,” he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report of the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Regensburg Diocese for the Enlightenment, say?
A total of 547 cathedrals in Regensburg were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with "high plausibility" victims of assault, and 67 cathedrals were sexually abused.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment could also be more severe for the students.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Domspatzen in Regensburg relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on protected persons at the Domspatzen in Regensburg" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears to be a cholerist and perfectionist, who became more often graspful when a Domspatz did not perform top musically.
How do you consider this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort to read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exonerated from any suspicion of fellow perpetrators or fellowship in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
You can accuse him of not having learned about it too late or not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibited a very excellent testimony, described him as "warm", "popular", " sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has once led to anger outbreaks.
Not only did he bump with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but he also distributed ears and pulled too naughty boys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know such punishment methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
In comparison to what this report is actually about, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, that is, of course, bagatell.
The question is whether it does not have to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working eagerly with the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the context of the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the issue of abuse in the Cathedrals of Regensburg.
Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also be blamed on any involvement or fellowship with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
“I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it,” one affected person said, “It was very embarrassing for me.”
The real problem in enlightening sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent for shame.
If they didn’t even entrust themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen-Schülers evaluate Ratzinger’s role in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student surveyed formulated it as follows: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which precisely he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is really absurd to assume that just him ... boys have become more invasive or clearer or more open than to their parents, board leaders, trust teachers, etc.
“Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that he had been entrusted to students concerned in advance and/or their environment could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be exonerated from any co-authorship.
He cannot be accused of having been prevented or reported.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as unfortunately in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "excess of violence" to be read at the Cathedral of Regensburg.
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, however, an abuse of the report.
Indeed, there is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedrals.
All the horrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered terriblely, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium.
As most Witnesses emphasize, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
The same is true for Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that “many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him”.
At the very least, the accusation remains of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods during which he was informed of the states in the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears from the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out that “the punishment for beating is continued in the preschool.”
Already in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when beating sentences were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as everyone of us probably knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
You can’t say he’s always looked away.
That's just not true.
In 1980, the punishment for beating schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: Historians are talking about the “fall trick of anachronism,” i.e. the danger of evaluating past according to current moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what was offended in preschool with abominations and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then usual.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad that it’s finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. ear fisting and drawing on the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
As physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of punishment also come into question?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedrals played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of absolute discipline, he would have hardly been able to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and sweets alone, you do not make rebellious boys great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through my work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply faithful and heart-good person whom you cannot imagine he could hurt even a fly.
I get regularly with how many former cathedrals still today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he once was strict to them are clearly in a minority.
Most cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely, that may be - but also a loving respectful person to whom they still look today and whom they worship almost.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is accused of him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.
But it is extremely unfair to make a man the medial goat of sin, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
Because the report that was just published relieves him.
Now the decency would order to finally leave a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would probably know the Regensburg Domspatzen in peace.
