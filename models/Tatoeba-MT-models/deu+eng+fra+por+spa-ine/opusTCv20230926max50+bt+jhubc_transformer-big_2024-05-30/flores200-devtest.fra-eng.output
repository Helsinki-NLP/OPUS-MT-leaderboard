The U.S. Federation of Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC declaration that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than withdrawing accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and accountable environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the feathering of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called spine, but however show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and beards – researchers have deduced that spine was likely a subsequent evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather rather than a chicken's down.
Scientists say it is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A trapped car exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor’s office said nineteen of the wounded were police officers.
Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh (IS) activist as the suspect responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as the other stars, and the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used in conjunction to determine the number of Rossby of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
With regard to magnetic inversions, the smaller the number of Rossby, the less active the star is.

He added that “they should not be asked, however, to assume obligations that go beyond their stages of development, responsibility and capabilities.”
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12 a.m. GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this stage will end sectarian war, growing violence or slip into chaos.
The report opens with an appeal for an open debate and consensus in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq and strongly advocates for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken by the end of the year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a traction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a sort of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke from the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multiresistant tuberculosis (MR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new mutation was "very troubling and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients reportedly contracted the virus in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital staff.

Several million bottles of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
Vaccine delivery plans to the historically most affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority given to these diseases over others.

Infrared images reveal, in view of temperature variations during the day and night, that these are probably caves.
“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.”
“Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they look similar in that they are deep holes in the earth,” says Glen Cushing, a member of USGS crew and staff at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally an experience of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a cabin, put in an envelope a preprinted sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the urn and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the polls must be transparent so that voters and observers can find that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road to which the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow rescue services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her prosecution and trial, but eye testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widespread.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos of suspects, etc.”
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, said to journalists that no further comments will be made until the indictment is brought.
According to the escape, the document will cover the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred for the two nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional parasite test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's interim responsible for the conservation of the park and heritage, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were duly trained and trained on safety instructions.
Martelly introduced a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous EPC as part of a set of measures to engage the country on the road to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the extensive protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were expected to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these aircraft.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-serious.”
The department reacted by calling it “really regrettable” Apple’s postponement of the report.
The earthquake struck the Marian women at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said that no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre said there were no signs of tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostages of Hong Kong tourists by turning their buses to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been saved, and the deaths of at least six of them have so far been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released prematurely, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a career as a doctor.
He attended an obstetrician training, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators retrieved two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim at 100m and 200m free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, which were prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number of first known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more particularly how Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as “spoke and political nonsense.”
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not on ground radar systems used previously, allowing air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is not available and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation gave rise to the possibility that the game could be played in closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process has been estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinson, Geospiza fortis, and the conical pinson, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled into thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be done very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange feeling and produce a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a watershed in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call into space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought to us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat prey of equally medium-sized size, ranging from rabbits to antilopes and other oats.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free cats) that eat small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special task dedicated to each cat, preventing him from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called clusters.
The clusters are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lioncews.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packets of wolves or dogs, surprisingly lion-like animals (but not other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes hardly), swim, jump from large distances, and drag with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (gender Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roaring of the tiger does not resemble the wide roaring of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and roaring.
Ocelots love small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, the ocelots track and find the animals to eat (prey) through the smell, sniffing their journey on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealingly. The ocelots hunt their prey by merging in their environment before casting on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be regarded as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., they exhale).
The plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shadow.
We make our homes and our herbal clothing. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without the plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were endowed with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palace, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue; his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered into the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not sized against him.
Although the Romans ate food we knew, they ate some strange or unusual party dishes, including wild boars, pawns, snails as well as loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder he found Greenland — and named it that way — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Treasury of the Templars, you may think a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Declaration of Original Independence dated 4 July 1776" were read.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The landing of day J and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupant instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated the south of France and were headed toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilisation" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civil", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some ways, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and fair dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it entrusted itself to the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It was also not entitled to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between states.
Articles required unanimous consent from all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second-most-titled team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often designated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing there mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of Aboriginal cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which he surrendered the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera photographic sensor format.
The 35 mm format is in fact, and it is quite confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm height.
Thus, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is highly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that raises dynamism while providing protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has linked European states with each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the rotor.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of the hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain undermines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic has sparked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or every family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces, the most known of these periods is the period of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to Republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Therefore, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to attend a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, nothing can be seen but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains; from the inside of the cave, very little can be seen or heard of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or “necropolis of Giza”, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, comprises several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Keops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as his family members.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “draw” symbol resembles a clip or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An arch up usually produces a softer sound, while an arch down is stronger and stronger.
Do not hesitate to register your own brands on the pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and therefore you generally have to respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of sellers.
In a chariot, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who scream and scream threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their chariots.
At one point, a member of the crowd branded the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Age was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that far exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on inherently rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as that of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were returning charged with presents such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could accuse of a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest progress of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced livelihood agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, by negligence, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children have been locked up by individuals (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by parents of a serious intellectual or physical impairment that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical arrangements) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way to help learners discovering new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to handle for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, careful and educational, but it is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safety zone for these children.
Our host family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster family placement is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Speech of the President, pointed out how people who are unable to understand the speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet his amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while bringing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
Well considered, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” somewhat in the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet wake-up call, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of the bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorythm include drinking a lot of liquids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields both in Africa and in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
But these plans became almost obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish or bilateral pact of non-aggression, as well as others.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and assets, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move its people and assets.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, with Americans trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean for soldiers and equipment to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds wandering over the hills or other grazing areas, often treated by goats who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods still run today.
The wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and drive larger loads than on the slightly more accidental roads of the day.
Crossroads were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first means of locomotive was walking: humans began walking up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk standing as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even milite in order to alleviate the suffering to come.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that the problems have become more significant due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was subsequently sent a few streets away, to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there’s a lot about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very suitable to parasite humans.
The reductions, as well as bed bugs, are nidical, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can very well believe that it is neither in their own interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples may choose to do an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations, but that also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, mushrooms, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage's DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to those who want to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, especially wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of information on the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transportation system based on passenger cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of the company and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why are transport systems generating such complaints, why are they breaking down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow because the conduct of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably coherent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be mathematically depicted approximately.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemeral flies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then much more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also issued the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that comprise a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil cutter.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A little like climbing a hill to a heavy carriage, dividing the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise up to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what makes people feel good or are attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues, from one of the ends of the spectrum being trying to remain “the right boyfriend” (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary action, conducting assessments, entrusting responsibilities, and holding others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she needs to change everything the group has created so far and do things in its own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can gather based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization becomes innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injuries, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and brain processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly connoted in science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been put into shelter in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class, and often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a great work of art while sitting with their classroom.
Participating practically on an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Every year, the site is updated, but the older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to know more about the world around them." The need to raise public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
“When used well, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical abilities and critical minds: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with that of others and express their own views on very specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas more north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent alone, regarding wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion has widely spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Road that connects Europe with India.
To the north, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they regard as harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the refusal of men's advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Blanca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
In the vicinity of the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, items of maroquinerie, narguilés and bibelots of all kinds, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located on the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano lava that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma needs to be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to travel in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Tombuctu” has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites at risk, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, this is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to get a Wild Card that gives access to some parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main point of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a glistening bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of the Victoria Harbor.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront in front.
The vast majority of Hong Kong’s urban development is concentrated on the northern shore.
This is the place that the British settlers invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence from the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed only of mangrove marshes; they also house some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about one-third of which are covered with water/sweeping areas.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 stained deer.
Buses depart from the interdistricts bus station (situated on the other side of the shore) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those that serve east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6.30am and 7.30pm.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboters, which are comfortable and robust.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing livelihood agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, survived primarily through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the giant province of India, was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, visit the Associacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a Sterling Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The Sterling Pound is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On neighboring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if UK and U.S. currencies may be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the rainfall is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, these are wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the momentum, the orignal, the bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sinked, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
The supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered during a peaceful gathering held in the city, during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most are shadowed by pohutukawas.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coastline. The swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the Number One, a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the Manta.
There are a lot of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef trips are done throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the meduses arrive near the beaches and river estuaries and can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would turn away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat lies in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveler the tranquility of knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or provide you with other documents needed for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the spot, and most consider this an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Remember that even though the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late in the evening at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the hut’s location, as the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers, with windows and clock rarely found, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them on site.
On some sites, it’s the locals who offer alcoholic drinks for free, but the drunkenness doesn’t alter judgment, and all good players know that it’s crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on the naked asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or powder or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and especially in the savannah, with the aim of attending the spectacle capturing wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lions, gepards and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also referred to as a “bush walk”, “hiking safari” or “footing”) consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may be facing a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes makes it easier to dry. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are no in the rooms.
If you don’t have an iron or don’t want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the tissue overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to do so for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated land from the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves prevail.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are pretty good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common here: apples are cooked and cooked in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often match particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to the regions.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.

The brackets are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security issue: indeed, the user's feet can stay stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stick, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most horsemen wear horseback boots with a smooth, narrow heel and sole.
Then some stools, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a trimmer to fall from the stool if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granitic cliffs.

The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This resembles alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel a bit longer distances than on foot – but you will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on dammed runways.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under conventional circumstances, travelling through several countries requires several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antique; some tax agencies define property over 100 years as antique.

Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of livelihood among the Samites and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.

Other examples are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinelle chain, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which culminates at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view on the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as by shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a Sabbath year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more of them choose this opportunity.

Finland is a destination of choice for marine sailing. The "Country of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Pleasure sailing is a national hobby in Finland, for a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from this, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one to forty).

This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only travel to land with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some pamphlets for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no tour of this city is included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flew before or experienced a traumatic event.

Transport companies are well paid for quick deliveries, and often, in the context of urgent repairs, the issue of deadlines is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air cargo, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
