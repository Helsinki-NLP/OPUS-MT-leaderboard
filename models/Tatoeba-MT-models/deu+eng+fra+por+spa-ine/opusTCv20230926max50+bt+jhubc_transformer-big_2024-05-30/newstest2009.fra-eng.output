At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange shifted in negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ stocks reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trades, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of stocks on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus also noticeable in us.
Shares fall in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index lost four percent during exchanges, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the drop to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock market lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to the index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about the U.S. rescue action will influence financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, chief of the Hong Kong monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk of the impact of other countries.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed support for the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč).
Legislators thus rejected the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a blood bath on Monday and the main stock indices experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it turned out that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress ceded: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be submitted to vote in the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not sure.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Said Sunday to Reuters agency Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, the plan should be submitted a priori to vote in the Senate on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "disillusion" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be on Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial companies unsold real estate assets that lead financial companies to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still have to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has significant impacts on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are making sure Congress reaches a definitive agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trades in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress’ decision could influence Monday’s trades.
For now, however, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by one or another problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still have numerous changes.
The total amount for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program does not fulfill its function, it has the possibility of blocking the award of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president can put his veto on this decision, Congress, he, has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finances for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the deduction agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program, and it sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides aid for real estate owners, who have trouble paying.
The government is expected to negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages it is going to buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and price of the repurchase of troubled assets will be.
This will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week on the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, Marek says, it is not so important.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, foreseeing the adoption of the plan, matters most right now," Marek said.
A pushed struggle to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually every mobile device can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive grammophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, that is, compressed music, to say in a simple way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty supporting headphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to play music and films, record the latter, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into consideration, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can toast meat and no television will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharges.
And playing music is one of the most important energy clusters.
There are rare mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this number is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, keep in mind that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this being valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including those with less performance.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited portion of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as drives are concerned, you do not need, except for iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and players will create a media library ranked by the performer's name, album title, style, or by the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, in the way of Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, you are especially interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is essentially for you, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile playing MP3.
Almost every mobile is able to do so today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
Everyone manages to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is one of the most widespread formats and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), however, is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical motive.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive for themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to pull the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy control.
Really anyone manages to control the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily match the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (the type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even considering the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can handle it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you’re among the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery lifespan (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missed for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz repeatedly that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who repeatedly stated that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is choiring with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer lucky (besides, now it would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a substantial decrease in prices, to which subsequently also the conventional operators had to react.
Yet, even before the entry of festivities such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those we hear today in Britain were being heard.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could be a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February, we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Let us add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be effective, they indeed need much fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are indeed exempt from relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators worldwide profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited offer of services.
For example, in Britain, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertising shot.
Indeed, this operator is specifically aimed at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, whether such a concept would be likely to work in our homes as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In Czechia, no chance, say mobile operators
Nevertheless, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechia the negotiations are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta Finance Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, has not hid its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for a long enough time.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future is perhaps promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"Right now, we don't think there's room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific in comparison with others.
For the time being, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project at the moment, which could serve as a basis."
"It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfillment of requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to build a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
What is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand themselves as thieves at a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon is also evidence of this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ during the creation of the U:fon was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Nowadays, the U:fon lends itself to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
“A virtual operator’s entry into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has a priori not shown sufficient interest for the conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
A statement made in this way would not be a surprise on the part of representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Moreover, as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile phone services."
However, putting pressure in the direction of an honest functioning of the market and a decrease in prices is apparently not part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which derives from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gasoline stations is probably due to the random and hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding liability for its behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are likely to lack even the telecommunications regulator,” Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should at least be concerning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are obviously doing the same.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility back on the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to introduce in the recently adopted telecommunications law an expansion of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised improvement in the situation.
The UOHS representatives must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When nobody looks, it can work
That said, the operation of some sort of virtual pseudo operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile phone services, but the latter are public only in part.
In most cases, it is a question of companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile phone services are for example offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic turn consists in the fact that the company performs in front of the operator the figure of a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special pricing (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you are talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would consider and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová responded to our question regarding this issue.
Nevertheless, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the heads of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them unnecessary profits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický states the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, nevertheless, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phones is not registered under their names, so they cannot fully dispose of it, as the ordinary customers of the mobile operators."
It is precisely this that should seem strange to ČTÚ.
Furthermore, there is another question to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to unveil such an activity, and if it does not wish to satisfy itself with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned repeatedly, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually every country where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators sought, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue like a hot potato that is being disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the shaft.
If the backstage information is true and a virtual operator will appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will hardly be able to remain impassible in the face of rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was recorded again by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choral performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to all four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek regards Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose to perform solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good dictionary, so that we could understand the lyrics well, that they would sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th birthday next year.
The song Kde domov můj sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des sautiers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the establishment of Czechoslaovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague’s public transportation (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik as the date on which the first passengers will get into the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a voucher 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it both registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můsltek, Letráží Holešovice, and Lužišovci.
From yesterday there is also the possibility of buying coupons online on the Dopravní podnik website: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can forget the ticket offices at the metro stations, where they had to hit long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (city libraries).
"At these contact points, there is a box office with trained staff at the disposal of the passengers, which will help those interested with the purchase via the internet and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Besides the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, they recall the tickets composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," added Opatrný.
An automaton will control the coupon in the place of the driver
Automates that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
In other words, in periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava, the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they determine the temporary and zone validity of coupons," explained the Filip Drápal ticket control of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of public transport in Prague.
The periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.

Sudetens call for a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Sudet Germans demanded that Šumava be incorporated into the United States.
This results from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vídecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This follows, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov prayed in the letter to the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed, "People to whom the fate of the Šumava is very important."
Given that the association with Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, regardless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take into his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed in no way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter wrote.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to hold, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be a part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, given the current knowledge of post-war history, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least assume that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted to such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed he would be expelled from the Republic following the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš <0xC5><0x98>ebíček’s office says it will discourage drivers from hazardous driving behavior.
This $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also witnessed by the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in large letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a flask of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay."
This must symbolize that one can afford a moment of carelessness from life.
The spots will "haunt" spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be commonly seen with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when roasting a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Signs signaling hazard to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static sign that warns against danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it anymore," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli provisional government, voted in favour of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied), if not all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will retain a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to yield to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not desire that tractors and bulldozers crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he subsequently stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also voted in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up their constant support to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia movement), Al-Kaida (the terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq.
Question that arises after the accident: Are stewards in the coach illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance coach is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency coach near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the coach during the journey.
"If one wants to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the coach.
At that time, the girl was sadly sitting next to the driver on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even abruptly brake, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing seat equipment is not approved, passengers must remain sitting.
The long-distance Student Agency coaches do not have standing seats; which was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the company director Radim Jančura.
"It's a matter that we dealt with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibited any travel of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transportation Act only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," said Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes that the law addresses the issue sufficiently.
"It all depends on the fact that the coach has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
Everything lies in it,” he said.
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and limited maximum speed, interurban with standing seats and higher allowed speed and long-distance coaches without standing seat with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in transportation, does not see the displacement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"When there is regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in aircraft.
Nor is it sure when turbulence will occur and the hostess can beat her head."
"In the event that the coach had suddenly braked, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he said and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
“But as soon as I feel like this is a risky trade, I will eliminate it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and journal at boarding.
This would also reduce the costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason for the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexey Litvine, who assures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We've been opposed to it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a deadly accident," he told Týden.cz a year ago.
An immense tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flash and blocked the way to the coach.
The latter's driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he sneaked him by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it will also rely on the culprit.
A change to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the travel of stewards on the coach.
“It has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the cell phone at the wheel," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards' activity to be a thing that would fundamentally jeopardize passenger safety," said Hanzelka, saying the control of coach safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Occupational Safety.
The hopes of the Dusseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB steering board to the employees of the house.
Through a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could form, according to the letter released on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled by sustained productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a decisive boost to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when an executive committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, wounded, is always under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has only recently made clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse clients through its investment funds, and WestLB has already been discussed for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether it be Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the groups of savings funds, commissioned the steering committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
Nevertheless, the talks have just started, it is said in the financial marketplace.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial square, has come into play as it is about consolidating the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Rhine-Palatinate Bank and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse had pronounced against any participation of Hellaba in the plans.
The other two houses did not join each other either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering board of Hellaba, had, however, opposed any commercial strategy of merging with its bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could come true first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers would increase, the potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 per cent of the capital of the Helaba, dropped a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB would remain rigorous.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely through which business model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be secured, had not yet been resolved by the German Savings and Transfers Group.
In the end, a breakdown of the WestLb could take place, which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter of the existing Executive Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' would be aimed at the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter can of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors of the beer party what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first hits Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel from Brazilians exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing old songs and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have gone to the beer party, already three layoffs alone this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending overnight would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a manager of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travelers sleep.
Better so, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates will once again make a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at six and thirty o’clock as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, wear a small yellow cap.
The top is written on the left `Beer Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: ‘When the doors of the beer chapter open, we run,’ Marco shouts early in the morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, says Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the repository!
`Show to security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Thirdly, `Tonight, I came back here ten and a half hours ago!' Understood?
And that's it, we went to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find the way, to signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the “weekend of the Italians”.
There are no accurate figures; we talk about 50,000 who set off through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a luck that the politician used the word “relatively” and that he slid that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This happened indeed this weekend.
Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side to the DAX, gets a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulences.
One person confident of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction it would be entitled to.
Money comes from as many private banks as from public-law banks.
In the background, it is the company-daughter Depfa who bears the losses.
The state financer had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since distrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had also fallen slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period in the previous year, the profits from the allocation of determined debts and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it was only due to the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the Tax Proceedings and Commercial Purchasing Book for Konzern companies that the profit deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financeer had initially poorly speculated on industrial real estate credits, which had subsequently been subsidiaries to Aareal bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, the Depfa had subsequently become more involved in infrastructure projects and funding joint private-public investor-state (PPP) projects and had been internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the group’s gains and losses a key material effect that still remains fairly blurred.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been cut to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been, since the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again changed considerably as the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually a short-term medium of refinancing for a portion - about 50 billion euros - of all of the Depfa loans.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of operation currently.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the executive board of HRE Georg Funke, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capability is now secured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have nothing but hope.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Furthermore, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday late in the evening, this at least temporary rescue will not be able to reassure the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While primary debts have barely moved, second-hand loan prices are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg daughter company Hypo and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the redemption of the Depfa bank.
As long as the less affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, it can be assumed that there will be a reduction in the amount of time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to expect right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching security has now become merely a founded hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights primarily for long-term creditors about deciding whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have traced on to constitute a postponement of losses for the next years on the next automatically collected equity earnings income tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to run for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
The way to school was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way on my own, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The start of courses does not seem to be as strict as we do in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a table round starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not at all like talking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mom, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slid in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she felt it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to whom better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, little sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruits and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope that she can get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangas is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach fleeing danger, does that mean that he also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how can we make sure that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without having proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hardly practicable grounds because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is facing a danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes the dead, leaks or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the direction and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of man: as much of his existence is linked to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is not allowed to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems to us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is next to another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
We could look at the processes of animal consciousness without taking into account their contents, and that's exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result of emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as the one of fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body's reactions) captures from living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the cortex and brain trunk, as does Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be involved in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think that is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could one nevertheless check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Indeed, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the cause of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations probably differ completely from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress on the nerve level is made insofar as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly beating myself against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at maximum speed," Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis said.
"UEFA is constantly on our eyes."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There would be a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league were convicted, already in the previous season, for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the league even had to be delayed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counter-attack
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulterian Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle – to everyone’s eyes and knowledge.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the U.S. newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and it was very painful."
She would have learned about the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it's told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clear: it would be "Monstrous," he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that "Meg once again rebounds the story of our relationship and manipulates it."
It would be more "sorry" if "the punishment and upheavals that a divorce brings for each child were once again revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his answer to the claw stroke: "At any rate, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found, following a price rise in the first quarter, a sharp decline in earnings in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already gone down in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was sharp, especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers were paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists."
Financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a 26.3 percent rise, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
Due to the rise in the price of petrol, economy class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, high fuel consumption, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economic class ticket prices dropped on average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, both in business class and first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided in two according to this study.
The reasons for this price drop would be a slowing economic growth on the one hand, the firm explains.
Demand would drop ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "open sky" treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of non-profit routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late into the game and his raised shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most had seated in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The practice was missing.
“It wasn’t very nice to see today,” later admitted Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have “would have been more relaxed as well.”
This 1:0 (1:0 in half time), the Hamburg team owed him to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional charts on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubted that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late-engaged arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen the debunked FC Bayern - certainly is slowly forming, but it is not yet shining.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little more.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock exchange index was 10,579 points with a decrease of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The most losing of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares declined by nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the financial company's shares that can be exchanged in correlation with the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States are not tackling investor concerns.
The price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the state's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank prices have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value at a time despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank blamed for a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid clearly below the substantial psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 Billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intends to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges have also known only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index reported a decline of 3.2 percent at the moment, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the top Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after a 1.26 percent increase.

In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational commercial and tourism company has also reported that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Due to the soon frozen fuel conduits, cryogenic death threatens.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing dismay among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravity support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what researchers have been astonishing for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is visible on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the abducted tourists in Egypt are expected to be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage killers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would have already be underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This was announced by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert tour are expected to be already on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the hostages were released remain blurred: thus, the kidnappers would have been near to end the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without screaming station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the officer said.
There was nothing left to collect the hostages,” when suddenly, “this surprise” occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "which led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges for indecent charges.
Truro's court of law referred that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, in his childhood, from five to seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an assiduous National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "has lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s beautiful father, who had written a letter of confession that ended as follows: “I bind him and bandais him regularly.”
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of seven.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I emphasize in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Defense Ministry man was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intention.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
“They will have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the resources of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing the B&B bill.
British building companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But interest rates that will increase at the same time will be charged, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is annoying to see that institutions that have been prudently behaving... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Trade Committee of Building Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have had prudent behaviour during the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We have to look at all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to adopt to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill,” Cole said.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could also double.
Since building companies are organizations without shareholders, their member ends up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five penny per liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced it would raise the wholesale price of its milk from five penny per liter on Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a research conducted by a consultancy company.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
Former PM of Bangladesh refused bail
A court in Bangladesh has dismissed a bail request to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to be arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her prosecution for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000,00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s ever-old rival, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give him his full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying it does not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to treat abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia denied the accusations they faced.
Concerns for the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent immunization campaign against polio because of Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she said she was unsuccessful in contacting children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A UN spokesperson said this has happened despite the Taliban’s promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission’s verdict, which would force it to reduce its share in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB of shares in ITV raised doubts about ITV's effective independence, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to cut its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All this was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the deletion of nine U.S. prosecutors in December 2006 by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that the prosecutors were fired because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others allegedly refused to investigate fraudulent voting charges against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical to Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," remarkably successful in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of failure to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honorable" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The evening of the awards is presented by Coldplay, with this year a selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly makes them part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking fifteenth.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English rankings for nine years, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf—or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name—has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal strings.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis and long-standing local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs through the north of First Street – not to be confused with Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty lane rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood ownership committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has requested a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only few spaces left belonging to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
"They might propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repay the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the manufacturer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary interest is to redress this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, emphasizing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further emphasizing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's many children's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The subsequent entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of ferrages, hails, barrels, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s luxury evolution, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be destroyed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Disputes: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow baggage, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a rust-iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the hoses."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agitatedly at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing shop.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown.
A few passengers said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he believed that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “are going on in dark, wet, and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think. Why middle classes need to be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports among so many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one-third of the students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 math State exam, expert level.
Likewise, nearly 93% of students passed the English-of-the-arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than Mr. Obama’s.
Sixth Street is based on analysis, practice, constant ability assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language instruction "full immersion."
Total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Should Mr. Obama not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools consisting mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he is favorable to the fact that immigrants are learning English, Mr. Obama recently regarded this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop controversy about the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he said, "You must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than despise them or consider them insignificant.
Oil Net Drop Following New Economic World Concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear the rescue plan in favour of the financial markets would be able to bring the economy back to life.
Futures of crude oil fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel, the New York Stock Exchange, on sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing a rise of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of deep uncertainties in financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the deal on the rescue plan, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by Congressional leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement "seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
“The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As for raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China.”
The bank's analysts lowered their expectations for next year, given the falls in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, oil and gas prices forecasts for 2009.
The Feast of the Second Determining Time for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played dirtyly in obscure clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, the precursor of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half-time.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his passing at Coles.
"He's a poor player"
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense was beating the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely set a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 advantage.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a time.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, "Second time or third time?"
When the two Jets were told they dropped 21 undisputed points in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeding its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to race 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his 2:04:26 record by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his superb career, during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at departure, 55 at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, have contributed to a decrease in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, having suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missing training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I put myself back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better.”
He was blamed – especially in Kenya, the rival is African from Ethiopia – for having too much to orchestrate his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, relying on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background runner.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not take part in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 miles and a half afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City at Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black town to be integrated, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today." The town with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become touristic thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tour guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston was telling that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the eyes of foreigners.
“We’re very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-standing resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historic model of a black takeover of power and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere, dialect-filled books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten central Florida, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold like a big box in life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was subsequently divided into several private parts.
"Passing the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of beverages and everything that can serve the passengers."
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t actually a portrait that everyone enjoyed.
Zora has described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls whom Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a living and eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many mocked her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he adds further, swinging in his chair from the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-way motorway into the city, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way street of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixture of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white young people came to throw oranges or objects against people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
“A lady has even died.”
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorious of my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black kids used to be kissed - I remember - our master was kissed in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Chief Executive Officer of the Eatonville Community Backup, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
That exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began struggling to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just when Eatonville's most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began to host a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s inauguration two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the contee rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, true civic pride," Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd summarized the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (renamed obviously Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time regard itself as a rear back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Now we have 90 percent of black people.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
It is necessary to ask permission for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
In particular, young people tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston regarded his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, busy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, which need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people, who pass through this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city hasn’t compared anything to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after the mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone talks fluently about finance.
However, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were standing away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York spend the worst "working day" at the office since the 1929 crack.
Shippers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their chariots and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always drag between residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke laid on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street dealers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, as I was finding out at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, about twenty people in queue.
Not in front of the cashier’s box offices, nor to withdraw the cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service box, where regular customers ordered their cheque books, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all queuing for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank, has resorted to the bankruptcy syndic, and as New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another $440 million savings bank, Wachovia, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the shop employees in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, or the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket speaking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
“I have changed, I don’t want to take a risk.”
Muslim graves profaned while Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecration of an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could somehow be linked to the elections.
A spokesperson from the Islamic local community said she was “profoundly shocked” at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that is nearing its end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its right-wing oscillation in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, who scored almost 30 percent of the votes, led an anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were even considered xenophobic, according to critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against wearing scarves and burkas, and even expressed opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections defined the extreme right as the country’s strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamour rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that controlled it, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent Police granted this travel ban last Thursday after proving the judges Glitter’s guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the limited court hearing in Ashford, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said, “Thursday, September 25, in the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, although he was registered on the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his moves to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any particular cases or potential displacement of Glitter in the account.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, “The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those abroad.
"We think it's easier to monitor someone who's staying in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after purging 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took a plane to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board for a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited jurisdiction court of Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been serving a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers from intimate gestures and stolen eyes artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixed in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you do not need to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a personality.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars.”
In 1997, Bauer began a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, remember classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "Music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic was the constant of this work presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has turned into an antology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a moment or so.
In photography, portrait is the hardest genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don’t know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I still try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of Rue de la Mata (parallel to the Hercules Street), which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown topics, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning favorite confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the novel that currently occupies it "is a true boldness" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the majority of the participants, made a full hall at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The intense presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the hour spent in the work of the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences";
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," noted Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "leaves less like people" because they were asked to "to go."
Bad weather spoils the fair of Pozoblanco
The flag party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning after horseback riding toreaders checked that the arena was unpracticable.
In this way, the organizational committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was harsh on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the planned second bull race.
On the poster were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have competed in the Castilblanco arena.
Thus only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the gradins discovered applauded more than his battle in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without difficulty or glory.
In his battle with the second bull, after a much better battle, he was whispered by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune of Armiñón (Alava).
Police arrest two occupants in a van and the latter two take the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, to stop them.
Police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were carrying out vehicle checks on the N-1 at the Armiñón Commune border.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
Police began pursuing until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further downside, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with ballots of hashish, and then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and drug weighing.
Furthermore, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" as it did not match the one written on the gray card of the van, which is why they also charged the inmate with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to flee and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The inmate, 28-year-old A.A.J., was arrested to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her maneuver strangely while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a California police patrol spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
That person, at the time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the abuse of alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although "According to the police officers' observations at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested suspected of driving under the effect of an unspecified substance that was incarcerated around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
Gaspar Llamazares, Coordinator General and Member of the United Left, said today that it was the regional federation to make a decision on the case of former Seville Municipal Youth and Sports Counsellor Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out favourable treatments to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said in a statement on the behaviour of the political party that will have to adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all officials.”
"Blood of May," Garci's daring bet
Based on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, Sangre de mayo, will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he realized with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd of May in Madrid, which he always accepted when the narrative was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was wrong as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated throughout almost his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a Empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, the stage stage of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shoot and with whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to stay informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times nominated for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominated films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of Mayo," "Seven French Billiard Tables," and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers," are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re just making an extra movie,” Garci says after over 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Seville dancer will pay tribute to a dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe during the mid-wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "We are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dance was identical to hers,” she said.
The stage was directed through two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with her student.
Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The stage was also directed by the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viol of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal genre".
This work also relates, in some ways, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so distant, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to recall it because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or emphasizes his work,” says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triannate Zenobia and Juan Ramón commé" (2006-2008).
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennate" comes to an end with the re-publishing of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and who, after travelling to the various provinces, traveled from International to New York.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most well-known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Evil," and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer from this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
It hasn’t been working since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds every expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are scary, Americans’ esteem has fallen very low, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his eldest deceased following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicide food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us high," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from goals.
This is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though the opportunities were not missing to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside of my house if I have a bifteck in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to see his daughters meet with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been so proud as that of the devoted husband, the loved father, the careful grandfather and philanthropist,” he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can hold the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a qualifying score.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the removal of the backpacks, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They were taking you there only to take the backpack (first error, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small sized jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we hadn't left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting of more than 40 minutes during which rebellion and assaults took place in the barrack.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this would not come to my mind.
So I believe we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) in response to what was asked when a company was asked for.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for the understanding of both computer hardware and software.
It holds the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the “death” of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I will show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft's employee-owned rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the Association of Muscled Gays.
And if we started listing all of his apparitions, we could also cite this mustache stroke raising weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a cotton, moulded, sleeveless men's body jersey.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out from all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have in their neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz take their new fashion activity very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera Dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis for your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are inspired a lot for our collections.
I really like walking around the city and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little I enjoyed clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you take on the clothes, that's when you really get into the skin of the character.
All of a sudden, everything is linked.
You didn’t have 30 years ago: Was it hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was young and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to do so and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the movies ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what you'll think about it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go on the bridge to make the model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for a long time, to invite me to participate in London at a charity parade for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were being auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Driving Alcohol Recurrents Will Have to Install Alcolock System
The Minister of the Interior wishes that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol in the blood, must install a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting in a drunk state or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced in June and is now reflected in the Minister of State's report in which the initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, as well as the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, the car takes over.
The alcohol would avoid this since it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This is due only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but, however, reform done by criminal means requires reform of organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental purposes.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m. the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling was landing in the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset, but its rays still forced it to put its hands as a sight so that it could see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you out of here or else...?
- No, no, sir, I'm a Spanish, but I've lived here thinking about two years.
- Oh, okay.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is very soberly dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told him that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official courtage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious award of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost emotionally crying about it.
It is certainly the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, chairman of the jury of the competition, made us encounter a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With as its next table that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Heavy on his heart and doing good luck for the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a mango clothing and some adornments of ELAH, which were breathtaking, and arms on it, arms down with her son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters tall - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galant man, and Baron de Rotchil ended the night without a jacket because they had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself in the shop with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner changed into a long, sexy and black dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and remembered the good old time.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her cell phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his linens, towels and having asked in advance that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The wake-up caller almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that life today imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to fight daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
Yes, 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from the yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods tailored to each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' deny such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time that happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign disorder of sleep called somnilochya.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there are more than one speaking at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (peeping in bed) or sleeping, but this is not always the case.
As we said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful or overexcited situations.
Anyway, this is a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet little voice, in isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with cries, crying, long speeches...
In case sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a mild disorder, which is why there is no treatment unless it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepines appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
This is useless because he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will not obtain anything, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
Also, you’ll hear what he says, but you won’t know what he’s dreaming about, so pay attention to how you’re interpreting the information and the conclusions you’re drawing from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night for his secrets.
Not even by joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Ilhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of lack.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Blacks created the greatest number of occasions and managed to turn one for the winning of the match.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was nearing the chandelier on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and turn-by-turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Roman from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to chew the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving Riahi moving at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the butcher Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Ilhousian Eleven who just stepped back a little to "compact" her defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big camouflage, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a tour of Brittany.
Faced with the force demonstration of fishermen who severely disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet with their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the “crisis committee” created by the British fishermen to obtain measures against the rise in diesel prices, which reached a record average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been launched on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the dock, or to Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and du Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the major refinery Total de Donges in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
At Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not wish to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, are currently paying about 50 cents per liter, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel oil of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer tables out of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are hovering on the global economy.
The world’s fourth aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have ransomed, is planning to cede more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the U.S., the newspaper quotes sources close to the case.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets AIG plans to separate include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been made on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly earn cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Session history Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused of a historic drop Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unseen loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest decline in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the banks' rescue plan that was meant to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 to, the representatives refused the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relyed on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late."
“If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will quickly pass to the Fed (the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza said.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury voucher declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday night, and the 30-year voucher to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Obama wins the first TV duel
In Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, another one succeeded to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that was allegedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls at five weeks of the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% against McCain 44%), believes it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the indecisive voters, which are the ones that count, Obama came out to be the winner for 39% of the surveyed, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his advance Thursday with the expected good performance of his packer, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts,” Clinton said this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to highlight his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused repeatedly.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack has been hammered since yesterday in Republican TV advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without dismantling, he was concise and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain hasn’t yet understood, while Obama does,” said a Democratic spot this weekend reproaching the Republican for not taking the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “Street American.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama wrote yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle-class" or "workers." The financial overthrow clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still succeed in reducing taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street shocks, Illinois also noted that achieving potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his top priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain planned to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates prudently avoided questions concerning the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night as soon as polling stations closed in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some admit they didn’t even vote, “What good, because they will do what they want with my voice,” said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown good value to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were considered clean by observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the stripping," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislation proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, comes into crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process would recognize the validity of the poll.
She stresses that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the pre-vote (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“Did you notice that there was an election, do you?” questioned the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozuline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls back on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Interview - Blood Becomes Safe Again
Héma-Québec was yesterday celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec has become one of the world’s safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And above all, he regained public trust that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public groan, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, in February 1994, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in Quebec's blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground over the years that followed, we regained public trust,” she said before proudly claiming that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary notes that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of crazy cow disease were witnessed in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been the stronghold since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, that when it is not known and that a serious disease may result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it has been shown without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle applied was meaningful."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not antibodies to the virus, on which the tests used to date were based.
TANs have shortened the mute period, which spans between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk of some donors being infected unknowingly and unable to be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means it will have to distribute 12 million blood products before anyone gets infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health,” says the chief executive officer of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Decary continues before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide adequate supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
However, any healthy person aged 18 years and older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
"Because today's life is so awkward, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and it is planned to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing for transplants early next year,” said Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many moms are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first division qualifying series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, in the second and decisive quarter-final game of the series in total goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first goalless half on both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, suburbs of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
Canada's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the dam fire against the Florida Panthers last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two helpers, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest placed on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected on the occasion of today’s partial election.
"Removing the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of picture mill.
Three huge screens featured spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the electoral period.
At a press briefing, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this autumn, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, amounts of investment, or a specific priority in future projects.
At the most, a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it ours, but it is within us,” he insisted, as well as to show that he was seeking a national founding myth.
Quebec has built itself a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
"There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity comes, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role has begun.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” but a time when “a common vision will be given to oneself.”
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought otherwise to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in the Adelard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party was able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press point, he invoked another, conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stressed that it is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
“It remains between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, sparking nourished applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a poll this autumn, as the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is fulfilled, however, notably by a federation council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished that Quebec appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they had a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its application.
If he had done so, "we would have been more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the poll that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who comes from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
Thus casting the shame on this woman who fought an endless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says so much about the Prime Minister’s entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only of all the Western countries involved not to have repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he was accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its word and allows a child-soldier to be crouped under inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
For a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to have a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of extortion.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper is constantly sweeping and sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, imprisoned arbitrarily according to the good will of a head of government so far minority (what then after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Chairman of Canadian mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, cashless publishing house with the aim of launching a “transparent public debate.”
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to lead a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defense and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost bottomless of the mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will scourge the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to turn to the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas and not with a snare.
Thus, it was enough for the mining to open up its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada from the back of the hand.
Perhaps could Mr. Garver explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while despising the opinions of the same public?
In the Vice-President world, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it primarily because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a pursuit-bail (following the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a warning to the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that dislike the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long managed debates and disagreements and resolved conflicts.
Barrick Gold's oversized pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
It includes: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right to look at wages paid to managers of rescued businesses.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Chair Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done in such a way as to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing Wall Street crisis,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, trauma, chaos and disturbances in American daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned the sprint in recent hours because of fear of the effect that a further failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed upon was the opening of the markets this morning.
Late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election showed themselves rather favorable to the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that we were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has awarded himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one that allows owners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of the executives of state-run companies.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no welcome.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The broad lines I have read show that this is something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsellable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a liquidity freeze and bank debt.
It was a group of Republican voters who had the first bill of agreement overturned last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first $250 billion tranche, which can be added to another $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in rescued companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to sell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure proceedings for housing attached to the housing loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and starting allowances to the managers of the affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Obviously Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's finance committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not that of taking advantage of taxpayers.”
An animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize laureates, wrote to tell us: Congress is asked not to rush and to carefully examine the path to go,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its shipwrecked competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the U.S. real estate loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, we get a voting right in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and households enjoy now that the weather is announced uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank ill-run by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all ongoing loans at Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government is expected to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Engaged Icon
Her beauty in the blue eyes was for a long time her asset card, some will say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His humility, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have him away from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the break-up of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without an exaggerated ego, ultimate brand of quality.
For in him was projected a whole country enthusiastic about the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television, and soon in cinema.
This same man who milited for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the splinters of the show-business, of which we will not have quite perceived the enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance caused dizziness to the film fans this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories intersect.
More than half a century of an ever-changing seventh American art marches through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an adapted burning roof by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many more Paul Newman went into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic fool in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for Best Movie in 1973.
Bitter pool player and vengeant in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will resume the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Again, he.
Epochs move through his journey.
The young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mafia's sponsor in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends that left the trade early enough, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his golds, his pride and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles for a long time fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the early young than the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, traced a feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of humility and sadness.
Among the rain of tribute yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former armsman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drifts, also wiped out.
Many will have seen his bind throne on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of pretty bad taste, although gag initially.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to its Foundation for Children in Distress.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company manufacture well in their invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearings concerning the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of continuous and regular criminal organization scams, resulting in particularly serious harm, and other charges have been held against them, such as forgery and use of forgery.
According to the prosecution, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the cashiers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to obtain the money from grants obtained by issuing fee invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided, and thus the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they purchased bill books from the Józsefváros market, while they made the seals in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they were carrying out the other invoices they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracing circuit", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
Based on the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert, which will subsequently bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, was filled with form and background errors.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
Invoice issuers with overwhelming imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill there were one hundred people staying there, also did not stick, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which have not as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time.”
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about the travel agencies in Budapest, which were part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad, so they naively indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp at the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>rt was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the false ones were written by hand.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning goods transport by road as a service, which the invoicing company could not exercise, given that its profile was the investment advisory.
In addition, it was also for vices of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued at the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports stage in Kunfehértó, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when Fiatal Városért Egyesület's group was supposed to have a meal at home.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were quite aware that they were asked to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal group - Ifjú Szocialisták, has issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue fake invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HU.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the CEO of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose headquarters was in Budapest but where he was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment for approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly submitted documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, and that he pocked their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generació.
Kubatov gave agencies, a total of 15 invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért filed an application for a grant with the socialist party's public utility organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictional invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these invoices were found during the search at the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making invoices, as they had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or possibly the socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of much of the fifty million HUF, Zusi alone would wear the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be harassed, since applications for his placement in house arrest, on the basis of a relief in his detention conditions, continually fall into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least await the end of the proceedings at their own home.
The Psychology of Bidding: Why We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distant in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay an overpriced price.
This research tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-auction of a third, the ensemble under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensely when losing the game.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
This is why, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers pursued financial supervision analyses.
Three groups were bidding against a partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus made their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would get an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received the $15 prior to the auction, the group members also lost that money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that one focused on victory, while the other focused on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the players' team "against failure" were willing to make higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena seen during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When Should We See a Doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that in Hungary there are one hundred thousand patients carrying the hepatitis virus, but only seven thousand are undergoing treatment because of the fact that often the patients do not know that they are carrying the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and generated diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowness develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become lighter and the urine becomes darker. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys the liver cells in a deceitful way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are around 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis type C.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing to what extent belief in God could influence human tolerance for pain.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
Specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained manner, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Hermine Lady painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers who originated this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 four-part electroshocks successively, while watching either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
Catholics declared that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "secure," as someone whom we "care" and they "calmed, and peace invaded them."
In view of the religious theme painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they watched Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided they find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary cause better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that you can find him at the bottom of the people's pocket just like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their vacation, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
This is not enough, however, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
While skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the essentials of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to meet their initial goal that sounded like, “Let’s collect in one system all the information of the world!”
According to the Google leader questioned, after ten years of global shift work, they are still only the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be the best for me?" However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages visited by the interested persons are accurately listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program registered based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit to us products and services based on our previous statements.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask the users, who are worried about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or possibly the revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most remarkable example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users may have sighed a sigh of relief last May, when Google, armed down with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court to the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the Constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, whatever the nature.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won compared to the strengthened Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier, but ultimately it failed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords in the past two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is bullied by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services, so they attack them in the spirit of revolt manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wildness" bringing together enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists and users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "branched corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even if both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, facing the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most pronounced keyword of recent years, is just drawing behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 concerns nothing but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave footsteps behind us, and we use the communication channels available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can automatically link these to a recent chase system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold more blogs, in which they appear on their stocks.
While we can see many examples, such as the one of the girlfriend who easily understands at the view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the one of the company that fired one of his employees, only for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be on a term of life:
The person who lives a life online is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do so (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google's online services, from text processing to image processing, to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which have not been attached to our largest parks and servers that exist.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten advertising agencies’ revenue, while the services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only from Microsoft, but from others.
However, critical Chinese observers find, next to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the Chinese business kindergarten, and after the company has found the daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken anytime.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the previous services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, our medical system will make the world move on new points. While some think that the project of scan and archiving of books and magazines from Google takes such important dimensions that the company will soon be facing the Sup.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached scaryly just through Google’s data.
Two miners helped remove traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police have summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the dual homicide in Ózd. According to grounded suspicion, they have helped to remove the traces of the crime," said the Borsod Department police station spokesman.
The young people have recognized the facts they are accused of, and for now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, defend themselves freely.
Murder complicity can lead to detention of up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of 23-year-old Ozd was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and for interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owes a huge amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt and for this reason he brought his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as this man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the ITM, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the redemption of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech krones, to buy 100% of the stock package from the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal made by the Poles despite previously excluding the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic newspaper E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer ever made for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the newest worst owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech krones by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, about 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, leading newspapers in the European press already mention a "September 11th".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president," accuses the daily La Repubblica of Rome. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at rescuing a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the goat in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo’s vision, it was the failures of political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and afterwards the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real danger threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, notes the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still provide a rescue buoy to their titanizing financial agencies, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such dominos, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need that the states of the European Union take little into account their national selfishness, and that they centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial agencies received more than 100 billion euros - the Viennese daily Der Standard recalled, adding that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands at the pocket, very deeply similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses part by part the old continent.
The "savers" should not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise to note in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bourbon
Which method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, other than the imitation of a barrier detector already existing in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the strategic starting point to Nissan engineers to inspire them on how to design the next generation of barrier detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C self-roboted controlled system, which it has equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee makes up its own oval-shaped space, which in reality resembles our secure protective shell - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the brand's research and development department and technological public relations.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is capable of seeing in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters from the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which transforms it into an immediate avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it weren't so, the mini auto robot wouldn't be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacle," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration as well as slowdown as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lighter lithium polymer batteries with a higher energy concentration, which makes their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is primordial, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process and react to a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We do not need memory for gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will enter mass-made cars in the next 10 years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying back banks’ dubious loans, and to use in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further debates that continue until midnight, Saturday, local east coast time, Congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have been in existence for days and days around the $700 billion rescue plan.
“We have taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the American House of Representatives, according to which the agreements have to be put on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still have to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question of rescuing Wall Street here, but of turning the economy in the opposite direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 pm Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., depending on Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that responds to the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are satisfied with the advances achieved tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Furthermore, the programme differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion should be spent at once, to buy back securities on dubious loans.
From now on, a maximum of half of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the bill is passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used to the Treasury Secretary to purchase dubious debts from banks, while the use of the additional 100 billion dollars will be left at the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious debts, securities on dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The department’s competent persons have stated that the redemptions can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the vast redemption of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system causing the collapse of any major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary arrangements to be ready for law enforcement as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in poor positions awaiting state aid can expect their departure allowances, called simply a golden over-Atlantic parachute, to be capped by the government.
The wage ceilings are mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat provides assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury secretariat purchases through an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of dubious debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the picture to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in force regarding appointments of directors-general - commented Chairman of the Committee in charge of the House of Deputies' financial benefits, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide how losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why the American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Mary Kaptur, a Democratic colleague from Ohio, believes that it is the same people who press for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a substantial monthly rise in prices in the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and appliance manufacturing (0.9 percent), as well as a minimum increase in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry saw a rise, between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supplies sectors, representing a significant role in domestic industrial operations, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of rising gas prices put in place by authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector had the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important field of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases have occurred in the textile and textile manufacturing sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases evolved between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
Throughout the processing industry, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 percent of the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to sector allocation, in August, the earnings-on-initiator sectors showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials production sectors for subsequent processing did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials production sectors for subsequent processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Industrial export prices, in HUF, rose 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment method weakened by 1.7 per cent from the euro, and 7.1 per cent from the dollar; compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent from the euro and 15.9 per cent from the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the U.S.-Hungary Visa Waiver Agreement will come into force by 12 January, as the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now everything depends only on the time when the electronic over-Atlantic entry and control systems will be put into service.”
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will confer the Order of Merit Cross decoration with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the $700 billion government rescue plan, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday morning, that they have concluded principle agreements on the banks' rescue plan.
This funding plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the highlight of economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as collider just after the Republican convention, has melt.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly vote on the $700 billion rescue bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
“It is now that we must act, with responsibility ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the industrial sectors as a whole and the stability of the entire economy,” he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He has not failed to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentions the establishment of a Treasury Control Commission and the ceiling of departure allowances for senior leaders, and that he is personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role on the background in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Chair of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press journal of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is what Der Spiegel evokes, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, a process that was likely to be completed just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party has ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace, but secularization, educational results and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical, and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it was precisely the classical groups of citizens who have moved rather away from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, undergraduate holders and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU dropped below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the reserve to the issues of the coalition", the Austrian Conservative daily deals with the situation of confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open to negotiations and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, party leaders barely let their maps be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted with caution to the proposals of the Reds.
As he already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or joining the coalition is momentarily an open question, which must be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, has begun as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People’s Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and thus one of the main obstacles to their life’s success.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of MEP Fidesz's People's Party, Járóka warned that in addition to the distinctions found during the hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their poor qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma have no high school degrees, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a graduate degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as an elementary human right plays a key role in enforcing other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in a broadest circle possible, also between Roma and non-Romans.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be secured their right to a quality education, and protected by a low quality and sectarian education," said Járóka.
According to the MEP, a collaboration of the European Union oriented towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools, for which compliance with existing anti-discrimination guidelines in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as citizens of full right in the future of Europe," said Járóka.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" assured for all, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held every year since last year's Berlin Summit, is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, targeted at European and Member States level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the fallen Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party president Erwin Hube and the head of regional government Günther Beckstein can still retain their place. The question is, how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, made it feel that they were not especially attached to their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to soothe the furious members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU has been Bavaria’s “only sovereign” giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still rely heavily on this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tasteful discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as the eventual coalition with the Free Electors, trained along the right-wing values, about a right.
A strange foot of the fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of a coup perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, to then carelessly deal with the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, somehow or other, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been drawing the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role.The former regional government chief and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, which he believed would have deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor once again if they resume in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence Berlin’s great coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis lasts forever.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
None of the opposition members have accessed Belarus’ parliament after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the vote collection.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well from opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODZ) 2006 seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in doubtful elections, would "put on the trail of"
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order of gases, which is classified as antidemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking Russian politicians are always receiving no entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the prohibition of running for one-third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were taken.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political detainees have returned to freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backward, but the most important thing is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU," Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that “the power in this parliament that has no weight has been afraid of bringing even one opponent in.”
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in view of the results, but rather is trying to send its message about the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we must have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put us sticks in the wheels for broadcasting, but I can also find that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly considers," said Milinkevitch, referring to his main fact that the security no longer in the current regime.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace had we had turning doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the little smart ones, against whom it points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-laziness novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The turning doors,” Brunetta says, “are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta further emphasizes.
The installation in all the establishments of the Council Presidency is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General says: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
"In three months, the absences of illness of public employees have decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year."
And he adds that it is essential to make the public administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics have doubled over the past 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and far beyond inflation rates," explains the minister.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
"while the Minister of Public Service today spreads data on the decrease in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," writes the Consumer Association- the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service is challenged; the extension of the schedules of the sick worker's residence at home, during which check visits are carried out; as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people remaining permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Work Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Disabled of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his " sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of accidented workers, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness".
"Everyone, naturally outraged, has beat a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to under-assess the social severity alarm, to apply and improve legislative standards.
Chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini emphasized how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to quickly end it."
The data of the accidented workers seems to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘discount trend’ to actually translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
“We said that more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this from school.”
- He added that "there is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "derived assistance to which the system is oriented in recent years."
“The aim, therefore, is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance in such a way that the fate of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator.”
Mp3 player pointed to the finger, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission announced, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” said Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow up on new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intense use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists concluded that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents against noise exposure from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is a growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to properly limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.E.
Rome, Alemanno gave orders to send the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“The committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it – underlines Alemanno – it will have to propose ideas for Rome’s development to be used by political decision-makers, who remain the committee and the communal council.
No overlapping of roles, but only the willingness to have a corner to elaborate a big project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and will then disappear, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June, announcement by the Mayor, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, to a deeper prospect, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.”
Furthermore, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost one euro to Roman citizens, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences expressing the Capital.
For Alemanno, indeed, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither farm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a united spirit, ".
A future that, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pretend to be independent wrote, “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relationships (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really culotted: he believes he will win the highest role of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the southern bowels of the United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting box, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
Here is an aspect of the American mentality that is kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home kicked in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge spot to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of paper newspaper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists have been interrogated by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Almost all journalists are pessimist about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the attached to the information, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at assembling newspapers, are a major problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if it is desired that traditional journalism as the general public hears it, be reduced substantially.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six in ten senior executives and printing newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses make a shift to the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer" of newspaper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to engaging in technology hoping that it “does something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crook in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level believe that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the “security of work”.
Directors who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large wages, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “ill” during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAURATE GROOTTAFERRATE.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the proceedings of real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During the trial at his charge last week, he had obtained home release transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence his society and have access to evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the House of Representatives voting, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and are even, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which made itself feel despotic with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only an example of the changes, of the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake already announces or lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and maybe not only here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been overwhelmed for some time, to the extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary recovery, of the double sovereign state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost only national here.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide on any common political line.
And thus, it is the government of each State that all await interventions, rescue and revival plans, new rules, and above all a affection of credit: when one goes through a difficult period, it is only the States that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar manner.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the always major importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have realized in one shot, that our future will have to settle its accounts with things quite little material as water.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a restricted space, to a territory.
Thus, he who is sovereign certainly possesses more cards than he who is not, that is, he who is unlucky to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more strange to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and of the traditional political orders, which manifest itself in the "revolts" of improvised electoral or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter late, from the conservative ascension in Austria to the fall of the Greater Bavaria.
It seems that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, somebody would say, are always having more difficulty in understanding and thus representing the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis increases, increases and agitates potentially overwhelmingly.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is well said, keeping your eyes open, that is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spider-Man.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centers, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in doing so.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued on a vertical wall.
The U.S. journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called nano-carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adhesive.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it is “easily detached from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s faculty of engineering.
MARK ON WALLS? –" This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nanotubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to finding a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive formed from microfibers like hair, which self-cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: Never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are dealerative and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ongoing in Philadelphia, he brings a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and pomegrants for their healthy.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized because it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Agency for the Medicines itself, which reported the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take drugs such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is a list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan: "These findings are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of medicines if necessary.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the medications that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not being impressed, but speaking clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert said to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked by how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high value economist,” but also a very aggressive “style discloser, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the “anti-Microsoft” package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost one year of work, done by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with a variety of novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to others more important, such as ISO compatibility born for the Apple operating system Mac OS X, and the Op O support for the new format.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic design module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of the Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or text developer.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about modifications, in text development, because each employee is assigned a comment color for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is, as usual, available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freedom can be a way to spread it to homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the following is trying the great challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we will even be able to exceed the expected figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey for the best climber.
It is the newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl tests are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positiveness of the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to forcefully expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian stood on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus running the jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES ASKES IF ITALIA IS RACISTE?
Italy "as an emigrant country has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times, which devoted a long article debating the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies, is interested in this.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both the ones where "more integration and more work is recorded", but also "a strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal citizens is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
"Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church should work together to overcome racism."
Students suffering from expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market does not have a crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the extent that it excludes entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support," explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has started them.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the inquiry in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we range from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied for Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the towns evoke the historic halls.
Historic cinemas close in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates well what is happening in the great urban centres of Italy, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of large multirooms on the outskirts, and the death of consumption of monorooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and indisputable; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historic places and loaded with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of way and so many emotions for always" can be observed by the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, which offered to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of a Cannes jury.
The figures provided by Anec, the main merchant association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have mostly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is at the top with 82 mono cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, since it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still be guaranteed the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these friends are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexs.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit to merchants: the state’s previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Notice the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historic centers and peripherals.
Among the standards provided are tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the limited traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and some parking lots.
"I like this initiative," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
However, it is obvious that to contrast the super power of multiplex, traditional rooms also need to improve the sound and image quality, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" to which I was already thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the signs blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniform the choices of the town hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavy accusations are being made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted for association of mafia criminals, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"Affliction to legal and moral norms, and especially common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially within the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration."
The president of the regional committee of Calabria, Agazio Loyero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the andrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow those in July, after which police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April last year, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditionalities between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administration of the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused Deputy Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to demand the change of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, emerges the "availability to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are thrown.
This is an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that colossuses like Chevron have looked at and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmentalists and the further increase in oil are giving the sector a major boom.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of global electricity needs could be covered by seawave operating systems.
This amount would be twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colossus in the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are focusing on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, and it’s evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to operate marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which are moving the energy path from the sea, and the sums invested to this day, although their details are not known, observers say, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its early stages, for instance the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which causes the sludge to move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the float.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under sea.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves the potential of tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable by wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look toward the coast, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and forecast investments up to $35 million in 2009.
