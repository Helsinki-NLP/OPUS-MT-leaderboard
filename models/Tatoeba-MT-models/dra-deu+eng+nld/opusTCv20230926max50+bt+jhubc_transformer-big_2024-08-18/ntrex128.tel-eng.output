Welsh AMs are worried that 'it's like muppets'
Some AMs were shocked by the suggestion that they should change their title to MWPs (Welsh Parliamentarians).
The problem arose because of the idea of converting the Assembly into a Welsh Parliament.
The AMs of all the political parties are worried whether this will cause any disturbance.
“It’s like Twp and Pwp,” said a Labour AM.
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means low intellect and pwp means feces.
A Pledge AM said that the whole of our category was “not happy”, as well as they suggested some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that we were "positive" of the name change, but that MWP was an indicator for Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the U in Yorkshire English.
According to the new law, "the decision on how the members of the Assembly are to be summoned will be ultimately in the hands of the members."
In 2017, the Welsh Assembly passed a law authorizing the Welsh Government to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the referendum it had gathered, according to which the majority of the population supported the name Welsh Parliament for the Assembly.
The Commission on the A.M. title favors Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the majority of the public opinion supports the MWP.
AMs have suggested alternative names, but it has been a big headache for Elin Jones, the presiding officer who had to submit a draft law on changes in a few weeks, to reach a consensus.
The Reforms Act also included disqualification of AMs and other changes relating to the functioning of the Assembly in addition to the Committee System Design Rules.
When there is a debate about the law they have the right to vote finally on how to call the AMs.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country's name
People will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote is being held to find a solution to a decades-long dispute with the region of Macedonia in neighbouring Greece.
Athens has long been concerned that a neighbouring country in the north, based on their name, is attempting to occupy an area of their country, preventing them from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
President Jorge Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, say the name change will give them the opportunity to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are ringing in Harlem due to the difficulties of the churches
"The elders who spoke to me told me that, according to history, there would be a bar and a church at every turn," Adams said.
Today, they don't."
He said he understands the power of branding.
He said: "People's lives have changed.
"People don't go to bars often these days."
When it comes to churches, where leaders feel that selling assets can't last long with the money coming in, he said, "it'll be back soon."
Because of the demolition of churches and the construction of huge buildings, people who enter the apartments may overlook the surrounding holy places.
"The apartments in these buildings are mostly bought by the white people," he said, "and since most of those who come into these apartments are not members of the churches, the day is near when all of these churches will be closed."
The two churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis a decade after St. Martin became a metropolitan community in 1870.
In the 1930s, the original White Methodist group moved out of the area.
The blacks who were praying nearby took control of the building.
Under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, blacks took control of St. Martin, who marched on 125th Street, the main street in Harlem, to ban retailers who refused to hire blacks or hold high positions.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, so Father Johnson's parishioners ordered Carillon to rebuild the building.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, a successor to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor."
The expert who carried the carillon in July said of it: "Cultural wealth", "unmatched historical device."
According to Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, the first carillon played by a black musician in the world was Dianesia A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriwether said no one else was appointed in his place at St. Martin's Church.
For the past few months, only the sounds of architects and contractors have been heard in St. Martin, some of whom have been brought in by lay leaders and others by episcopal dialysis.
In July, the Parish Oversight Committee, which met with lay leaders about the disease, Westry wrote that the disease was attempting to "collect costs from them" even without their involvement in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the disease.
Some have complained about the lack of transparency in the Diaspora.
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a shark attack in California
Authorities said a shark injured a 13-year-old boy who went to catch lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacons Beach in Ncinitas around 7 a.m.
Chad Hamell, who spoke to KSWB-TV, said on Saturday morning in San Diego with friends that for about half an hour they heard someone nearby screaming for help while swimming in the sea, and then went with their group to get the boy out of the water.
Hammel said, "At first we thought they were shouting at the pleasure of holding lobsters, but then I realized they were shouting, 'Kill me!'"
I've been bitten!'
When I came to him, he was gone, and he was gone."
"I said, 'Come out of the water!' and Hammel said, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where doctors said his condition was critical.
It is not known which group of people was attacked.
Life Guard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was found to be harmless and not belonging to the species.
The boy survived with severe injuries to the upper part of the torso, Gilles said.
Panto Beach in Casabold was closed for 48 hours without the Swami entering the NCNitas for interrogation and security purposes.
There are about 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are harmless, Giles said.
The company has decided to enter the UK market
Sainsbury's wants to set up a department store-like beauty salons in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with special assistants.
Fashion and homeware sales in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market are on the decline, which is why there are 11 stores across the country that will set up massive beauty salons and, if successful, more stores next year.
Supermarkets want to invest in a space that was once home to TVs, microwaves and homewares.
Sainsbury’s reported that it is doubling its beauty services with brands such as Revlon, SC, TweezerMan and Dr.Papa for the first time with nearly 3000 products.
In addition to existing brands such as Boots, existing brands such as Loreal, Maybeeline, and Burt's Bees also have more space.
The supermarket also wants to resume its boutique make-up services so that more young people can offer them as much of the vegan products as they want.
Similarly, Fragrance's store, a retailer that sells perfumes, wants to offer discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening this year in Celle Oak, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and low-dose food purchases at convenience stores on a daily basis, supermarkets need to make a lot of efforts to keep customers going.
"Outlets, like department stores, will grow as part of efforts to chain supermarkets to counter those who sell them at discounted prices such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products,"" said Mike Kopp, chief executive of Sainsbury's."
Sainsbury's is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as introducing many hobbitts, because the two chains were purchased two years ago, which helped Grossery strengthen sales and make purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt to revive its beauty and pharmacy segments by the supermarket has failed.
Sainsbury's and Boots started a joint venture in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended due to problems with the distribution of revenues from the chemists in its supermarkets.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's embarked on a new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Liad's Pharmacy chain owner, Celicio, for a price of <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
Liads will also participate in the plan by offering four stores, including La Roch-Posse and Vichy, as well as expensive skin care brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty salons to provide a new environment for our customers.
We are specially trained and invested in colleagues, who provide advice.
By setting up our brands that cater to all needs and are available in beautiful and comfortable locations, we are challenging the old shopping method and now offering the newest beauty services."
Peter Jones is 'extreme' after Holly Willoughby's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Willaby, a TV presenter to focus on his new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV, has pulled herself out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with the life style brand business of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, making Peter 'angry'.
They don't have time for their own brand of homeware and accessories.
There is a similarity between the couple's business and Gineth Paltrow's goup brand.
The 37-year-old announced his departure on Instagram.
In order to focus on his new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV, Willaby left his life-style brand business of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones.
According to reliable sources, he was "angry" when Willaby, a Golden Girl on TV, told a key meeting Tuesday at the Marlowe Jones business empire's headquarters in Buckinghamshire that he could not devote time to his homeware and accessories brand, True, due to his new deals worth almost <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business is similar to Gineth Paltro's Goop brand and is expected to be twice as big as Willaby's Fortune for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willaby, 37, announced his departure on Instagram, while Jones traveled to Britain, one of his favorite vacation spots.
According to sources, "Truth is the most important thing in life.
This will have a long-term impact over the next two decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear about her death.
No one could believe the size of what happened on Tuesday, because it was going to be released very soon.
The entire warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters has items ready for sale."
According to experts, due to the exit of This Morning Presenter, the most popular star in Britain, a company that has invested heavily in all products from cushions, candles to clothing and homeware could suffer losses in the millions and the release could also be further delayed.
It can also be a long distance friendship.
Willaby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Don Baldwin, and his wife, Tara Cap, have been friends for ten years.
Willaby formed Truely in 2016 with Cap, and then Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willaby will now be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant Mac Partlin, who is hosting I'm the Celebrity on ITV.
"We don't comment on his business dealings," Jones said last night.
We've been talking about "falling in love"
Trump joked about the criticism he might face from news outlets because many consider his very positive remarks about the North Korean president to be "not appropriate" for the president.
Why is President Trump so unconcerned?
The Yankees' defense spoke with trepidation.
"I got nothing."
Trump said Kim was keenly looking forward to the second meeting after the first in Singapore in June and that it was a good step forward for denuclearization in North Korea.
Talks on nuclear weapons have stalled.
Nearly three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, the leading ambassador to North Korea in the UN General Assembly stated that there had not been an "inappropriate response" to North Korea's first disarmament actions since the UN General Assembly said on Saturday that there was no "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament actions.
Instead, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure on them.
Trump didn't speak very highly of him.
He said: "We are very concerned about North Korea.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives were lost.
We have a good relationship now."
"My efforts to establish positive relations with Kim have borne fruit, as a result of which rocket testing has been halted, assistance is being provided for the release of the hostages, and the final marks of American soldiers are about to be returned home," he said.
He has been very supportive of his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to send 10,000 people to war in those small areas acting like ordinary presidents, but now we have 200 people on guard there," Trump said.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.
For example, according to the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, they stated that they did not need the help of foreign charitable organizations.
About 10 percent of the population in Lombok is homeless, yet it has not been declared a national disaster, but international aid is a must.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they make it clear that they don't need their international help," Sambang said.
Seve the Children is preparing a team for their move to Paluku, but it's not yet certain whether the aliens will be able to get there.
Indonesian authorities are assessing the local situation to determine whether international aid should be allowed in Palu, Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said.
There are frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, but no measures have been taken to cope with the natural disaster.
Aselo built tsunami rehabilitation centers, but similar ones are not found in other coastal areas.
Even at the time when warnings were issued there was no tsunami warning siren in Palu due to which also there was loss of life.
Traveling to many of the islands in Indonesia is a big challenge even when everything is going well.
Due to natural disasters, transportation becomes more difficult.
The ship, which was set up in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is now on its way to Palu to treat victims in the new disaster area, but it will take at least three days to reach there.
President Joko Widodo has stated in his many campaigns that he will fix the chaotic infrastructure of Indonesia, spending a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the crisis in Joko's administration caused a shortage of funds, and he faces re-election the following year.
Joko is facing a lot of pressure due to religious hatred based on the superstitions of the majority of Muslims in Indonesia.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless as Christians and Muslims resorted to street fighting in heavy swords, arrows, and other deadly weapons.
See this: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge pulled out of a draw with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
When Sturridge's team trailed 1-0, he was given a pass from Jerdon Shaqiri, 30 yards from the Chelsea goal.
He once tapped the ball to the left before kicking the ball into the distant post.
This is the result of a child's effort to go to the top right corner of the net.
The boy finally got out of the car and ran across the street.
“It’s important to get into that position, and then players like Shock forward the ball as much as possible, so I tried to keep it as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw what was coming, but I didn't think too much about it, I just tapped it and then I shot straight."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at halftime due to a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Halfway through the play, the blues-striker returned to Mateo Kovacic before being snipped off the field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly tried to give-and-go while on the half-field.
After that he hit a beautiful through ball so that Hazard could score.
The ball went straight into the net as Hazard hit all obstacles and left-footed Liverpool player Alisson Becker hit the back of the net.
The Champions League group stage match between Liverpool and Napoli will be played on Wednesday at 3 pm at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
The match between Chelsea and Videoton will be played in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said on Sunday morning.
The agency's official spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nurgoho, said at a press conference that many people were trapped under buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and waves rising as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has the remains of buildings that have collapsed.

The residence of the deceased Mahisa would be in the locality, the authorized representative of the police confirmed that her dead body was found in a courtyard.
Some of her friends, who thought she might have been in contact with the woman, came to the scene in the afternoon and asked where the body was found.
The police have informed the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews tried to get into his house, but police were not allowing anyone into or out of the building.
He did not speak about the incident.
Police say it will take a few more hours for everyone to arrive.
Police said the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman who started crying.
Again, this is "extremely sad."

Cramwell's statue in Parliament has been embroiled in a controversy over 'rewriting history'
Poetic justice was to demolish the statue of Cramwell, who with the help of his Puritan followers, had demolished the culture and religious structures of England and behaved like the Taliban.
But Kramwell's Soci<0xC3><0xA9>t<0xC3><0xA9> called the advice "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cramwell Society, said: "Due to ongoing discussions about the removal of the statues, it is inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
Cramwell did not order the removal of statues as part of the English Civil War, nor did he participate in it.
It is likely that Crampwell was mistaken for the mistakes of his predecessor, Thomas, in the century before him.
Sir William Hama Thornecroll's excellent account of Cramwell reveals the 19th century, including his work that we still have to celebrate.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe that Cramwell worked hard to protect Parliament from foreign powers during his dictatorial rule, perhaps even more so in the 19th century.
I don't know if he's fully aware of the ongoing controversy.
The real thing is that our race evolved subsequently due to the conflict that took place in the middle of the 17th century, when Cromwell led a crucial part of that time.
We need to remember and celebrate his accomplishments as the Lord Protector."
A Chinese farmer was killed in an attack on a pig farm
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China and killed him.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that his home name was "Yuan" and that he suffered a serious injury in his artery during the attack, and he was lying in a pool of blood at Sty, located in a market in Liwupanshui Paranthem in the Dwizahu region.
In the Jining of Qinghai region of China, a farmer, a pig breeder, was preparing to inoculate pigs in the hospice on 30 May 2005.
According to news reports, he had come to the market from the nearby Yunnan area along with his cousin to sell his 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found his dead body and a stymied door open next to it.
He said that he noticed that one big male pig snout in the sty had blood stains.
According to a report by forensic experts, the farmer was killed after being attacked by a boar weighing 550 pounds.
According to Giang Evening News, "My cousin's legs were broken and full of blood," he said, calling the farmer Giang "yes."
Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday based on security camera footage.
About an hour later, his body was found.
It's not just the farmer or the farmer.
"When the police reached the spot, we detained the pig without attacking others,"" a market manager told Evening News."
Yuan's family and market officials are discussing compensation for Yuan's death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but there have been some incidents in the past as well.
In 2016, a husband and wife were attacked by a pig near their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a boar weighing 650 pounds was attacked by a Welsh farmer at his tractor, the last of which came to his wife and chased it away.
A manetoba farmer told CBC News in 2012 that after the union where an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, the pigs were not dangerous, but would "lose" if they tasted the blood.
"They are smooth.
They are cozy, enthusiastic... they will not hurt you.
You have to respect them enough."
The remaining parts of Hurricane Rosa cause widespread heavy rains in the southwestern U.S.
According to estimates, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels towards cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Hurricane Rosa may cause flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
According to information at 5 a.m., winds of 85 mph were blowing in Rosalo, a Category 1 hurricane. On Saturday, it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Uuginea, Mexico.
Rose is expected to arrive on Sunday.
During this time, a trough forms in the Pacific Ocean that can travel west to east across the U.S. By the time Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm forms in the northern part of the southwestern U.S., causing a tropical depression.
There will be 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday due to the Rosa.
After that, along with the dry monsoon, there will be widespread rainfall in the southwestern region in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause severe flooding, debris can flow, and landslides can break out in the desert.
In some areas, particularly in the southern Nevada and Arizona region, extreme cyclonic humidity may result in 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour.
One estimate is that anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rain may fall in the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Tropical rain is likely to be widespread and there is a risk of sudden flooding due to rapidly changing weather conditions.
It is dangerous to go to the desert on foot because there is a risk of tropical rain.
Rivers in the valley areas can become violent due to heavy rains and local intense winds can be generated due to thunderstorms and can fly up the garbage.
Heavy rain is possible along the southern coast of California.
In total, half an inch of rain can cause debris to flow and roads to become smooth and slippery.
This is the first rainy season in the region.
Heavy rain is likely to fall in Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning before the start of heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected on all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
The climate in the U.S. may change somewhat significantly in October as the Arctic region cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this can lead to dramatic changes in the environment within a short distance.
The dramatic climate change that occurred in the U.S. between Monday and Friday is a good example.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa are nearly 20 degrees apart in climate.
Over the next few days, the weather will continue to expand.
Temperatures begin in early October in most of the central and eastern U.S., extending south-northeastwards with a range of 80 degrees.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees higher than normal.
Estimated based on conditions that have been present for many years, temperatures in the eastern U.S. may be above average through the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial has been viewed by more than 20 million people
The testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman named Christie Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, was viewed by more than 20 million people via six TV channels on Thursday.
At the same time, the news agencies also broadcast in the middle of the regular program with the intention that anything strange might happen at the last minute on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted an agreement asking the FBI to investigate the allegations within a week.
Fold told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he remembered 100 percent that Cao Cao had tried to force himself into a drunken frenzy at a high school party and untied his clothes.
In his statement, he said that he was 100 per cent sure that no such incident had taken place.
It was viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The average viewership is calculated by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers for other networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, are not immediately available.
Nielsen usually had trouble calculating the number of people viewing from the offices.
To put it with an example, as many people watched the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen said the Fox News channel, which fully defended Cavano's appointment, was viewed by an average of 5.69 million people throughout the day.
The second-placed ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, there were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC, and 2.52 million on CNN.
Even after the trial, the interest continued at the same level.
Flake played a key role in Friday's game.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement that we will vote in favor of caucus, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday captured footage of Flake expressing outrage at protesters who confronted him while he was on his way to an elevator for the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He was criticized by many, and it was broadcast live on CNN, so he stood motionless for several minutes.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"You have the power, but many women are helpless."""
"My office has released a statement, but I will say more at the committee hearing," Flake said.
Cable and broadcast networks broadcast hours later during the voting by the Judiciary Committee on sending the nomination to the full Senate for voting.
"I'll only agree to it after the FBI agrees to investigate the allegations next week, as the minority Democrats demand," he said.
The word was coined by Democratic Senator Chris Couns.
Flake made the decision after talking to several other senators, including Coons.
There is a power in Fleck's decision, which is a sign that the Republicans will not accept the nomination without a trial.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations.
Britain's Prime Minister, May, has said that those who criticize Brexit are doing "politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May told the Sunday Times that those who criticize her decision to leave the European Union are "politicizing" Britain's future, ignoring the country's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conservative Party conference.
In another interview to the newspaper, which published his picture on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson only blamed Theresa May's actions, saying it would be "extremely damaging" for Britain and the EU to want to impose reciprocal taxes.
Dytian Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the case leading to the death of 20-year-old basketball player Wide Sims at LSU.
Police said 20-year-old Ditian Simpson was arrested, taken to jail, and booked in a second-degree murder case in the Boton Rog.
Authorities have released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, in which Ciss' glasses fell off, police said.
The police collected spectacles from the scene, which contained Simpson's DNA, according to a CBS affiliate WAFB.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to having shot himself.
His bond was set at $350,000.
The official of the Eastern Boton Rog Parish Karanner released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that Wideey died due to a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The arrest was made on the basis of an investigation by the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Torque Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and local citizens.
LSU athletes director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for "investigating and doing justice."
Sims is 20 years old.
His height was 6.6 feet, he grew up in Boton Rogue, and his father also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU team coach Whale Wide said the entire team was "aggrieved" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's never going to be the beach," he said.
Fire breaks out in Mexico City due to a mountain
The ash from the Popocat<0xC3><0xA9>petl fire reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital city.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (NDMA) has issued a warning to all residents to stay away from the volcano as it has erupted 183 times in the last 24 hours.
The Centre is monitoring a number of tremors and tremors.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash forming on the mirrors of cars in the surrounding areas of Mexico's capital, such as Joachimilco.
Geologists say the impact increased to 45 miles (72 km) from the volcano after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the central Mexico region in September 2017.
Mount Don Goo has been active since 1944.
Clashes broke out between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona during Saturday's clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot control police, and opponents also gathered in thousands to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's consolidation of a vote on separatism.
The streets were filled with smoke as separatists came in crowds and threw eggs and powdered paint on the rioting police, though usually more tourists.
The police resorted to baton charge to control the clashes.
For several hours, independence seekers chanted "don't forget, don't forgive," while Unionist protesters chanted "Spain Zindabad."
According to local media reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests.
A year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, there was tension in areas seeking independence, though separatist Catalans continued to celebrate it.
Like many who voted, many wanted independence, but many people were barred from voting because of the low turnout.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured when police tried to block voting in the violence-torn areas ahead of last year's vote.
Pro-independence groups campaigned to avoid Friday night demonstrations in support of national policy.
The show has moved on, but has moved on.
"We have lost all hope of independence for Catalonia," said Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician involved in the separatist protest.
Last year was the happiest year of my life.
"My parents were happy to see me, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a minor victory in last year's regional elections, Catalan independence-seeking parties somehow managed to keep their leading leaders in hiding or in police custody, holding a referendum, and trying to declare independence.
According to a 42-year-old mechanic named Joan Peug, who was recording the protest in support of the police, the dispute was caused by politicians on both sides.
He said: "It's growing every day.
One of the Catalan leaders, who has been in pre-arrest since last year, announced on Saturday that he and I will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The only way forward is to contest the European elections to appease the anti-democratic and oppressive tendencies of the Spanish government," he said.
London: A man was arrested for driving a car into a house in Derry
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly driving into a house in London Derry.
The incident took place at Balanagar Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage to the building was extensive.
At the same time, a crossbow can also be used on the car.

The Rangers were surprised to see Promoted Livingston, their second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club, to Steven Gerrard.
A major change was made due to the strike made by Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga, with Gerry increasing the level of the Halt Side, and Hibernian in second place.
Gerard Side is one win away from winning the Premiership this season, and they will face the Leader's Hearts next Sunday.
In the meantime, I'm going to have a quick run on Tuesday.
During this time, Livingstone increased his illustrious tour to six wins, having not lost since Holt Stilt, who replaced Kenny Miller as head coach last month.
The White Sox have lost a leg with the Browns.
The Holt team had to be in the lead a long time before they could score, causing the Rangers to suffer in all sorts of ways because of their straight counter-attack.
Scott Robinson tried hard to score a break-through goal, and then faced Greg Hal Ketts as Alan Lithgow tried to score a straight goal.
The Rangers faced the hosts well when they were playing with the hosts, they troubled the visitors in all sorts of ways.
In this way they have achieved an important goal.
The Rangers made a free-kick, Livingston focused on the opening, with Declan Gallagher, with Robinson, paving the way for Menga, who scored in the middle of the net with a touchdown.
At that stage, the Rangers were dodged, but because of the home defense being strong, they couldn't bother goalkeeper Liam Kelly,
Although Alfredo saved a force from Kelly, the same pattern continued in the second half.
Scott Pittman failed due to Alan McGregor, the Rangers goalkeeper, as Lithgow flicked away from the set play.
Crosses coming into the Living Stone Box in a row have been cleared, while two penalty claims have been rendered infructuous, one due to the handball when the Substitute Glen Middleton made the Halket Challenge and the other due to the handball.
"Financial" from "Living Stone"
The BBC Statland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The Financial Performance and Result of Living Stone.
"They're playing well and they're improving the game.
Their attitude and behaviour have completely changed since they came to the top, but these compliments go to Holt, who has completely changed the team once he takes over.
He created a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket had a brilliant, well-ordered defense, while only Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joey Vooral busy.
The Raiders have lost their way as well.
They used to play the best when Gerard was around, now they've lost their standards.
Their final performance wasn't perfect <0xE2><0x80><0x93> only once did they manage to make a good home side open, so this was a warning to the Rangers, who have recently been staying in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany ends today <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the visit is being held to improve relations with NATO allies.
A number of issues have emerged, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan is going to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
It is the most populated city outside Turkey.
The police had banned the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but only his supporters turned up in large numbers to see the president.
A number of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdish people, raised slogans against Erdogan's policies and the German government that invited him into the country.
During the visit, some Turkish people in Germany criticized him as a hero and his opponents as dictator.
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in Deptford
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
Around 10:15 BST, the incident took place at the intersection of Evelyn Street and Bestwood Street, a busy road in Dept.
The driver of the car rammed into the car and the doctors started treatment, but he died on the spot.
This happened a few months ago, on a Saturday, after the death of a cyclist in a hit-and-run case on Children's Street, about a mile from the site.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives about the matter.
Some roads in the area have been closed, buses diverted, and motorists are advised not to travel to the area.
Long Larty Jail: Six officers injured in clashes
Six prison officials were injured in the clashes that took place in a high-security prison, a prison official said.
Clashes began and continue at HMP Long in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday.
We have deployed special "tornado" officers in the field to control the scuffles, out of which eight are in one wing.
Minor injuries to the head were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "At present, we have specially trained prison staff to deal with HMP Long Lartin.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible must be handed over to the police and their training extended."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, some of whom are some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that he was treated in the hospital after a prisoner attacked the prison supervisor.
In October last year, special officers were deployed to bring the situation under control due to the attack on officers with pool balls.
There is a risk of flooding in the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake due to Hurricane Rosa (which may benefit drought areas)
It's likely to happen early next week because of the rare tropical climate formed in Arizona and the risk of flooding along the southwestern desert due to the residual energy in Hurricane Rosa.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flooding in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City as well as parts of southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday.
It's possible that the rain will continue through Monday through Tuesday.
According to a tweet by the National Weather Service in Phoenix, "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have become tropical cyclones or depressions!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border.
According to the National Hurricane Center's latest estimates, 2 to 4 inches of rain may fall, with up to 6 inches of rain in the Mongolian Rim in Arizona under some special circumstances.
The Central Rockies and the Great Basin along with other parts of the southwestern desert may receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain in some special areas.
Areas that are not at risk of flooding have been suffering from drought for a long time, and the rose is a blessing for them.
Flooding is a big problem, but the recent drought in the southwest can benefit from this rain.
According to a U.S. drought monitoring agency estimate, more than 40 percent of Arizona has at least one of the most severe droughts, the two largest categories,” weather.com reported.
First, landslides broke out on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico due to Hurricane Rosa.
On Sunday morning, when Rosa was still at hurricane level, winds of 85 miles per hour were blowing 385 miles per hour over Punta Uginia, Mexico, which was moving 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is slowly weakening as it enters the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean.
So it could lead to landslides at the level of tropical storms in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains can cause flooding in many parts of Mexico.
“There may be 3 inches of rain falling from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, which is likely to reach a maximum of 10 inches,” weather.com reported.
Rosa then travels north to Mexico at the height of a tropical storm, turning into a tropical depression as it reaches the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and then into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"There is a possibility of heavy rainfall, mainly in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern desert regions due to Rosa or the rest of it," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can lead to life-threatening floods, debris flows in deserts, and landslides in hilly areas.
Mid-Season Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested in connection with the stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
Around 4:00 BST on Saturday, a young man was lying with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somer Norton.
He was rushed to the hospital and his condition was "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who has any mobile phone footage of the incident to be provided to them.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered because of the "cruelty and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"To vote for a new president is to reject the cruel and anarchic actions of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump said that throughout his nomination process, Kavanaugh suffered because of the brutality and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Decades ago, when I, Cavano, was young, Cavano appeared before Congress on Thursday because of allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had forced and mentally disturbed me and sexually assaulted me.
Ford was also present at the hearing regarding his allegations.
"The American people have seen the wisdom, the quality, and the courage that Cavano showed that day," he said.
"To vote in support of Justice Kavanaugh means to vote in support of the most effective legal professionals in contemporary times, the person who has served the nation so much," he said.
The president also referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, who explained the importance of winning Republicans in the midterm elections.
"In just five weeks, we're going to have one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't want to run, but I have to run," he said.
That's why I go to all the places and support the amazing candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were "blocking and creating obstructions."
One of the GOP leadership told CNN that the first key policy voting for Cavano's nomination could take place before Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is still growing.
At least 384 people were killed and many more were missing when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people came to the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate the festival on Friday, while many lost their lives and everything in the vicinity was destroyed by a six-metre-high wave.
The quake was of a magnitude of 7.5.
"Even after yesterday's tsunami warnings, people became victims because they were so busy with their work that they did not immediately leave the coast," Sutopo Purwo Nurgoho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, said at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Normally the tsunami wasn't just coming, it took off cars, logs and houses on the ground," Nurgoho said, adding that the tsunami traveled along the ocean at speeds of 800 kmph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He said some people were able to climb trees to escape the tsunami and save their lives.
Around 16,700 people have been shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
According to photos released by the disaster agency, many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and fallen, and water reached around the mosque.
Flooding continued in the city on Saturday.
2.4 million people were displaced by the earthquake.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Institute of Technology Assessment and Utilization (BPPT), the energy released during the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
They said the city is on the edge of a long, thin bay, which could also have caused an increase in severity.
Noorgoho said the damage was "extremely serious," with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsing.
Under the collapsed buildings were the corpses of some of the victims, with 540 injured and 29 missing, he said.
He said the loss of life and damage could be heavy in Dongla, the region closest to the epicenter, and along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Paluku.
"Information from Dongla has come to a complete standstill," Nurgoo said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people live there" and that "our employees and volunteers are going to help in the affected areas."
"It's already a tragic event, but it can become even more painful."
Although officials say the waves hit the coast at the time of the warning, many criticized the agency on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami in the city of Palu.
A video shared on social media showed a man standing on a building, warning people on the street under the threat of a tsunami, "Run away."
Within a few minutes, a huge wall-like wave swept the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The power supply was completely cut off due to the earthquake and tsunami, causing traffic jams in and around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to provide assistance.
The army has been sending planes carrying cargo from Jakarta and other cities, but the homeless still need a lot of food and other minimum facilities, officials said.
The airport in the city is open only for rescue operations, which will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will inspect the evacuation of people in Palu.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
Its very saddening.
"The employees of World Vision in Dongla went to Palu City, where they stayed in tents set up in their office's court yard, to work and to film the horrific scenes,"" Doceba said."
"They told me that a lot of houses were destroyed when we saw them," he said.
Its very saddening.
Rescue teams quickly began their rescue efforts, but some complained that foreign volunteers, who were experts, were not being allowed to come to the city of Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funds and supplies can only be received when a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
The notification has not been issued yet.
"This is still a disaster confined to one region," said Aaliyah Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Well, if the government declares this to be a national disaster," he said, "we can allow international aid, but for the time being it is not allowed."
This is the second day after the earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Friday, and even though family and friends are missing, their relatives are still hopeful that they will be safe somewhere and able to return safely from natural disasters.
On Monday, a man was pulled from the water.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued a woman trapped between the rubble for two days, next to her mother's body.
Two paragliders trained from Gendun Subandano, who coached the Indonesian national paragliding team, have gone missing, who were trained for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of the people who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel were my students, Mandagi said.
He said: "I have a lot of confidence in the senior side.
Within hours of the Paragliding community being informed of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, Gendun explained how he had communicated the information to the pool players participating in the beach festival in the form of WhatsApp messages.
But the message was clear, and there were no blue ticks.
He said, "I don't have a message."
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling in cash at an ATM in Newport, Livy
On Friday morning, Newport Police released a press release saying thieves stole $26,750 while Brink's employees were filling in cash at an ATM in Newport, Livy.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver of the car had emptied an ATM at an entertainment complex and was trying to fill it with more money.
While he was doing his work, a man came running from the back of a Brick employee and snatched a bag containing money to fill in the ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses said there were several suspects at the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about them should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680 immediately.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name to "Yay"
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to "Yay."
In a tweet on Saturday, he said: "Everybody knows Kanye West is in power."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed "Yes" by everyone for some time, and he used the name "Manicker" for his eighth album, which was released in June.
He's about to release his new album Yandhi on Saturday Night Live, and more than ever before this change has come to the fore.
The show's designer said he was going to replace Ariana Grande, who left the show "for reasons of passion."
Not only is it a nickname for his current professional name, but it is also of great significance according to his religious beliefs.
"I believe the word 'ye' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible 'ye' means you," West said earlier this year while discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"You, me, and all of us."
"Kanye" means "one and only," and from there to "just you," it is a symbol of all the good, bad, and confusion in us.
The album is about who we are."
He is one of the most famous names to have been changed.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, and he announced this year that he likes the names "Love" and "Brother Love."
JAY-Z, who had previously teamed up with West, changed his name to Hyphen or Capitals.
The Mexican government has said it will not use force against civilians
President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador of Mexico has announced that he will no longer use force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the students' bloodshed is approaching.
"I will never use the military for the oppression of civilians," L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said on Saturday.
On October 2, 1968, 300 people were killed when the military opened fire on a peaceful protest by left-wing students across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised that he would strive for the advancement of young Mexicans by offering monthly concessions to educated youth and establishing more free public universities.
He said that the youth are committing crimes due to unemployment and illiteracy.
Doubling U.S. spending for A.I.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple, said China has become more active in artificial intelligence, and the U.S. needs to spend more on it.
He said that although the U.S. as a whole does not have an official AI plan, several departments in the U.S. government have made statements about AI.
At the same time, China released its plan last year: aim to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doing double the investment in AI is a good start as all other countries are far behind the U.S., so that we can find even better things in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funds would double the chances of the U.S. achieving new successes in AI.
Lee has authored a book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," which is published by Hoton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B><0x2B>.
In 1980, Carnegie Mellon became the highest-ranking American Othello player when he worked on the AI system at the University, then as an executive at Microsoft Research and president at the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee previously mentioned the U.S. government's technology for the Defense Advanced Research Project's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next project was coming up to help identify future plans.
Lee said that researchers in the U.S. usually have to work very hard to get government funding.
He said: "It's not the universities, it's the universities."
Other technology companies, such as Facebook and Google, have hired AI experts from universities in recent years.
Lee also said that it would be good to change the immigration policy as part of the U.S. AI efforts.
"It is also a good idea to immediately issue green cards to those who have done PhDs in AI," he said.
The State Council of China released its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Li said that just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are funding U.S. researchers, the National Natural Science Foundation in China is also funding those in educational institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor.
The U.S. Department of Defense earlier this year established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center to recruit people from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced that it is investing $2 billion in AI Next.
For NSF, currently AI research is spending more than $100 million a year.
At the same time, the U.S. law to establish a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence was not enforced for months.
The Macedonians voted in the second referendum to change the country's name.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday in the referendum whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" because of the decades-long conflict with Greece over the country's current name and its inability to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
There was a region called Macedonia in Greece, but they argued that the country in the north was trying to invade the region, using its veto power to prevent them from joining the European Union and NATO.
An agreement was reached between the two governments based on the newly proposed name, but the change is opposed by the Nationalist Appointees, who fear that the majority of the Slavic people in Macedonia will lose their ethnic identity.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and there was also a campaign to ban it, so there was doubt as to whether at least 50 percent would vote, if necessary.
The question in the Referendum Ballot is: "Will you accept the agreement with the Government of Greece for membership of NATO and the EU."
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that Macedonia, one of the emerging countries after the break-up of Yugoslavia, must become a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of this country, under the protection of the European Union and the young people here who want to live freely," said 79-year-old Olivera George Eveska of Skopje.
Many MPs said they would respect the outcome of the vote even if there was no provision in the law.
A name change requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said that there was no disturbance till 1.00 pm.
In the 2016 parliamentary elections, 34 per cent of the electorate voted, 66 per cent of the registered voters, with the police currently voting only 16 per cent.
"I have come to vote for the future of my children, for a place for this country in Europe," 62-year-old Jockey Tavens said.
Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, his wife Zorika and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in support of the name change, which would give Macedonia a seat in NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is laying chairs in small tents set up by opponents of the Referendum in front of the parliament in Skobze.
"We have to join NATO and the EU, but let's go with self-respect, not through sloppiness," he said.
"We are a poor country, but we have self-respect.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can join them, along with countries like China and Russia, in the European-Asian Union."
The Prime Minister said that if Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, becomes a member of NATO, there would be a huge investment.
"Most people support it, more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," he said after the vote.
He said: "It's our future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Center for Policy Research in Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of respondents are in favor of the referendum, which is less than the minimum requirement.
In another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
To be successful, a candidate must win at least 50% of the vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major setback for the pro-Western government, which formed in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has been struggling to keep his goal alive
Manchester United's Sergio Aguero and Raheem won 2-0 against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
In the 65th minute, Aguero scored easily.
At the start of the series, the Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield.
He was accompanied by two Brighton defenders before he hit into the open field.
The four of them turned to the greenery.
He went through a defender before striking out at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to the left and headed for the door.
While the English forward delivered the ball with his first touch to Aguero, he crossed Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with the right boot and hit the ball into the right half of the net.
"Aguaro is suffering from foot problems," Pep Guardiola, the city's manager, told reporters.
"We talked to him for 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what had happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
Sterling gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League's Skullfull.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
The ball was given to Aguero, who was completely in the area on the Brighton side.
He played brilliantly from Leroy Sen's left side.
He gave the sterling to the far post after a few touchdowns.
Sky blues forward hit the ball into the net and slides out of the boundary.
The match between City and Hoffenheim will be played at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinchem, Germany, at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday.
Shapiro wants to play in a game with the Redskins
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, so it doesn't matter how well they play.
Shurzer, who has always been keen to play brilliantly against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but whether this will have an impact on the Rockies' chances of a playoff, is already in the lead in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"The people here in Denver are very excited, even if we don't have a use for it because of this match, as well as our opponent is more aggressive than all the teams I've played in the whole year, so this match is going to be exciting.
Why can't I compete?"
Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but it seems that in such a case the Shurcher may be allowed to pitch.
Scherzer, who is set to begin his 34th term, will participate in a bullpen session on Thursday, usually on a restful Sunday.
Washington Raid Handler is continuing the season with 300 strikeouts in 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Trump was referring to the controversy surrounding his Supreme Court pick, Kavanaugh, who said the Republican victory in the midterm elections was important.
"Everything we did in November was in danger.
In a few weeks, we are going to have one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the biggest ones -- I don't want to run, but I'm running all over the place to support amazing candidates."
"This is happening because of these horrible extremists from the Democrats.
They're trying to get back into power anyway, they're ready to get down to any level.
For power they can hurt anyone, do anything, but we must not allow power to fall into their hands."
"Democrats are on a mission to disrupt and disrupt."
"Look at the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "copists, liars, hypocrites and people who can't be trusted."
The audience roared when he mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is ranked by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you get the paper?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your body language is not good - it's the worst body language I've ever known."
The church is no longer a church.
This is an insult to those who are free to express their opinions.
I was surprised to see the local people in my group.
I have also joined the list of Labour MPs who have been troubled by free speech.
The same thing happened to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, for opposing hatred of Jews.
I have been very critical of Jeremy Corbyn.
"I was opposed to responsible policies such as European economic policy and national security, but in the past Jeremy was also opposed to his predecessors.
On Friday, a notice was sent to the meeting of the Nagingham East Labour Conference, which said, "We need to bring everyone together at the meetings and achieve good results."
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, most of the meetings were held on a Friday night.
The saddest thing is that right now, meetings and politics are no longer held "with love and respect," which have long since disappeared.
There is no place for dissent in the Labour Party, every opinion must be consistent with the party leadership.
The practice began just days after Jeremy was elected leader, and we regret that all like-minded party members, including myself, have to take a U-turn on every issue and compromise whether or not we care about national security or the EU single market.
If I say anything in public, irrespective of what I say, there will be vicious attacks on me on social media and I will not be in the Labour Party at all.
It doesn't just happen to me.
Some of my friends are more interested in politics than I am in politics.
Every day, I am amazed at the courage and commitment of my colleagues who are bravely pushing forward despite facing harassment, even with sexual or racial discrimination.
It is a very common language in today's politics.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should be more tolerant of everyone.
But, of course, it's not so much a broad church now that every "no-confidence" resolution or a change of chosen rules is becoming more and more narrow.
For the past two years, I have been told by many people that I should go head-to-head and not speak in public, but that "all is well."
But thats not how politics works.
32 years ago I joined the Labour Party because of the careless attitude of the Thatcher government, which caused almost the entire collapse of my school class building, and I decided to provide the best possible service to everyone, be it a local councillor or a minister of the government.
I have never voted in any election, not even in the last election.
"Everyone in Nottingham East is clear about my policy views and my disagreements with the current leadership.
"I want to tell those who introduced the motion on Friday that they don't need to waste time and energy defending my loyalty to the Labour Party at a time when all the families, businesses, or our government services in the country are suffering because of Brexit.
Whether members of the Labour Party or not, I say to all the members of my constituency in Nottingham Momentum: It is my good fortune to serve you and I will strive for the good of all of you, and I will never compromise on account of these retrenchment threats or political interests.
Chris Leslie, Nottingham East MP
Ayer 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayer is now at the top of the standings
The final result may have changed somewhat due to two last-minute efforts, but Ayer, who showed excellent play in the Tenant Premiership today, has qualified to be at the top.
Now that they are at the top of the table with them, this team is the only one that hasn't lost yet.
In the end, this success was possible because they made better use of their opportunities along with their excellent defense, a feat which must be attributed to coach Peter Murchi.
"We've had a lot of challenges so far, but we haven't lost at all, so I'm very happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayer, they made better use of the opportunities than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt, converted by Frazier Klimo, came to the fore in the 14th minute, but Slotland caped Roar Hughes to the Yellow Card and the Warriors released the game, resulting in Melrose not using the opportunity and Jason Baggett's attempt was a failure.
Ayer took the lead with a penalty scored by Klimo at exactly half-time, after which his score at break time went up to 17-5.
The second half started well for Melrose, with the effort of Patrick Anderson and a batted conversion reducing the opening to five points.
The game was halted for a long time due to an injury to Rowrid Knott, who was taken on a stretcher, and after re-starting the game, Stafford McDowell's effort was converted by Klimo.
McPherson, the acting captain of Ayer, received a yellow card, and Melrose took full advantage of his extra in Bruce Calvin's failure in the highly-stressed game.
However, the home side rebounded, and Stan Hutchinson received a yellow card for chasing Klimo, even without the ball, backing McPherson ahead of Ayer on penalty line-out.
After David Armstrong's box-kick was caught by Kyle Rowe and Gregor sent Henry away from the fifth attempt on the home side, Klimo miraculously converted just as he did when the match resumed.
The game's developer is working on a new game
Still Game Starr has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company, and he is entering the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old appeared on the popular BBC show as Jack Jarvis, the writer of which he co-starred with comedy star Greed Hemphill.
The duo announced that the show would end with the upcoming ninth season, possibly because Kierner hoped to start a new life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Morn Limited.
Although the Scottish Sun source announced that Kierner was entering the Glass Go's "excellent restaurant business," he did not respond to the story.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which has land on all fours, hopes to re-open its way to the Pacific through a court of law
The sailors arrived at the Rigging Claude Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags were hoisted in government buildings.
The slogan echoed in naval stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "It's our right to go to the sea.
It's our responsibility to get it back."
Bolivia had to cede its coastline to Chile because of a resource dispute in the 19th century, and they were eager to return to the Pacific Ocean.
They have been on the same page for decades, but the International Court of Justice will deliver its verdict on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is on a good run, there's unity, there's calm, and we think there's a good outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the ICJ's verdict on the big screen, turning the Hague in their favour because of Bolivia's decades-long struggle, and now Chile is negotiating with them to give them some space at sea.
Locally-popular President Evo Morales is set to run for re-election next year amid controversy, and he is also excited about Monday's decision.
"We're going back to the Pacific Ocean very soon," he said.
However, many analysts believe that the court's ruling may not be in favour of Bolivia and that the ruling will only bring about a slight change.
The UN in the Netherlands does not have the authority to allocate Chile's territory, and it is not possible to say what the outcome of the negotiations will be.
The ICJ's decision comes just six months after the first arguments, and the case is not so "complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Whatever Bolivia's desire, it may have been a set back in the last four years.
"The current government has hijacked Bolivia's desire to have a sea route," Zarate said.
She also said that some of the positive feedback about Chile has been hampered by Molaris' excellent rhetoric.
At one time there were negotiations between Bolivia and Chile, but it was difficult to resume negotiations after these developments.
The two countries have not sent diplomats to each other since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduarda Rodriguez Veltez, who is Bolivia's representative at the Hoge, rejected the idea that the court was working at a fast pace.
On Monday, he said Bolivia "will have an excellent opportunity to usher in a new era in their relations with Chile" by "removing difficulties that have been in mutual interest for 139 years."
Calzadilla dismissed the argument that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the issue for his own political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This is an opportunity to forget the past."
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons until it has full confidence in the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said in an address to the nation that "we will not give up our nuclear weapons until we have full confidence in Washington."
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
He urged the US to fulfill its promises made during the talks between the leaders of the virus countries in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for the resumption of non-proliferation and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, three months after talks with the North Korean leader in Singur.
Continuing the sanctions, Rei said it was a "mistake" to assume that North Korea would come down as long as the U.S. did not declare the Korean War over.
Washington has said it will not allow Pyongyang to use its nuclear weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are seeking a second term.
There is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang is really ready to give up its weapons, the only available way to defend its country.
Pompeo will visit Pyongyang next month to set up a second round of talks between Kim and President Trump.
For the High Street near you, you are going to have amazing hats at the upcoming fashion show in Paris
If you want new hats or want to get out of the sun completely.
Designers Valentin and Thom Brown will display their SS19 collection hats at Paris Fashion Week.
These hats, which are generally not possible to wear, have been doing well on Instagram this summer, and the designers have impressed by wearing their hats with models on the catwalk.
The Valentino cap, made in such a way that the head of the models and the law seemed to wrap the feathers, caught everyone's attention.
Other large accessories include bejeweled water mills, wizard hat, pineapple, etc. but these aren't made for keeping your head warm.
Tom Brown performed some of the strangest masks for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks have lip-stitched dolls, which look more like a harmless lectern rather than a hoot culture.
One is a scuba diving gear with a smoky, goggles, while the other is like a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky to see it all.
Style watchers have estimated that a very large number of bonnets may come to the high streets near you.
The big hats were worn by 'La Bomba', a two-foot wide Straw Hat was worn by all from Rihanna to Emily Rajakoowski.
These big hats that can't be worn at all in everyday life have made a splash on social media with a cult label, just as the model wearing the swimsuit that the Straw Beach Batch brought it on the catwalk is so big.
At the Paris Fashion Week, the Jaquemous La Rivera SS19 collection featured a Bunt Orange Raphia bag, a Raffia Fringe, and a white leather handle on top.
Luke Armitage, though a celebrity stylist, told her: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>I want these big hats and beach bags to appear on High Street for the next summer <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the designer is wonderfully crafted, and now we can’t deny the demand for these big accessories.’
John Edwards: Global Citizens Need Language Skills
Independent schools in Scotland are providing excellent education, once again proved by the results of the 2018 examination, in which individual and team skills in sports, arts, music and other social activities are strengthened.
With a population of over 30,000, the schools across Slotland are run by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) to provide the best services to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to provide their students with a higher education, make their lives wonderful, and make them global citizens.
In the field of education, which aims to uncover the talent of the students, the school is choosing modern languages as a popular and desired curriculum.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his brain."
If you speak in his language, it goes to his heart."
So, this is an example that we cannot build relationships with other countries and gain their trust by relying solely on English.
The results of this year's examination showed that students in independent schools were getting the highest score by choosing languages as their main subject.
68% of foreign language learners have achieved a higher grade A.
According to data collected from SCIS Schools, which has 74 members, 72 per cent got a Mandarin Higher Grade A, 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish achieved an A.
This means that Scotland's independent schools are providing children and young people with knowledge of foreign languages that they should use in the future.
In independent schools curricula and elsewhere, languages have now become a subject of choice, similar to the STEM curriculum (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Jobs and Skills, up to 17 percent of the reasons for non-recruitment are language skills.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important for the future.
Language skills are very important in today's world.
Knowing a second language, wherever you are in the world, will be of great help to you.
People with knowledge of their language who can speak directly to those who come from abroad are definitely ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent speak a foreign language at least to the point of conversation, and only 15 percent speak French.
It is very important for children to learn different languages.
Learning multiple languages, especially those from developing countries, can make children more likely to get a better job.
Different languages are taught in different schools.
More classic modern languages are being taught in most schools, while others are being taught, such as Japanese or Mandarin, a requirement for the UK with 2020 in mind.
Regardless of your child's language skills, they will be able to learn the language.
Scotland's independent schools offer all kinds of services to prepare children for the weather and to prepare them for the challenges of the future.
This can be rejected at the moment, but in the world of business, languages are going to be very important for the future of the country, so they must be included in education.
Modern languages must be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools in Scotland offer this choice, diversity, and skill set for young people.
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
The Lakers will play their first game against LeBron in San Diego on Saturday
This is good news for fans of LeBron James, who is set to play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James will be playing in the pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
He still hasn't decided how long he'll stay.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers report Mike Trudell tweeted that James could probably only play for a limited number of minutes.
During a practice session earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for a six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need my preseason games to be ready," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign from Wheeling, Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including spots in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
His confirmation vote for his nominee to the Supreme Court was halted, so he began campaigning for the midterm elections, amid concerns that Republicans would lose the November election.
How many hours a day is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how to watch it online?
According to the schedule, the Trump rally is to be held in Wheeling, Virginia, at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally online in West Virginia via the following YouTube livestream.
The Senate confirmation vote is likely to be delayed by a week until the FBI's investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is complete.
This is especially important for Republicans in the run-up to the November election.
So the main goals of Trump's five rallies in the coming week will be to "encourage volunteers and Republican supporters, to retain and maintain their current dominance in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Trump travels to as many states as possible in this campaign to have a hold on the Congress," said Reuters.
Supporters in Orio and Pennsylvania may come to the rally tonight at the Vesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and it will be covered by Pittsburgh Media, said West Virginia Metro News.
He's on his way to West Virginia, where Trump won by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, the second visit this month.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Maurice, the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It wouldn't be fair for Morissey to have to come directly to the president to give him a boost to his campaign," said Simon Heyder, a political science expert at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA tried their best to keep the chances of going into Sunday's singles alive
After three one-sided sessions, the rider's cup would have been required if the foursomes had taken place on Saturday afternoon.
Like the swinging pendulum of momentum, players feel that the game can change at any moment, and that is certainly the case in such competitions.
So, where do you think they are now?
"They used to be six points ahead, now it's four, which means we're carrying momentum a little bit better," said Jordan Spieth.
However, Europe has an advantage with four points, with twelve remaining.
According to Spieth's words, there was a good positive atmosphere for the Americans and good encouragement from the fans, with Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day, scoring four points each from a three-point situation.
Stacey is a wonderful example.
After he and Thomas scored two points together, they all scored more when they were able to win the match with a total of four all-square.
When he got to 15, everyone shouted the same thing because of his putt, which meant that there was still hope for the American team.
"It's really a tough situation for you," he said.
This is for everyone in the game.
There are 18 marks.
In the last two days of the Ryder Cup, only Frankeso Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Only the prettiest couple in Europe managed to score a four-for-four, and they didn't make any mistakes at all.
Not only did the "Mollywood" couple shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also didn't bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and Friday mornings.
If those runs, the excitement and the energy, look at it, mean they must win on Saturday, no one seems to be able to score more points than Fleetwood or Mollini at The Golf National by evening.
They may be in different places at the same time.
European success has not yet been achieved.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played somewhat better after scoring forceballs played together by Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren.
Due to a bogey and two doubles in the front nine, Spaniard and Swede reached a hole they had never reached before.
There is no one to help you in your home.
It's great to see fourballs and foursomes, because the interaction between the pairings, the exchange of advice, happens all the time.
So far, Europe has been playing with excellent team spirit, leading the way in a fine day, but Team USA have also done well in the foursomes session today, especially on the state side.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
With a 10-6 lead in four-balls and four-sums against the United States on Saturday, Europe's team came up with a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
So far at The Golf National, Tom Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have taken the lead with two wins on four points, overtaking Tiger Woods, who has been in some trouble.
European player Thom Bjorn, who was on a quest to regain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1 with the American side who missed the morning four-balls.
The U.S. played well, winning two matches at Foursomes, but they failed to dominate.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Furyk Side would need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles.
Fleetwood became the first European to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win the first four matches by four points with a stunning "Mollywood" performance.
After defeating Woods, Patrick Reed, they defeated Woods and American Rookie Bryson Denchaby more effectively, 5&4.
Woods lost two matches on Sunday by his own mistakes, and now he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, losing seven of them in a row.
Justine Ross, who did not play in the morning fourballs, along with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, beat the duo of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keepka 2&1, who are ranked one and three in the world.
It's not as easy as it was in the South West of England.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thom set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
After they won 2&1 against John Reham and Ian Poulter of Spain, they won 4&3 against Poulter and Romy McLary, but lost the first two holes.
This is only the second time in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team in a four-point deficit has made it to the singles, while Farik is trying to retain the trophy.
After being the second-best team for two days, they played brilliantly in the counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it's "impossible" to unilaterally withdraw weapons without forming a full-fledged trust
Speaking at the United Nations on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the continuation of sanctions against the United States had created more distrust in the United States and that it would not be possible for the country to unilaterally withdraw its nuclear weapons.
Speaking at the annual general assembly, Ri Yong said the North had taken "significant positive steps" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, destabilising its nuclear weapons center, and guaranteeing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their technology.
"There was no action from the U.S. side."
“We cannot have full faith in our national security without full trust in the U.S. Under circumstances like this it would not be possible for us to withdraw our weapons earlier.”
By referring to their complaints to Washington, Pyongyang has in the past rejected a proposal to unilaterally withdraw nuclear weapons, citing their opposition to the North's promise to help them by reducing their nuclear weapons "in a phased manner."
In a joint statement issued after the first-ever meeting between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Trump recalled Kim's statement that "we will dismantle nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" and commit to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. wants them to first withdraw their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to take steps to lift severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is demanding that they first withdraw their nuclear weapons, trying to achieve this by force by imposing severe sanctions, and not even issuing a ""declaration that the war is over""," Rei said.
"The only people who know about us are those who don't know about us.
"But the lack of confidence is still growing."
A U.S. leader at the United Nations last week proposed a second meeting between Kim and Trump, but Rye did not comment.
But, speaking of five meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, he said: "It wouldn't have been so intimidating if there was more to these nuclear weapons withdrawals than the U.S.," he said.
Also, after Kim's suicide last year as "Rocket Man" and "Evil President", North Korea's missiles aimed at the mainland in the U.S. were required to be fired, compared to what Rye said at the U.N. General Assembly.
Trump, speaking at the United Nations last year, said he would "completely destroy" North Korea, noting that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea fully withdraws from its nuclear weapons program.
"It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months," Trump said on Wednesday.
Based on the steps taken so far, China and Russia have argued in the UN Security Council for some relief for Pyongyang.
However, Mike Pompeo, though a U.S. State of the Union, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Security sanctions must continue to be strictly enforced until we confirm full and permanent denuclearization of North Korea."
In 2006, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea to halt funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo, who met Rai at the UN General Assembly, said he would visit Pyongyang next month and prepare for a second round of talks.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit to the country did not go well.
Pompeo, who arrived from Pyongyang in July, said his trip went well within a few hours, saying he was "wanting to be like a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon last month, North Korea said that if the US took "the right steps," it would dismantle the missile center and nuclear weapons center.
He said the "right measures" were meant to guarantee security and establish good relations with Washington, as Trump said in Singapore.
Harvard students are being taught how to rest.
A new training course at Harvard University has begun this year, teaching students who drink caffeine throughout the night how to get enough rest at night.
Students don't even know how to take care of their health.
Sleep pill experts at Harvard Medical College, Charles Geisler, and Brigham and Women's Hospital together began this type of training for the first time in the U.S.
He wanted to start this training after discussing the problems that arise in education due to lack of sleep.
"""At the end of this training, a girl came to me and said, 'Why did you teach me this in my last year?'"
No one has ever told me the importance of sleep in the past, which is quite surprising," he told the Telegraph.
The training was started this year itself, showcasing how good sleep can improve overall health along with education and sports.
Paul Barreira, a professor in the department of mental health at Harvard Medical College, and executive director of the university's health services, said the decision to introduce the training came after it was learned that students were suffering from severe insomnia during the week.
The training will consist of one-hour interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be a dorm room, where students will be able to click on copy cups, curtains, trainers and books to explain how the sleep problem is caused by coffee and light, how it is affecting performance in sports, and the benefits of sleeping on time.
Another section explains how insomnia can increase the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
They should discuss their day-to-day tasks on a campus map with interactive symbols.
"We don't think it will immediately change the behavior of students.
But it's the public's right to know about the effects of smoking, and it's their right to know about it."
He said that the habit of 'reading all night' is already present and students are not able to sleep properly due to modern technology and day-to-day increasing stress, which is a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
He said that a good night's sleep can act as a "secret weapon" for students, preventing stress, dehydration, and anxiety, as well as allowing the brain to go into hunger mode.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemical and physical biology student who studied at Harvard last year, helped him create the training.
He said that the training has given him a good spirit and he wanted to extend it to the whole of the university.
Later, all post-graduate students will be asked to complete such training before enrolling in any competitive institution, he said.
"Students should not only be alarmed to go to sleep, but also to be alert to sleep, as your circadian rhythm may be disrupted by the ""blue light"" from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause sleep-related problems."
Living Stone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrad's team lost due to a Menga goal
Steven Gerrard was beaten 1-0 by Rangers in the second match of the day by Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga.
The Irbox team was looking for their first win since the 4-1 Trump victory at St. John's Stone in February, but Gary Holt surprised and Gerrad's team lost for the second time in 18 games, losing his eight-point adrift in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Meng tried for 7 minutes before half-time, but the Rangers couldn't give a proper match.
The Rangers have now moved up to sixth place, while Livingstone is behind Hibmian in third place with a goal difference.
Linesman column Spence was injured to the head due to an object being thrown rapidly, which became more of a problem for Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team during the Befford Cup semi-finals after the match with Ayer.
Halt, on the other hand, only played with the same Livy 11 that won everyone's hearts last week, and he was happy to see his opponents struggling every minute.
The Rangers may have dominated somewhat, but the Living Stone showed complete dominance when the ball was at their disposal.
The midfielder missed a good chance when Menga first sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor, otherwise they would have scored in under two minutes.
The ball came to Craig Holckett with a deep kick hit by Keegan Jacobs, but his defensive partner Allen Lithgow hit it away at the back post.
The Rangers took hold, but in the final third they seemed to play with hope rather than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos felt that the quarter-hour mark would be a penalty at the time of the collision between himself and Steven Lawless, but the Colombians' appeal was rejected by referee Steven Thomson.
The Rangers were able to only hit two first-half shots, but former IBrocks goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily intercepted the header and Tim Ove Azaria strikes made by Lasana Kaulibaly.
Everyone thought they had a chance to score in the 34th minute.
The Rangers failed again due to Deep Jacobs' set-piece.
Scott R. Field did not go there when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, which Menga sensibly scored.
Gerra sent Ryan Kent to replace Cowboy during the break, and the change seemed to have benefited Morales, although Kelly stopped it brilliantly.
Livingstone continued to play with Lithgow and Halkett's sweeps in a manner that was well-liked by visitors.
Holtside may have continued their lead in the final stages, but McGrogger blocked Jacobs before going from Corner to Lithgow.
Glenn Middleton, who was a subcontractor for the Rangers, also turned down Thomson's request for a penalty when he collided with Jacobs.
Panchang: Creator of the Geiger Counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Panchang: September 30, 1882, i.e. 136 years ago today ... Future Physicist Future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method of detecting and estimating radiation, which eventually evolved into a device called the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter is not only a major science instrument, but also a name in pop culture, used in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as scientists:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogues: "It detects radioactive minerals such as the Geiger counter, uranium, etc.."
If these earphones are worn, it will detect sounds coming from molecules due to the radioactivity present in the minerals."
Evans: "Hey, sound is coming!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his legacy will live on forever.
How to 'identify' bad cells with a new cancer vaccine can tell the immune system
How to 'identify' bad cells with a new cancer vaccine and how to kill them can tell the immune system
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize the bad cells as part of the treatment
As part of the procedure, immune cells are collected from the patient's body and converted into them in a lab.
They then 'identify' a protein that is common in many types of cancers and re-inject it.
The trial vaccine has shown positive results in patients with several types of cancer.
If a woman was treated with a vaccine that could tell the immune system the detection of bad cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in her for more than 18 months.
As part of this, a patient receives immune cells from the body and is trained in the lab to "identify" a protein that is present in many types of cancer, HER2, and re-inject those cells.
Professor Jay Berzafsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that our vaccine works well.”
Professor Berjafsky explained that "many types of cancers are growing" due to HER2, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal.
In the treatment of leukemia, a similar method of "teaching" the collection of immune cells and attacking cancer cells has worked.
Kanye West appeared on Pro-Trump Diatribe wearing a mega-hat after his SNL show.
It didn't go well.
Fans surrounded Kanye West in the studio after a long performance on Saturday Night Live praising U.S. President Trump and saying he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town that night, wearing a cap called Make America Great, he was once again a vocal supporter of Trump.
“Many times when I spoke to the White House, I was asked: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Trump shows racial discrimination, how did you support him?’
"Well, if I was thinking about racial discrimination, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched the show with a skit featuring Hollywood actor Matt Damon, mocking Brett Cavanaugh's trial in front of the Senate Judicial Committee over allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it didn't air, comedian Chris Rock only uploaded criticisms of West on social media.
It's obvious that the West is going to be criticized for this.
However, West also told his fans that he suffered a blow in the back of the stage due to his hat.
"They have insulted me.
He said, "Don't wear that hat."
They've embarrassed me.
"I'm on a sinking ship," he said.
West said: "Do you see the sinking boat?" and said, "I wear my Superman hat, which means they don't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
make love."
Twice the audience was ridiculed because of his comments, the SNL staff felt humiliated, and one of the presenters said: “The entire studio has become silent.”
Singer Ariana Grande, who suffered the death of her boyfriend Mac Miller, arrived in the West at the last minute.
Dressed up like a Periyar bottle, West took everyone by surprise by singing the song I Love It.
Kandas Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA in support of the West, tweeted: "One of the bravest: Thank you for speaking out for the people."
But, West is simply acting like he likes it, which is amazing," tweeted talk show host Karen Hunter.
"But I chose not to make any financial gain from anyone (by buying his music or clothing or art) who supports an ideology that could be dangerous to my society."
He's got freedom.
"We have the same freedom," he said.
Before the show, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, "now he's called Kanye West."
Many artists have changed their names after Diddy changed his name to Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was known as Snoop Lion, as well as the legendary musician Prince who changed his name to Prince, who was formerly known as Prince.
A murder case has been registered in connection with the incident
On Friday, a 45-year-old woman was charged with assaulting a man with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast.
The incident took place in Mumbai, police said.
The accused will be produced before the court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has been criticised for his toxic masculinity.
Kit played the role of John Snow, a sword fighter in HBO's Wild Medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor believes that young people are being misled into thinking that the stereotyping seen in the movies could be the same in real life due to the role of the hero Macho.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, he said, "Something went wrong" and how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of <0x23>MeToo controversy.
Kitt was recently married to her co-star Rose Leslie in Game of Thrones, who is also 31 years old and he is "thinking very seriously" about the issue.
"""Personally, I'm fine, but what is society going to do about mask-wearing?"""
“What do we teach our children about the problems we see today?”
Kitt said television may be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity and the rise of masculinity.
He said, "What are we going to learn?
What do you think about the way young people are portrayed on TV?
How to deal with this is one of the most important questions of our time.
It is clear that something is wrong with the youth.'
"The series will be completed in the summer of next year, after which I won't be acting in Game of Thrones sequels or prequels, just wars and horses," he said.
From the kit number is set to return Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, plus he's also a bandit.
It's great to meet my wife in the game of thrones.
"I met my wife at the event, which meant that I created my family, and now I will continue to do this," he said.
Rose played the love interest of John Snow in the Emmy-award-winning fantasy series.
They got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases rise by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people across the country have been affected by the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases.
As in the past, most of them are sexually transmitted.
Traditionally, however, some parts of China have been infected by infected blood transfusions.
But Chinese health officials said at a meeting in the Yunnan region that the number of people infected with the virus has almost reached zero.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is growing at the rate of 100,000.
HIV infection is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was declared a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT increased.
Because of the country's traditional values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many of these relationships are infected due to lack of proper protection in the context of sexual activity.
As part of addressing this problem, the Chinese government has been providing HIV drugs to everyone since 2003.
Maxine Waters has denied that one of the crew members leaked the data of GOP senators, calling them "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff posted the personal information of Republican U.S. Senators on the page of the Lameers Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the news was being done by "Ultra Right Wing" pundits and on the website.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "Lies, lies, and ugly lies."
The released information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill while the Senate panel was investigating allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday.
The information was leaked after being questioned by three senators.
"Conservatives such as Gateway Pandit and Wed State claimed that the IP address that leaked this information belonged to the Waters office, and one of the Waters staff members released the information,"" Hill said."
"This allegation is completely unfounded," he said.
"Because of these baseless allegations, the identity and personal information of one of my staff have been made completely public, but the person has nothing to do with it.
"This denial is completely unwarranted."
Several people, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleacher, criticized the Waters statement online.
"She's angry," he wrote.
"She doesn't want to be a member of Congress.
When they are angry, they will not be angry.
They should not resist.
They should not question the motives of the accused person.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
Fleishcher compared Waters' response and the Democrats' criticism that Cavano was too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who wants to replace Waters in the midterm elections, responded on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very important," he said.
"We have informed the relevant authorities and legal entities about these fraudulent charges," Waters said in a statement.
"We will catch the people who have leaked", she said, "This has caused a lot of embarrassment not only to me but also to my staff, so those responsible will be severely punished in accordance with law."
Johnny English Strikes Again <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Rowan Atkins’ Spy Spook Disappoints
Brexit has been mentioned in all of the British Splant's films in the recent past, including Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
If we're going to talk about immigration, how badly do we want to be treated as a country?
However, the middle-aged, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English is a humorous character designed for non-English-speaking movie lovers who are now coming to the audience for a second time.
He is a Daft Secret Agent who, with his odd behaviors, tries to make himself look like a close-up, i.e. Mr. Bean-like character, which was somewhat helpful during the Chariot of Fire theme during the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally it was based on the travel, International Man of Misery Atkinson, which had been featured in previous bar-cl<0xC3><0xA9>card TV commercials, but people forgot about it because of its lack of accuracy.
There are a couple of good ones in the JV.
I had the pleasure of going to the Johnnie English helicopter wearing a medieval-era dress, swords, and helmet.
The Atkinson Prize now looks like a form of physical comedy, but it's not all that good, as is comedy in the "Series" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible these days.
It's a comedy designed not for adults but for kids, in my opinion Pratik Atkinson's Silente-Movie had a bean personality, but his mad antics in Johnny English didn't impress much.
The saddest part of this story is that Britain is in trouble.
Kevin Eldon played the role of a cyber-attacker who infiltrated Britain's spy super secret web network, gave information to all British agents, threatening an agent on duty, and to an agent from a hostile country.
This is the biggest problem for a prime minister who is already facing complete political opposition: Emma Thomson played the role of Quasi Theresa May brilliantly, but her role in the script is of little importance.
All the active spies have been compromised, her intelligence advisers suggest to her that someone should be brought from among those who have retired.
It's none other than our Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster and teaches children how to become an undercover spy: Here's the fun, he teaches about spy at a rock-type academy.
English is immediately brought to the White Hall for an emergency meeting, where his old sidekick meets Boone again, played by Ben Miller.
Bowie is now married and working as a sub-marine commander, and the role of Jolly-Hockey-sticks in Vicky Pepper Dine is somewhat underwhelming.
The Batman, Robin, who always makes mistakes in the Queen's Secret Service, returns, where he meets the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, Lake Lacey plays Jason Volta, a notorious tech billionaire who is trying to solve a computer hacking mystery in Britain.
Both English and Bau perform a variety of stunts, set on fire a French restaurant working as waiters, smuggled into the luxury yacht of Volta, creating confusion for Ingli Nana, who wears virtual reality to get to know Volta's home.
All of this is done for the sake of the last sequence, which, no matter how beautiful and vivid it is, is like a child's TV for the whole.
The fine modeling.
I can't remember much of the other Johnny English films, but isn't the British film industry really doing justice to his talent in the role of Atkinson?
"Labour is not looking for a four-day work week for its employees in the UK
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a plan in which employees in Britain can work four days and get five days' salary.
The party has asked the company's employers to share the money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) with employees by giving them a day's extra leave.
Employees are entitled to three days off a week, but there is no difference in salary.
It will 'fit' the party's economic agenda, as well as make the country all-out in support of its employees.
The union also said that the change in the economy will benefit employees in a four-day work week.
A senior Labour leader told The Sunday Times: "Some policy will be reviewed before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a party policy that will benefit employees while maintaining a balance in the economy, so that the industry plan for Parry is also successful.”
The Green Party is the first party to support the idea since the time of the 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party does not support this idea.
A Labour spokesperson said: 'The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not being looked into by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his idea of social revolution in the economic sector at a Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he wants to take back power from "invisible directors" and "profit-earners" in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor also said that the Labour government is likely to impose "cuts" based on wrong decisions so that the existing shareholders of water companies may not get back the same level of shares.
He also said that companies with annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 should set up comprehensive ownership funds and give 10 per cent to employees.
The FBI's investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh changed its mind when Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes."
The Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has been delayed by at least a week because of the FBI investigation of the charges, which involves a Bureau of Investigation investigation into whether any Republican senators supported them.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham questioned John Kennedy in an interview Sunday with "60 Minutes" Rep. Scott Pillay.
Kennedy spoke more clearly than his colleg, a native of South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I was in prison, I talked to Kenny.
"After the allegation was made, I called him and asked, ""Did you do that?"""
He spoke clearly and boldly."
Graham is the only one with a consistent view.
"My opinion of Kavanaugh is consistent, and it's not going to change that easily," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly condemned it," said Graham.
"We can't listen to everything he says.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, due to which poverty is reduced?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, where many stars will perform and raise awareness of the need to end poverty.
This seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park's Great Lawn will feature stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, as well as explain how to end the world's greatest poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was announced in 2012 as a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, which aims to combat global poverty.
To get a free ticket (if you don't need a VIP ticket), those attending the event will need to do a few tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, a phone call, or some other form of awareness about poverty alleviation.
There are only 12 years left to achieve this goal, and what is the success rate of the global citizenry today?
Do you really think that giving free tickets to those who make phone calls is going to be a big deal, or is it just "click TV" like signing online petitions or sending out tweets?
Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters since 2011, with several targets being reached.
These actions have resulted in a number of pledges and policies by world leaders, which they say amount to $37 billion to help 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, they say they had distributed or raised up to $10 billion due to 390 assurances and advertising actions.
So far, 649 million people have benefited from safe havens around the world.
Some key assurances are that after more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, The Power of Nutrition, investors and implementers in the U.K. said they would "provide adequate nutrition for children" and promised $35 million to Rwanda, a country suffering from malnutrition.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and other global citizens, we can destroy the social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracer ul-Mann, the power of nutrition ambassador at a live broadcast concert in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 steps to improve nutrition in the U.K., the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition several programs that will ensure proper nutrition for 5 million women and children.
One of the FAQs on their website is “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?” in answer to the question
The Global Citizen replied: "It's a long, hard road, sometimes to get down, sometimes to fail.
But, like the movements for rights and anti-apartheid struggles of the past, we too will triumph in unity with great power.
This year's event in New York will feature Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, who will be hosted by Deborra Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses its navy to "stop" Russian energy exports <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Interior Secretary
Washington will use its navy to prevent Russia from entering markets such as the Middle East "if necessary," said U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke.
He said Russia was actively participating in Syria only to reach out to new energy markets.
"Russia wants to sell its energy in southern Europe, like in eastern Europe, and that's why it wants to enter the Middle East," he said.
According to him, there are ways to deal with it.
"The U.S. Navy has the ability to open and close the sea lanes when needed, when not needed, to keep them from entering those markets of energy," he said.
Jinke made the remarks at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which calls itself an "energy consumer organization" in the US.
He said there would be no major change in Washington's dealings with Russia and Iran.
“Both Iran and Russia are making money from almost the sale of fuel,” he said, while Russia is a country that is entirely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments came at a time when the Trump administration is trying to sell its liquefied natural gas to Russia in place of Europe, but it is likely to be the cheapest available to European consumers.
For this, his government has been under total pressure, including Trump, to pull Germany out of the "endless" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, a project that he has called Berlin Moscow "possessive."
Moscow has stated several times that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is purely an economic project to double the existing 110 billion cubic meters of capacity.
The Kremlin said Washington's attempt to block the project was purely for economic benefit, not competition.
"We shouldn't put pressure on using energy products, they should have the right to choose the suppliers of their choice," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. rejected the proposal, concluding that we would continue with the project.
The German Confederation of Industry (BDI), a leading industry body in Germany, said the US should not interfere in EU energy policy and should stay away from the ongoing bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Confederation of Industry (BDI) President Dieter Kemp said, "We do not like the interference of a third country in our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says there is "opportunity" to participate in the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that there was "opportunity" for her to take part in the 2020 presidential election after the midterm elections.
In a town hall in Holloway, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would be able to take part in the election.
"Women should enter Washington, mend our chaotic government, and women should be prioritized," she said.
"After November 6, I will think about the presidential election."
Trump is taking our country in the wrong direction.
"It's destroying our democracy," he said.
Warren has been publicly critical of Trump and Cavano, the Supreme Court nominee.
"The FBI needs an investigation before the vote," she said in a tweet on Friday.
A survey released on Thursday showed that most people in Warren's own constituency think she won't be in the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Survey, 58% of Massachusetts voters who said "maybe" said they would not vote for her.
Thirty-two percent supported it.
Former Gov. Deval Patrick received the most support in the survey, with 38 percent saying it was probably, while 48 percent saying it was against.
The names of other prominent Democrats, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, came up for debate for the 2020 election.
"I will make a formal decision in January," Biden said.
Sarah Palin, who participated in the Trump rally, mentioned Track Palin's PTSD
The 26-year-old, who registered in September, has been in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence.
"I understand what happened to my son, what kind of problems he had when he came back home, what kind of post-PTSD happened when some of our soldiers who worked for the country returned home," she told a crowd at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palina said his arrest was a "white elephant in the room" and that he and his son and the other war heroes would be "very different and tough" when they returned, leaving little doubt whether they and their fellow soldiers and their families would receive enough respect for the sacrifice they had made for this country.
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and a report of assault on a woman, alleged involvement in a domestic violence case, and alleged use of weapons in drunkenness, said a spokesman for Wasilla police, Dan Bennett.
Under the new refugee policy, 18 states are supporting a lawsuit against the D.C.
English states and the District of Columbia are legally challenging a new policy designed to prevent gangs or domestic violence from entering the U.S.
Cases filed Friday in Washington on behalf of refugees protesting the new policy are being supported by representatives from 18 states and one district, NBC News reported.
The names of those who filed a lawsuit against the federal policy in August under the name of the American Civil Liberties Union during Grace v. Sessions are not known.
I was sexually abused by my husband and the "sons of his brutal gang member," but on July 20, my asylum application was rejected by U.S. authorities.
She was taken to Texas.
The attorney supporting Grace said many people are making applications for being U.S. refugees from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom have been victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
This new policy reversed the 2014 refugee policy that allowed victims of domestic violence to seek asylum in the U.S. even without documents.
The new policy "ignored decades of state, federal, and international law," said General Carl Reynin, a District Attorney for the District of Columbia.
"Under federal law, when an incident is reported to have occurred, it is mandatory to prove that the incident occurred and was in violation of the rules," the friend-of-court said.
The U.S. economy has been battered by this policy of refusing refugees, who are likely to become merchants and "supply-needed labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the judge not to allow anyone to become victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Speaking about the policy on June 11, Sessions said, "Only those arriving due to violence or intimidation on account of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion should be considered refugees."
The refugee policy has not been designed to address the problems that occur every day around the world, at least not the most serious issues that have been taken into account.
The death toll in Palu continues to rise and the search for survivors continues
The condition of the injured is deteriorating.
Risa Kusumah, a 35-year-old mother at a rehab facility in Palu, held her child with a fever in her hand and said, "The situation is becoming very dire."
"The bodies are coming in ambulances every minute.
There's no water."
Locals are trying to reach their houses and fetch water.
Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds injured as a result of the earthquake.
Even after the earthquake, the military is treated outside the hospital in Palu, so one of those waiting outside is Dwy Harris, who has a fractured spine and a shoulder.
He was found dead in a hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to protect ourselves.
"I'm stuck between the walls," Harris told The Associated Press, speaking to The Associated Press.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then everything went quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are well."
The U.S. ambassador accused China of <0xE2><0x80><0x98>disgusting’ with <0xE2><0x80><0x98>propaganda ads’
A week ago, a Chinese newspaper published a four-page statement detailing the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, in which the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using U.S. newspapers to promote a propaganda campaign.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which he had previously accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 election.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump had accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election as part of Washington's efforts to further pressure China.
It is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to boost business, but Washington and Beijing are currently raising tariffs on each other's imports in a phased manner.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said that the earlier hikes in tariffs as part of China's retaliatory measures affected exporters in states such as Lova, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, currently the U.S. ambassador to China, has long been the governor of Lowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, but he said that American workers, farmers and traders are suffering because of China.
Writing in the Des Mones Register on Sunday, he said: "China is now complicating the problem by using our own freedom of expression and publishing propaganda propaganda."
"China is using the freedom of the press and freedom of expression that the U.S. mainstream believes in to take over its own territory, and that's why it's publishing paid advertisements in the U.S. press."
"In stark contrast, there is no real freedom of the press in Beijing, and no one can openly express their views on the problems of China's economic sector, because the press is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
"One of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish my article," he said, but did not name the paper.
Republicans have been pushing for women's suffrage in the midterm elections.
Many Republicans are speaking out in support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault, so they will have a setback and will alienate women voters in the midterm elections, analysts warn.
There is a lot of controversy surrounding this, and a lot of Republicans are already saying that voting is important to them.
We can't fix things like that," said Grant Reiffer, a professor of compromising science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Rehrer doubted that the FBI would be able to pacify angry voters by asking Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget today, they will not forget tomorrow, they will not forget in November," said Kerin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for Progressive Group MoveOn.
Mike said Republicans pressured the Judiciary Committee to maintain Kavanaugh's nomination regardless of the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, while protesters in the Hallway of the Senate chanted "November is coming!" on Friday morning.
"The enthusiasm and spirit of the Democrats is also going behind the scenes," non-partisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told a news site.
"Everyone says it's already been taken to extremes; it's true.
But it can still grow, especially among suburban and young female voters in the age group of 18 to 29, who usually don't vote at all if the president doesn't like it."
Analysts say that if Republicans continue to hold the confirmation even before the sexual assault on the Ford Public Ka Supreme Court nominee, it will have a far-reaching impact.
"It's made it look like a mess in the GOP," former president Michael Steele told the Republican National Committee early last week, according to NBC News.
"Whether the committee vote or the final vote or the caucus is put on the bench or not is not the real issue," said G Cecil, director of a group called Priorities USA, who helped pick the Democrats when speaking to a news channel.
However, there are disagreements among Americans who have seen the announcements of Ford and Cavano about the controversy, perhaps believing that the majority of them are not.
A new survey conducted by YouGov found that 41 per cent of participants believe what Ford is saying is true, while 35 per cent believe what Ford is saying is absolutely or perhaps not true.
Similarly, only 38 percent believe the lie is probably true, while 30 percent say Ford is a liar.
At Flake's request, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another man, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been sexually assaulted by an alcoholic when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that Cavano showed me his genitals when he went to a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web is expected to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The company, Inrupt, is being built on the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
In Solid, users can decide where to store their data and who should have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee bluntly said that Inrupt was "to rule the world."
He said, "You have to do it now."
"This is a historic event."
Solid technology is used in the app, through which users can create their own "Personal Online Data Store" or POD.
This includes contact lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal online data store is that users can decide who can access their information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The company's CEO, John Bruce, said the Inrupt was created to create the resources, process, and appropriate skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce from IBM, some on-staff workers working on the project in contract form, and some volunteer coders.
Since its inception, decentralized apps have been developed by technology developers around the world using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said: "My team and I haven't talked to them to decide whether or not to fully launch this project that could change Facebook and Google's business models overnight.
"We don't want their permission."
In a post on Saturday's Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is "working to provide the commercial energy and ecosystem needed to protect the integrity and quality of the new web that is being created in Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 by launching the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been at the forefront of Net Neutrality talks in recent months.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm working very optimistic for the coming web era," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Recalling the WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric
The Church of England is the only church in England to have won the Victoria Cross during the First World War, so it is now celebrated 100 years after the event.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded for his role in the attacks at Bellingleys and Lehigh Court on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later a sniper shot him dead, leaving him unaware that at least he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, his two grandsons inaugurated a memorial in his memory in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
His grandson, Michael Wan, said the memorial was started as a "beautiful symbol" exactly 100 years after our grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, he led his battalion through the Canal de St. Quentin, "between thick smoke and machine guns."
He immediately went to the front line, fired with a "wonderful gallantry" and fired three detachments with a single hand.
Van Dyke was killed in a German sniper fire on 4 October 1918, just months before the end of the war.
"I know some of my grandfather's adventures, I can't do such adventures, but I'd be proud to have them," said his grandson, 72-year-old Michael Wan.
He and his brother, Dr. James, also placed a wreath at the parade, in which Brent Wood participated in the Imperial Youth Band.
"It was a pleasure to be part of the parade," said Michael Vaughan, "to once again be remembered for his service and support to that true hero."
MMA fans waited all night to see the Bellator 206, but they instead saw the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been turned down to watch the main event after you've waited all night to see the packed Belator 206.
The San Jose bill includes 13 flights, six on Mail Card and a nightly broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK.
Spectators in the UK were taken by surprise when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were nearly face-to-face at 6 a.m. when Kavarezi suddenly switched to Peppa Pig in the time to come.
Many were disappointed, especially those who waited for the flight until morning.
Let's take a look at the children's cartoon, a fan on Twitter said, "It's a big joke."
"It's not the right content to display at 6 a.m. as a government rule, so it's showing a children's program," Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Puppy, yeah.
Scott Cocker, president of the Bellator company, said: "We will adjust our times to focus on the UK audience in the future.
"I think we can do it," Coker said.
"Now there's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't work on this until we get it up on a Sunday in our time, which means it becomes Monday in their time."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of text messages when I switched to this, they weren't all so friendly.
We are trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical issue.
But it is not the government's problem.
I assure you this will not happen again.
We usually show up at five o'clock rather than six, we wanted to show up at a huge, lastly empty.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Is 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympic Diver Tom Daley said he grew up with infidelity because of his sexuality since childhood, but that was the only reason he was able to succeed.
I didn't know that "all was not like me" until I went to secondary school.
Speaking at the First Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said: "I speak publicly only to "give hope" to others.
"When I became a father, I didn't care much about the Olympics.
The cause of death of this young man has been known for a long time.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD>, who was castaway on the first show of the Laverns, said that he was "less" than anyone else, and as a child he said, "If I hadn't been like the boys and girls, I'd have felt that society wouldn't accept me."
He said: “Today, the feeling that I am less than everyone else, that I am not like everyone else has gone, that I have got real strength and strength, and it is with them that I have achieved this success.”
"I wanted to prove that there was something in me," he said, so no one was disappointed when he told me about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist, he became a prominent LGBT campaigner and participated in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that to live a life free of secrets is a blessing and I want to give the same hope to others.
I was "surprised" to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, a three-time world champion and a US filmmaker whom I met in 2013.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> is married to an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, and age has never been an issue between us, he said.
"It was all watched from a young age" - he said, adding that he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14, so it was difficult to find someone who was the same age and faced the same problems as me.
In June, the couple gave birth to a baby boy, Robert Ray Black Dale, and later said his "vision angle" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said, 'All I care about is winning a gold medal.'
"You know, there are things bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal."
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said his father could not digest the fact that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he still had tickets to the London 2012 Olympics - he wanted to sit in the front row.
I told him, "You can't be my father."
"When he stopped breathing, I held his hand, and in fact, he stopped breathing completely, and I did not accept defeat until he died," he said.
The following year, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I know it's something I've dreamed about all my life - diving in front of the compatriots at the Olympic Games, I don't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which inspired him in his Olympic pursuits, while still making the song a keeper of the roms for him.
The Desert Island Discs will air Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Michaelson was not able to play in the Ryder Cup on Saturday due to a lack of form
American Phil Michael Son will set a record with his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he should be back on form if that doesn't turn out to be a tragic milestone.
Michaelson, who is playing for a record-breaking 12th time in the biennial event, was replaced by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
He was never a key player on the United States team, scoring five times as a key success, split his day between being a cheerleader and improving the game to correct his mistakes in his range.
One of the drivers who didn't play directly even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old Michaelson, is not ideal for the tight-leaf golf national course, where the ground is a long ruff that is awkward for arching shots.
Also, if not enough effort, Michaelson will face defending British Open champion Francisco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points lower, start 12 singles matches and get off to a fantastic start, Michaelson's match will certainly prove to be a crucial one.
Furyk confided in his player that he couldn't say much more.
"He understood his role today, hugged me, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and he has brought a great name to these teams in the past, as well as this week.
I don't think he played two games.
I thought for the most part, but that approach worked, and we wanted to continue to do so.
He wanted everyone to be there."
Michaelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most appearances in a Ryder Cup match on Sunday.
It could be the end of a rider's cup career that doesn't match his personal record at all.
While Furyk has said his presence added elements of the team's underdogs, Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-siblings.
"He's fun, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes entertaining people, and he's in the room that provides good entertainment," he explained.
"I think it's fun for young players to criticize him, and I think it's fun to watch, too, this week.
He's not just playing, he's playing a lot."
European Captain Thomas Jorne knew that a great leadership would soon come to an end
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant lead into singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily become uncomfortable.
Dane made his debut in a Waldorf Rama match in 1997, where a team led by Seve Balesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just reached the finish line with a nose, winning the Americans by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we have a big lead at Valderrama; we have a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won," said Bourne, who won 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday after watching the 2018 class and was leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over.
You will use your full potential.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, so the focus should be on that.
I've always said that I'm going to focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but I know we have the best players in the world on the other side."
Delighted at his players' performance on the rough golf course, Bjorn said: "I can't cross myself on this one.
Tomorrow is another test.
Tomorrow's events will be different.
It's great to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're there in person, you'll be able to fully test your potential as a golfer.
"The message you have to tell all the players is to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner and let him go and play for the best of himself."
Unlike Jorne, rival Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better in person than in partnership, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four, being the exception.
Furyk himself was among the two teams that did wonders on the final day, as part of the winning team at Brookline, a player who saw defeat in the European team due to a break from "Miracle at Medina."
In 1999, when asked how he assembled his players for the final day, Captain Ben Crenshaw replied, "I remember every damn word of it."
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you're going to want to start fast as you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When that pace continues, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and how we prepared the guys, we're trying to do the magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the fightback, taking on Rory McIlroy in a top match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the order.
"I didn't put these guys in this order because I thought it was good in all aspects," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship has been delayed once again.
The German Navy's newest frigate was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace obsolete Cold War-era warships, but local media reported that it would not happen until at least next year due to poor land degradation systems and rising costs.
The "Reinland-Falz" commission, the main ship of the newest Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues changed the fate of the prestigious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered back by the Navy in 2007, will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
Among their features, there are some stealth technologies such as anti-aircraft range and anti-ship missiles as well as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
One of the other important features is long maintenance periods - it is possible to deploy new warships from home ports up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art battleships - a force Germany wanted to show abroad - would be already outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit said.
With the German Navy officially refusing to commission the vessel and returning it to Bloem & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg, the ill-fated F125 was one of last year's highlights.
This is the first time that the completed ship has been returned to the Navy ship builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the battleship useless if it was used in battle.
Software flaws are critical as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships and the old Bremen class frigates were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors who were only half of the manpower.
Also, the ship's weight has increased dramatically, which can damage its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add updates in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Reinland-Falz" is said to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from hardware with flaws, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is becoming an issue.
It started at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion and went up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling, the problems of the new warships have assumed importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defence committee, agreed that the navy would actually "reduce the number of expansion-capable ships."
The official said that the issue has become serious over time as old ships have been scrapped but no replacement ships have been provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships had been able to join the naval fleet.
The Secret Life of Bees National Trust
New research is being done on an estate in the Scottish Highlands, revealing how bats use their physical surroundings to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of distinctive flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be conducted at the Inverreve Gardens in West Ross on common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and dabenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the study area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A skilled sound analysis of all recordings will determine the severity of bat screams and what species are doing what.
The Habitat Map and Report are designed to create a dynamic landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that these results will reveal what areas are most important to bats and how they can benefit each species.
This information will help you learn the benefits of habitat management tasks, such as managing woodlands for bats and other allied species, from forming grass.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are in danger due to building and development works affecting the livelihoods and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a hazard, as well as attacks by flypapers and certain chemical treatments such as building materials, as well as pet cats.
The bugs aren't really bad.
However, due to their nomadic hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use an advanced eco-location approach to identify mites and obstacles in the way they fly.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, considers bats to be very important.
They have ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, checks, and sometimes even rescues.
The company set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Dumfries and the Threve Estate in Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the estate was the perfect home for them.
He said, "We have a good home for bats here at Trevey."
"We have old buildings, high numbers of trees and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the things we do here and at other research sites can be useful in understanding more about what they're still growing into."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance at a place, as destroying a roost unknowingly could result in the death of 400 female bats and children, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats have legal protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or trouble them or destroy their roosts.
Elizabeth Ferre, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, also involved people to help.
She said: “There’s still a lot we need to know about our bats and we don’t know how their population is growing in relation to most species.”
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of sexual assault by a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations against him, saying that they "want to increase the campaign" using his name, calling them "false news."
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward are accused of raping an American woman, Katherine Mayoruga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he had paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
A few hours after the allegations were made, in a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced it as "false news."
No, no, no, no, no.
"All they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm happy, everything is fine," he said.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit over the allegations, which they call "a report of unacceptable suspicions regarding personal privacy," Reuters said.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said he would seek "an amount of moral damages commensurate with the severity of the breach, which is one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Ares Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor went back to the player's room where he raped her.
Ronaldo fell to his knees after that incident, saying that he was "99 percent a good person" and that this was due to a "one percent" mistake.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sex between the two, but it was done with the consent of both.
Mayorga also said she had gone to the police, claiming that the hospital had photos of her injuries taken, but later said she had "taken revenge" and, fearing "insults," had agreed to settle outside of court.
The 34-year-old Myorga has said that she wants to withdraw the settlement due to the mental agony caused by the incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, when he joined the Italian giants Juve this summer with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: 'The UK will forever regret the loss of carmakers'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota told the UK BBC it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnuston, near Derby, if Britain pulled out of the EU without a deal.
"We need to make a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that any slight delay in the no-deal Brexit event could result in the loss of jobs.
The Barnaston plant - which makes the Toyota Aros and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, we will take action to stop production at our factory," Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director, said.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about whether the cross-border trade on leaving the EU without a deal will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns expressed by car manufacturers in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit are related to supply chain disruption.
Toyota's production process is running on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving from suppliers in both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes, completing car orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, leading to delays and shortages in car parts, the industry says.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore stop production.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkers plan for the EU's future relations was "made to avoid such uncertainties at the border."
“We have to have a deal. Not only will we enjoy this opportunity, we will embrace this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The evidence from manufacturers other than Toyota is that the supply chain needs to continue to plan successfully."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but said it would no longer be able to do so, adding to the additional costs, reducing the plant's competitiveness, and eventually losing jobs.
Peter Tsoullaran, a United Union convener at the plant for 24 years, and his members are concerned about these things: "Once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We will prepare a definite and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein likely to be postponed
Donald Trump's high-pitched meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "will be postponed by another week" as the Supreme Court continues its fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Meller, a special counsel who investigated Russian election interference, links between Trump's followers and Russia, and the obstruction to justice by the president.
For the past few months, there has been a debate about whether removing Trump's deputy attorney general from his job would affect Mueller's freedom.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein's report was rejected.
He returned to the White House on Monday after receiving news of his resignation.
On Thursday, he met with President Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he didn't want to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "No date has been set, this week, there is a possibility of another week being postponed as there are other matters relating to the Supreme Court."
But we'll see, and I always like to give the press the latest details."
That claim may not have been accepted by some reporters: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The Lord Jesus Christ asked why.
Sanders said TV reporters were told that their "grandstanding" was not because they didn't like the news, but she also said: "I don't disagree with the idea that they're superior."
She said she would continue to improve the relationship between the three men.
"The president has had more Q&A meetings than any president before him," she added, without any evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
Sanders said the briefings would still happen, but "if the press had a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it would be far better than talking to me."
We're going to try to make that happen, and you've seen a lot of what we've been doing over the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the President of the United States, it replaces a press briefing position."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in press conferences with celebrities who have come to attend public events or conferences.
It's not enough to have a press conference.
"In New York this week, the president probably explained why he didn't follow the rules and stay in front of reporters without any information.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit
In a letter to the EU staff working on the NHS in Scotland, the health secretary thanked the country and expressed her desire to remain with them even after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Jean Freeman MSP six months after he left the UK.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay the cost of settled applications for EU citizens working in its segregated service sectors.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are ongoing, moving towards decisions being made this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scheme.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that the contribution of each and every one of the staff irrespective of their nationality is highly valued.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond have brought with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the way we work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
We want you to be here, and we want you to be here."
Christine Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent surgery for a head injury when he lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
"He came to the side line and collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff put him on a stretcher and provided oxygen at the side line to Abercrombie before taking him for further tests.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that he had undergone Abercrombie surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "there are no details yet on the type/ severity of the injury", and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt secondary student, was in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his overall season score to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers charge higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and use that extra money to help the homeless under new tory plans.
This move will neutralise the success of the carbine drive that has been made to attract young voters
Non-citizens in the UK are subject to a higher tax rate.
The Treasury expects it to grow to up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May is set to announce today that foreign buyers will charge higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and use that extra money to help the homeless.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's affordable housing and high-income pledges drive success to attract more young voters.
A higher stamp duty is imposed on individuals and entities that do not pay taxes in the UK, contributing to the government's efforts to combat excess money laundering.
The surcharge - which is introduced on second homes in addition to the existing stamp duty and which can be added including the higher charges introduced on buy-to-letes two years ago - can be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects to collect an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
The purchase by non-UK residents of 13 per cent of the newly built London assets, raised prices and made it difficult for first-time buyers to dream of owning a home.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "cemeteries" because most foreign buyers who do not live in the country have bought houses here.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a further increase in stamp duty for young people to own their first home.
Large construction companies have been accused of exorbitantly raising property prices by buying land and not using it, and Mrs. May has been asked to take down quotas on low-priced homes to address Britain's "home shortage."
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent controls and "no-fault" exits.
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my premiership to reviving the British dream of 'Life should be better for every new generation.'
Our goal is to grow our local market.
The UK has always been welcoming to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it can't be said that it's much easier to buy homes for people who don't live in the UK as well as foreign-based companies like hard-working British residents.
"A lot of people are in denial, and it's a reality that can't be ignored."
Jack Ross: 'It's my ultimate goal to run Scotland'
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott has taken on the challenge of renovating the North-East club, which is currently ranked third in League One.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer after mentoring St Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-Cap, that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my dad as a child. It’s always something that catches me.
That's the only way I'm going to be successful."
Prior to Ross, he was the manager of Sunderlands with Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Palo di Canio.
The former Allova Athletic owner felt that there was no delay in following such great teams in such a big club after he had previously rejected statements from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"""Can I return this club to the Premier League?""
"It's definitely a part of the club's history and the club's history," he said.
"If I can bring the club back, it will be a success, but it will not be an easy task."
As an assistant boss at Dumbarton and after 15 months on the heart's coaching staff, Ross has just turned three years into his management career.
He helped Alva recover from the relegation to the third level as well as turning Saint Mirren from the edge of the relegation line into championship title winners the following season.
Ross said he feels much more comfortable now than he did in his playing career at Clyde, Heart Pool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
He said: "It's probably a combination of two different approaches.
"I really believe that management is better for me than playing.
I've made good income and enjoyed some good successes, which sounds strange because that's all I've gotten a little bit better progress.
But it can be hard to play.
You have a lot of things to do each week.
Management seems to be right despite the pressures of the job.
I've been very comfortable with my presence all my adult life. I've always wanted to do maintenance and now I'm doing it."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Sport Sound on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The survey found that the ideal time for a pint was 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
Summer heats increased the takings of pubs in Britain's loss, but put more pressure on restaurants.
Sales of pub and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent in July - but take-off in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultancy, who compiled the statistics, said: "More sunlight and England's longer participation in the World Cup have resulted in a 2.8 percent increase in the revenue of pubs compared to June the previous month, except that restaurants have been hit more severely.
Restaurant trade fell 1.8% in the month of July.
Drink-led pubs and bars have given a strong performance with what they like more than restaurants.
While not as dramatic as restaurant operators, pubs that have been a food key business have also been affected this summer.
People want to go out for a drink.
Drink sales of maintained pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent, while food decreased by three percent."
Rest and hospitality analysts RSM Paul Newman said: "These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events tend to be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It's no surprise that despite the ongoing cost pressures and a 4.8 per cent year-on-year decline in sales, restaurant groups continue to struggle.
There will be no more time for food-borne operators during the longer hot summer months, and the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will tell us whether or not we will be able to deliver a much-needed rate of return."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slow down in the brand's roll-outs.
Founded as an industry benchmark, Coffer Peach Tracker Industry UK, a sales monitor from the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, ensuring that the total turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children have a social media account without their parents' knowledge.
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 years old - had hidden secret social media accounts from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed a growth in fake insta pages.
Elidh Doyle, will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eild Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - are creating social media accounts that are kept secret from adults.
The photo-sharing site's Instagram abbreviated name - "Fake Instagram" saw a rapid growth in a survey of 20,000 secondary school students on accounts.
The threat of sexual harassment has increased.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean "main" account to show to their parents, as well as a private one.
A mother found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter in which she was surprised to see a young woman asking others to "rape me."
The research, digitally savvy UK and headmasters of the "and Head Mistress Infidelity" Conference (HMC) independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s a disturbing thing that so many teenagers are searching in a way that parents and teachers can’t find in creating online spaces.”
Elidh Doyle, will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eild Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade as a great opportunity for sportsmen to benefit.
Beatty said, "Elyde has a great deal of respect for Scottish, UK and world athletics and we are sure the athletics in Scotland will benefit the most by bringing her on board".
Doyle said: “I’m eager to be a voice for the athletes and I’m hoping that I can really contribute and help them lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, between his four Olympic golds, was now able to walk after a brief ischemic attack, a simple BBC pudit.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I had a stroke.
I cant walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or reach any level.
Even though it was hard work, I made a full recovery, learning how to walk again, and I'm practicing to be active today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
The breast pump ad compares mothers to cows, on which online dissent has been polled
A breast pump company has gained controversy online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of what could be said to be "the world's first silent, wearable breast pump," consumer tech company LV Tung-in-Cheek Music has released a video-inspired statement, showcasing the freedom the new pump gives mothers in an expression.
Four real mothers tie the cows and dance in a haystack: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, these aren't the potters, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed it to the kids, pump it, pump it, I’m milking it.”
However, the company's Facebook page has been the subject of controversy.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from the audience, with many of them commenting that it brings to light the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is not a good idea at all.
Like us, they should also conceive and give birth to produce milk, which their babies will abstain from within a few days of delivery."
The breast pump inside the nursing bra (LV/mother) is properly fitted.
Another commented: "It's a very sad thing for both mother and child.
Why don't we use the Bible to warn our children?
Another added: "A statement that does not give priority to emotions."
Others defended the statement, admitting that a woman had found the song "ridiculous" to her.
"I think this is a wise idea.
I have a few more for my parents.
It definitely made me feel like I was.
The prophecy was a little crazy, but I took its essence.
It's a brilliant invention," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny statement, aimed at mothers who pump (often in their offices or toilets) and feel like cows."
This is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are dancing with the amazing pumps in their bra.
The idea behind this idea is that a lot of people think of themselves as feminists.
The LV pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes inside a nursing bra and not properly fit, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even the opportunity to go out while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin, commented: "The LV pump is such a revolutionary product that it has made bold and provocative propaganda.
Entertaining and relatively demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings by drawing a parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, we want to keep breast pumping and all of its challenges in mind.
This is not the first time that the LV pump has come under the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, Cat was seen walking for designer Martha Zukabowski while using her product, despite being the mother of the two.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly evacuated to a tent camp on the border with Texas
While monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children taken into custody has increased as the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants, so they tried to stay in the country by taking children and creating some sort of disturbance.
The risk was further heightened in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and share data with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that dozens of people who had applied to be sponsored by the company, along with minors, had been arrested.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members are here illegally in the country, and a majority of them are foreigners with a criminal history."
"We're going to continue to do that," Mr. Anderson said.
Seeking to process the process with regard to children more quickly, the authorities introduced new regulations, which are the last standard for shelter workers, to take place sooner rather than later than 60 days.
Many appear to an immigration judge to plead their case for legal status, rather than in person, through a video conference call.
Those who are not worthy of relief, we will sensibly expel.
According to reports emanating from the system in recent months, if children are in custody for long periods of time, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said those concerns had been raised in a large facility such as Tornillo, where it was thought it would be difficult to identify the troubled child due to its massive size.
It's a compound trauma that many people are already having to deal with by moving children to Tent City, not giving them enough time to mentally prepare, or saying good-bye to friends.
Syria tells U.S. to immediately withdraw French and Turkish "aggressive forces"
It has been eight years since the start of the war, but Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has called on Syrian refugees to return home.
Maupalem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were under the guise of illegal, fighting terrorism on the soil of Syria, and "we will take action against them."
"They should be withdrawn immediately and there should be no conditions," he said.
Maulem stressed that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, leaving millions more displaced.
He said he would continue this holy struggle until Damascus, the "terror groups", was purged of "illegal foreign presence" and all Syrian territory.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and training both Syrian Arabs and Arabs.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Maulem said that conditions were good for their return, and that "some Western countries" had "spread irrational fears," which prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return," he said.
"They're trying to solve the problem of humanity."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major, Rebel Strog, has provided an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement stopped a massive-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, which is home to three million people.
He stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines," and expressed hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that it would be "dissolved" along with it.
UN Ambassador Stafan de Misura expressed the hope that the first meetings of a new committee, composed of government and opposition members, would soon be convened to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mounipalem conditioned the Syrian government's participation in the committee, warning that the panel's work would limit its "review of the articles of the current constitution" and not interfere.
Why do you think Trump won the second round?
According to that logic, if Mr. Trump doesn't win re-election in 2020, many liberal audiences are hopeful, aspirational, and think the unmature presidency scandal is about to end.

Money out of pocket in mid-term elections
It's no surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th cash flood, thanks to the redesign of congressional districts that landed two incumbents in power in one race for the same seat.
This recently reconstituted suburban Pittsburgh district ditches the Democratic Republic of the Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is heavily overshadowed by the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts should be constitutionally administered in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th race saw the start of a campaign finance slugfest between the main party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after seeing widespread coverage of the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat was held by the Republican for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
The Democrats gave a little bit of edge to the Democrats.
El Salvador was fined for supporting the U.S. and later pulled back because of its support of China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, and there was not much help from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a heart-to-heart meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump company's management team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that U.S. officials had decided to call American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore."
But the fines were considered only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed fines, cuts to financial aid, and targeting visa restrictions were painful for the Central American nation and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead and effectively end the imposition of fines on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the gathering in mid-October, in a sign of importing the administration's sites for the meeting, diplomats said.
Also, the three American ambassadors quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments.
The spokesman declined to comment on the claims made by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal ideas on the anonymity clause.
Their accounts were verified by an outside analyst close to the administration, and the anonymity clause was also talked about.
History of the study
With so much substantial evidence now in the public record, Special Counsel Robert Mueller could stop taking action later on the top of the Trump potential legal obstacle.
Mueller's investigation also revealed that Trump's campaign was involved in a Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will find that in that body he, too, has gone back to the voters and is finally ready to be in charge of his fellow justices.
That said, for the most part, though, and I'm not referring to Trump's loss - or his equivalent in Europe.
We all have choices on both sides of the Atlantic to make that affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, when the West blocked him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, the German authorities were prepared to use military force against Hitler to defeat him.
We've lost a lot of ground and we've lost a lot of ground over the years.
The path of history revolves around such drastic changes, and democracy's unpredictable march will either be accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is facing many of these challenges.
What would we do if Trump got angry at Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, who controls Mueller's investigation?
Last year, since the magazine reported that Rosenstein was secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' argument is not accurate.
"How would he react if the newly sought FBI search on Brett Kavanaugh was not wholly or impartial - or if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite having sexual assault and fraud?
And, above all, are we going to put the Congress in the middle of the doldrums for which Trump is responsible?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will be in danger.
But because of what I have learned in Prague, I believe that we will not fail.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was expelled from the country to Austria during the same Nazi regime.
She lived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika's table.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers team, who had expressed hope before the match against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers are set to host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, a victory over the Austrians after a stunning draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month puts them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorans was prevented from playing for the first time of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he expressed confidence that the Rangers would use the result as a springboard and reach greater heights.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old Graham.
"We went into the game to do something and scored a point.
We may be losing opportunities in the end, but on the whole, perhaps the draw is a good result.
We played well in the first half, but we played well in the second half.
Thursday's game is another big one.
"We're hoping we can score three points, but it's a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm confident that we can go ahead and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, but there is reason to feel good about the position while there have been changes in my injuries and club.
The team is good and the players enjoy it very much; the training is good.
I hope that we can move forward and achieve the success that we had last season."
Women aren't allowed to sleep on the floor
While the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, some people were talking about it with their family.
Half of the people surveyed in the nationwide study were talking to their spouse about long-term care.
Only 10 per cent of the respondents spoke about it in their children.
"People think they have to be protected by a family member, but they're not taking steps to speak out," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the national-level life insurance business.
Heres where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You may not be prepared to provide for your family care if your wishes are not communicated in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be a separate factor in determining the cost.
Take your financial advisor's advice: Your advisor can help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
To help cover these costs in your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-worth life insurance policy, or self-insurance with your own health - as long as you have the money.
Come to a decision with your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in advance.
Take a health-care policy so that you can hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals will implement your ambitions in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your financial needs.
You can choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you don't have the ability.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that one of your parents had a medical emergency at an early age and was on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write them down in a plan to be prepared.
“Financial matters are not only necessary, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

A man in Ilfracombe was shot multiple times with an air rifle
A man returning home from work was shot multiple times with an air rifle.
The victim, who was in his 40s in the Ilfracombe area, was in Devon Oxford Grove when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Describing the manner in which the shooting took place, the officials, which took place at around 02:30 BST, described it as an "incidental act."
The victim did not see any of the assailants attacking him.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police asked for help for evidence.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when the Indonesian city of Palu was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the official said, adding that the death toll could rise.
Due to communication delays, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongga Regency, which measured 7.5 on the earthquake's magnitude, near the epicentre in the north of Pul.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about milk and rags on the island of Sulawesi:
Central Sulawesi is located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, in the Sanni Strait, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
Today marks the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
A regency of the Donggals stretched over 300 km (180 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency and Province Kna Low Administrative Area had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the central Sulawesi region, especially the coastal region of Dongga, is mainly fishing and agriculture.
Nickel and mining are also important in the area, but for the most part, Sulawesi is mostly on the other side of the coast.
Indonesia has been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to a disaster management agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the Dongos.
In 1996, nine people were killed by the tsunami in the west.
Indonesia is known as the Pacific Ring of Fire and has been hit by earthquakes on a regular basis.
Major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are as follows:
On December 26, 2004, a tsunami struck 14 countries off the west coast of northern Sumatra Indonesia's Aceh region, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, many of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 - Java, Indonesia's most populous island, is hit by a 6.8 magnitude tsunami that devastated the southern coast of Indonesia, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 strikes one of the Mentawai Islands along Sumatra, damaging up to 10 meters and destroying dozens of villages and killing over 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Paediatric Jaya Regency in Aceh, severely damaged by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and left people in fear.
No tsunami was reported at the time, but more than 100 people were killed in the buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes strike the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them made their way north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and interference with the domestic violence report, the Alaska State Troopers said in a report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to make a call to report the alleged crimes, he snatched the phone from her.
The KTU reported that Palin was on remand at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was held on a $500 unsecured bond guarantee.
He appeared in court on Saturday where when his pleader asked, he was declared "not guilty," the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misconduct, sentenced to one day in jail and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault allegation.
The case is now before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
Under domestic violence in January 2016, he was convicted of interfering with the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her friends accused her of punching him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by the Veterans Group for her son's violent behavior that stemmed from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia has killed hundreds of people.
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake resulted in a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been damaged.The death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the Indonesian capital, Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake have gone viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people came to the beach festival in the city of Pal.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terror attack.
New York prosecutors have been seeking an unexecuted rare death sentence in the state for federal crime since 1953 for Saifullo Soipov, who is suspected of causing the death of eight people in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Soipov, 30, illegally used a Home Depot rental truck to drive through the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, toward pedestrians, and to carry out an attack on a bike path that would put a cyclist down on his route.
According to the notice, filed in the Southern District of New York to do justice to the death penalty, Saipov must prove that he "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court deed, both of those counts could potentially result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged 22-counts with eight counts of murder in support of racketeering, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in an organized crime and in the prosecution of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack was "adequate planning and forethought," describing the manner in which Saipov handled it as "the most brutal, brutal and immoral."
"Saifullo Bahebullevic Saipov and Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Un-Lare Decadit, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlize, Hernan Ferruzzi, Herman Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damin Punguco have caused damage to the families and friends," the statement states.
Five of the victims were tourists.
It has been a decade since the death penalty was imposed in New York City.
The defender and Khalid Barnes were convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but were eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, two Rosenbergs were executed in electric chair executions.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, behaved unrepentantly for days and months after the attack according to the court deed.
Police say they believe he did the right thing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was motivated for the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he did not want the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He did not agree to the 22-count conviction.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "certainly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that seeking a death sentence because of the possibility of a conviction being a life in prison and not being able to be released increases the agony of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death warrant.
Nigel Farage should be held accountable for Brexit allegations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage pledged today to form an army of the people during a protest at the Tory compound.
Former EU leaders said politicians felt the heat from Euroseptics and suggested that Theresa May, one of her own MPs, should be held accountable in EU negotiations.
"""If Conservative backbencher Peter Bonn was Brexit secretary at Birmingham, the UK would be out by now,"" he said."
The challenge is deeply divided in addressing the challenge that Mrs. May faces by taking part in a special protest against Brexit in the city that has been marked by pro-Remain Tories.
The premiere fights to keep the checkers on track in a compromise plan between Brexiters, retainers and attacks from the EU.
The Allies insisted on a deal with Brussels - and Euroseptics and Labour forced her to choose between the package and the cayos.
"He said he wanted ""chuck checkers"" at a Bon Leave Means Leave rally in Solihill."
It was suggested that the fare be examined with Brussels and made responsible for negotiations.
If I had been accused, I would have been out by now, he said.
Wellingborough MP said: I will stand for Brexit but we have to throw the chuckers.'
In his opposition in the EU, he said: We are not fighting world wars.
We wanted to make our own laws in our own country.'
Since the 2016 vote, Mr Bonn has overturned public opinion advice: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>It is their idea that the British people have changed their minds and that it is absolutely false to exist.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also present at the march and told reporters: I say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Checkers are not popular with the general public, the opposition is going to vote for it, that is with our party and activists on the streets without actually popularising them and electing us in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message to Macy, she said: When the Prime Minister fulfills his promises, he will keep his position.
If they betray the decisions made by the politicians in the 2016 Referendum, they should feel the heat, Farage said.
This is a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class, he said.
"""They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them, 'We're not going to let you go without you doing it.'"""
In an enthusiastic crowd, he said: I think our political class that wants to harm Brexit should feel the heat.
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>We encourage the public army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, a self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
In the meantime, the Mariners marched through Birmingham before running a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists after the group's unveiling this weekend blew the tories away against the Brexit banners.
The Labour Lord Adonis Conservatives were mocked for their security concerns with a party app at the start of the conclave.
"""All of the technology for these people and Canada Plus, who are with us that they can get the IT systems they want, is for a frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland,"" he said."
"""It's totally a hoax."
"There's nothing like a good book," he said.
Warren, who is running for president, has a tough look
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she had "seriously watched the presidential race" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday in a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren was a frequent critic of President Donald Trump and was co-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts Campaign for Re-election against GOP State Rep. Jeff DeHill.
She is looking forward to competing in 2020.
It was her 36th meeting with voters using the town hall since the incident on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke came to power.
One of the participants asked if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied: "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government that's improper and put a woman in the top position."
arrested for the murder of Mr. Simmons
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, have announced the arrest of a suspect Saturday in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dayton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m.
They released a video on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in a footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University on Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
He was stopped by his friend and killed by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to possessing a weapon and firing Sims while in custody.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-inch-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season and had 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After his victory over Sebastian Vettel, Team Lewis Hamilton is close to a world title
Since Valtteri Bottas' qualification on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes will play a bigger role in the Team Orders race than Lewis Hamilton.
Bothas had a good start from the pole and almost soiled Hamilton to defend his place in the first two rounds and invited Wettel to attack his teammate.
Wettel first went to the pits and rushed to the traffic in the pack tail, hoping that something might be certain.
Mercedes then pitted in a lap and came back behind Wettel, but Hamilton saw a reluctant Ferrari driver within a risk after a double move to defend the third corner after a two-wheel-to-wheel action.
Max Verstappen started from the grid's Backrow and finished seventh in the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then stayed on top of his tyres for the Quick Finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place to make it to the big part of the race.
As a result, he reached the Pitts in lap 44, but Raikkonen finished fourth after failing to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri has done a fantastic job over the weekend and has been a real person to my side.
"The team did a great job," Hamilton said.
It's actually a bad sign.
US President Donald Trump accused senior Senator Diana Feinstein of sexually assaulting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a rally on Saturday after she insisted that the letter from Christine Blasey Ford had not been leaked.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee did not directly address the president, but instead commented that the people were "low, bad and lying" about what was going on in the Senate.
"The thing that can happen and the nicest thing is to go to the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people getting angry, and less and less and more bad and lying," he said.
"When you look at the releases and the leaks, they say, 'Oh, that's not what I do.'
I did not do it."
Do you remember?
Daisy, did you get it?
Remember her answer... you leaked the documentary - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't close."
Okay, wait a minute.
We leaked, we didn't, we didn't leak," he said.
Last July, a letter was sent to Finstein detailing the allegations against Cavanaugh by Ford and it was leaked last September - but Finstein has denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide the allegations from Dr. Ford, I didn't leak her story," he told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked."
But her refusal to attend a meeting with the president was commented on Saturday night during the rally: "I'll tell you what it is, really it's bad body language.
She may not be, but I've never seen anything like it."
Continuing his defense in the Supreme Court, the president pointed out that those accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and that the Democrats were using the charges for their own indiscretions.
"They are determined to come back to power.
"When you were young, you saw it as bad, you didn't care who they were hurting, they didn't care who they had to knock down to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants
Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3 in their return fixture on Saturday in the I-League.
The Giants had the lead of Rondu's goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the host team before Dwyer saved the Giants' lead.
Two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen equalled Francois Bouchard Dundee before scoring their winning goals.
Adam Keefe's men's team lost 2-1 to Dundy on Friday night.
This is the fourth time the Giants have won in the last three games of the season.
Dwyer's first goal came in the 3:35 minute with the help of Quadl McFall, with David Rutherford taking the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan led the hosts in the 13:10 minute, when initially in trouble, and then equalized in the 15:16 minute with Matt Markardett.
At the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night and ensured that Dwyer took the lead for the Giants.
The host team bounced back and Bouchard again tied the powerplay goal in the 27:37 minute.
Crowne and Charles Cochrane helped Nisel take the lead for the first time in the second half of the match for Dundee and ensured that his team won in the final half of the fifth.

Hundreds of people were evacuated from the plane by air traffic controllers.
The air traffic controller was praised after a plane carrying hundreds of people in Indonesia died while ensuring a safe landing.
More than 800 people died and the island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami on Friday.
Strong subsequent outbreaks continued in the area and many of the city's ruins were trapped.
But while his colleagues were fighting for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his job and left the control tower madly at the Mutiyara sis Al Zufri Airport Pali Airport.
The crew of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was determined to take off safely.
He said that the traffic control tower was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
"The decision could have saved hundreds of lives," said Hohnnes Siroith, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, according to ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balak Papan, Kalimantan, to another big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before the helicopter reached the pole.
He said, "We're going to listen to it."
In the meantime, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands. the country's disaster prevention agency says it has restricted access to the towns of thieves, Sigi and Boutang.
"There are still many bodies under the rubble and we believe we need to reach more people who can still rise," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A mass burial will take place on Sunday after the city is covered by a six-metre-tall wave of milk.
Military and commercial flights are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
All the markets have been shut down."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is going ahead to provide help to the survivors but we don't know what they will find here.
It could be worse, but it could be worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodobo arrived in the city of Pal on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night in connection with the lighting work.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
More than 550 people were killed in the Lombok earthquake earlier this year.
Air Niugini says man missing after Lagoon plane crashes in Micronesia
The plane, operated by an airline in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, crashed after 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, the male passenger had not been able to find one.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately provide further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew during the landing at Chuck Island Airport.
On Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were in the hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events that took place are not clear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the runway.
There was some evidence that the water was leaking.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane was at a very low altitude.
"That's a good thing," Jane said.
Jenus said he and others had tried to walk hard since the emergency on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants shouted in concern and he received minor injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were building the dock before the plane sank nearly 30 meters (100 feet) into the water had also used a wind blow boat to help get them ashore.
According to data from the aviation safety network, PNG-registered airlines have killed 111 people in the last two decades but Air New Zealand has indicated that no one has died.
"Night Oman was burnt alive,"" the analyst said"
On Saturday, the prosecution in its case again rested a man accused of killing a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulett testified for a few hours as an expert in the intelligence analysis department.
The 29-year-old Quinton Tellies and the victim, Jessica Chambers, told the court how he used cell phone records to break them into pieces the night of the death.
Rowlett said she was with Tellis Chambers on the evening of her death and that he had received a lot of location data from a cell phone contrary to his past claim.
During his time in the cell phone chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanfrad, who had sent police to talk to Sanfrad.
Mr. Brown testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, he said that Sanfrad was in the truck that night, and that Sanfrad "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
The only difference is that she had been dead for about two weeks.
The couple's cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
For a period after Chambers' death, Tellleys removed the Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of his life," he said.
On Sunday, they were scheduled to begin their final arguments.
The judge said the case would go to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is Active Hip Hop?
The pop-hop trio wanted to challenge the negative opinion on the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
From Bristol, The Hybrid hip hop says it is moving away from the roots of its political messages and solving political problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate hip-hop.
The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence recently in the UK through people like Akala and Lukey.
Another black man?!
N.Y. Nani's wife filed a case against him for 'racist' remark
The New York Nanny sued the couple for setting them on fire indiscriminately after receiving a false text from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denied that they were racist, calling the case like a "robbery."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, and a new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, were outraged when she found out she was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"Don't be another black man," Flaxo-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice twice.
The New York Post reported that Plaxo-Flaxman, who was leaving "inconveniently" after she realized her mistake, set fire to Miss Maurice, saying she had done something bad to the African-American and hoped for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home for Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation for Faring and has sued the couple to live on $350 a day for six months, initially to do so, without a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you don't do things like that," she said in a Friday post, adding, "I know it's discretionary."
The couple also said that it was helpful to have Maurice fired from his job because they were racists and that they were afraid of hurting her.
"My wife sent me something she couldn't tell me.
She is not racist.
"We're not racist people," her husband told the Post.
Do you have a child in your life who is grieving?
Your new-born child?
Tell me."
The case is a "robbery," as if his wife was only two months into the birth of the child, and was "in a very difficult situation," Plasco said.
"You're going with someone like that?"
That's not a good thing," the banker said.
As legal cases continued to move forward, the plebiscite court was quick to attack the couple on their behavior and logic on social media.
Paddington Publishers fears readers won't be able to form a relationship to cope with what the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to let anyone read it before it was published.
I'm very happy to hear that Pattinson has been a great success."
Talking about her father as a BBC cameraman who was inspired to write a children's book by little Toy Bear, she said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "poor."
"Paddington is a very important person in our family," she said, describing her father as "very proud of his upcoming success."
"He's not a very nice person," she said.
"But if you have a child who achieves something, the aura is almost the same: you can be proud of them even if you don't.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he was always the only one who valued Pondington."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye on the phone
Upon arrival, her daughter was taken to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her.
"Nod has been calling regularly that it's too bad, and she's hoping to do that," said Mrs. Ednan-Leparous.
"Then I got a call from Nad. She told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted her to take a vacation.
I said it.
I said, "I love you, dear.
I will come to you soon.
I will come to you.
Medications given to her by the doctors to pump the heart have slowed down and she has left the system.
She had died and it was all over.
I know it's all going to end, so I'll just have to wait and see.
I couldn't cry or scream loudly or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really need to put it all together."
As a result of losing her daughter, Mrs. Edn<0xC3><0xA1>n-Leop<0xC3><0xA1>rous, boarded the plane with the other passengers - forgetting about the ordeal she was going through.
"I don't know who," she said.
"I tilt my head and all that time my eyes were watering.
It's hard to describe, but I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nod on the flight.
He wants my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Women's self-portraits to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from losing their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were posting cards on top of the Welsh Bridge with phone numbers for people to call for inspiration and support.
Miss Davis' son Tyler committed suicide at the age of 13 and 18 when he was suffering from depression.
"I don't want my kids to have to think about me every day," she said.
Miss Davis, age 45, lives in Lidney, a well where her son, Infectious laughter, said.
Everyone knows about his smile.
They will never see the light of day."
Before he died, however, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place."
Taylor's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, committed suicide in 2014.
Miss Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that the pain may flare up again."
Miss Davis made the cards, saying, "Don't let people know you have people there for you, whether you're a friend or not."
You need to sit down and talk."
Miss Humphreys, years-old Miss Davies' girlfriend, lost her 15-year-old partner, Markuni, soon after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was upset or depressed or feeling anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, when he opened his presents for the children, he was stupefied to see them or anything.
He said that his death had caused them major injury, but she said that they should work on it: "It would create a rift in the family.
It disturbs us.
We all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"If we can grow something like what he's asking for - in a time of research, in a time of limited ambition - we can bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" and that he was stuck in the middle of a partisan girdlock.
Why did Mr. Kuvanou and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their wills are always in place.
The midterm elections are just four weeks away - on November 6 - and if the Republicans do as badly as expected, their efforts to get the person they want to elect to the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush took the phone to call all of the senators, a man who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him to support his ex-wife Ashley, Mr. Bush's personal secretary, Mr. Kavanaugh.
What happens after the F.B.I. submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to garner at least 50 votes in the Senate floor, which could enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to veto the deal and certify it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors fall under Kim's watch
North Korean defectors fell to South Korea after Kim Jung-un came to power seven years earlier, the South's lamer said.
Park Beiyang-seung, a unifying minister from the south, said there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
There are strict border controls between North Korea and China and high rate of charge by individuals smugglers have been key factors.
The Pyongyang government did nothing.
Most of the North Korean defectors were granted North Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, because of the long border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as Akram immigrants and forcibly repatriates them to their own countries.
Relations between North and South - technically still at war - have improved a lot in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss a centre-stage nuclear disarmament talks.
It was after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to a broader set of conditions for working towards a nuclear-free Korean territory.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there is no trust in our national security and, under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will be unilaterally disarmed first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
"Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh ""historical"" and said he was incapable of serving the Supreme Court"
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi met with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanau "hysterical" and said he was uniquely qualified to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"If a woman ever chose that path, I couldn't help it," Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh became almost overwhelmed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, which was run by angry liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, saying his above-mentioned illnesses were "discreet and uncoordinated behavior that would kill."
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that Ama could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased toward Democrats.
"I think he should be disqualifying himself for the way he went with those ads and behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Cavanaugh if he confirmed, and whether the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"I would say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just going to fit into the Supreme Court, he's not going to the court he's in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she considered the Afrodible Care Act, or Rovi, as a conservative judge, potential Kanawano rulings against Wade.
In his confirmation rulings, Savonau was asked if he could change specific Supreme Court rulings..
"This is not the time to go to court for the sake of historicity, because of the partisan nature of it, and we're not going to say 'it's not pretty'," Pelosi said.
Women have to go with it.
It was a reproach in a righteous word, months and years of indignation, all of it was torn away, and she could not get it out without crying.
"We get angry when we get angry," Ms. Steenem said to me after 45 years.
"I thought it wasn't that unusual, you think?"
She continued, "Getting help through a woman who works somewhere as an executive, she cries when she gets angry, but when angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, "You can think I'm sad so I'm crying."
I am furious."
And she says so.
I thought it was wonderful."
Watering of the eyes is allowed as part of the course of aggression, so they are primarily understood.
From my fast-forward memories from the previous job, in a male-dominated office, when I was crying to myself with indescribable anger, an older woman - a calmer manager - who I've always been somewhat fearful of with her - grabbed my Scorpio and dragged it into a stairwell.
She said, "You'll never see me."
They don't know you're angry.
They thought you were sad and would be happy when they came to you."
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential terms.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in a boat called Monkey Business and in an extravagant relationship and pulled out of the race, Miss Schroeder, too embarrassed, realized she had no reason to go for the presidency.
"That's not something that's been well thought out and decided," he said, laughing with me after 30 years.
"There were already seven others in the race, and they wanted one last.
Someone said it was "Sasno White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was delayed, she withdrew funding and promised not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It's a losing war.
Her supporters found that she was paid only $250 for the men who gave her $1,000.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she thought.
She announced that she would not launch an official campaign, overcome by so much emotion - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that was so hard to raise money on, and anger at the system that it was more difficult to target voters than to delegate, and anger at sexism - which made it more difficult for her.
"You may think that I have mental depression," recalled Ms. Schkoder, about what the press had responded to her.
"I thought you were my business partner."
Do you know what they say about my tattoo?
"Is she crying?"""
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing
Trade between the U.S. and China could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts said, without listening to a sequence of early events, getting out of the war, and keeping the differences between the countries at bay.
Donald Trump, the US president, sent the first warning to Chinese experts earlier this year by imposing taxes, including on solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The very special increments this week have impacted $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods and nearly half of the tax on all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has, at every item's discretion, recently increased tariffs by five to ten percent on more than $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to blow up the U.S., and the world's two largest economies may not bounce back anytime soon.
Bringing Washington back means bowing to demands, but bowing to propaganda to the U.S. could be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the U.S. trade war pressure could favorably support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies over a period of time.
"A quick fix in Washington or Beijing's poisoning economy is even more dangerous than any country has ever accepted onlookers," said Abigail Grace, head of the Center for New American Security and Research Associate for Asia at the think tank.
"Syria is ""ready"" for the return of refugees," the foreign minister said"
Syria has said it is ready to accept refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid-al-Mou Alim said the situation in the country was improving.
"Thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism, the field is more stable and secure today," he said.
The government is continuing to restore normalcy in the region.
There are all conditions for the return of the country's refugees as a result of terrorism, unilateral negotiations that have been aimed at leaving them and their lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'mun said the Syrian regime could help rebuild the devastated country.
He said that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
The Europeans won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe Le Golf won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA 16.5 to 10.5 in Paris, France.
Now the U.S. has lost six consecutive times in European territory and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
The Danish captain, Thomas Björn, scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had fought most of the tournament, shot a tee shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole and gave the game to Francesco Molina.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players in the current format starting in 1979 with a 5-0-0 score.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest-ranked player in the European team, lost to Denmark's Thor Björn Olesen of 5&4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ayana Poulter, who may have played his final rider's cup.
Spaniard Sergo Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's all-time youngest European with 25.5 career points.
I'm currently 7 and I can't wait.
It has been almost a year.
Thank you for believing in me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have won again.
It's about the team and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia, who is emotional after the European victory, said.
He presented Kagdani to his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated U.S. goal legend Tiger Woods in singles 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"It's an incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, and I've grown to watch him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost his four games in France and now his rider's cup record is 13-21-3.
Jack Nicholson is the second-highest-ranked player in the history of Time, having won 14 major titles.
Team USA struggled to find good ways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fina, all of whom played Adika Shakti golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team was let down, "For what they fought for, I'm proud of them.
Today we took a trip to Europe.
We're totally off.
Get out of here, Thomas.
He's a great captain.
He played 12 games very well.
We will regroup and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward."
I am very proud to be a captain and to be one of them.
You've got to take your spot.
We played well."
Red Tied Update: Reduced Densities in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission showed a general decrease in red tide density in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, pachyderm bloom conditions - in areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Toliar counties - are indicative of a decreased concentration.
The Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles north of Pinellas and Southern Lee to the coastal region of the counties.
Patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County but at a few sites earlier than last week.
The red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
The median density or Hillsboro coast has been low-to-high densities over the past week, high densities from the background in Manati County, high densities from the background on the coast of Sarasota County, high densities from the background on the coast of Lee County, and low densities in Collier County.
Respiratory fires continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
There have been no reported cases of respiratory inflammation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
