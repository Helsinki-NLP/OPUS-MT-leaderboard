Rapidly increasing incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The progressive phenomenon related to the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has ensured that the COVID-19 pandemic, with different stages depending on each country, is progressing rapidly in all countries, by showing the same pattern in the EU/EU/EEA and the UK.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units must ramp up their preparedness to ramp up the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, information on how many people were infected with pneumonia without known causation was recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the agent responsible for the outbreak was a new type of coronavirus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Hence, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).
As per the evidence available till date, about 80% of COVID-19 infected individuals have moderate or non-communicable respiratory tract infections, i.e., Pneumonia and most of these recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes an additional serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital is around 4%.
In this study, we compared the trends in COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and compared them with that of China's Hubei province.
We have compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Following China, COVID-19 has spread further geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is a reflection of the current situation in the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spyderi and others documented Europe's first confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first three confirmed cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) were from Wuhan, Hubei province in China, who returned to France on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. As of 31 December 2019, there have been 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, including 17,750 in Italy alone.
Subsequent numbers and subsequent events related to COVID-19 cases are being received.
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official data on the reported number of COVID-19 cases received from each country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization are updated daily at 8 am.
The data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with the trend in Italy.
In response to the current COVID-19 cases in the local area, we calculated the 14-day rapid cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
As on 15th March 2020 at 8.00 am, we have also provided a tiered count of cases from each country as compared to Italy for the period 31st January to 15th March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The trend of 14-day rapid cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (China) followed the trend in Hubei Province (Fig. 1).
The gradual process of increasing the spread of COVID-19 to the entire EU/EU/EEA and the United Kingdom began on February 21st, and has since accelerated on February 28th, 2020 (subsidiary).
This is largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown similar increasing trends in subsequent cases of COVID-19 (substance).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases available compared to the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom during the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on March 15, relatively, the number of cases in Italy had already been recorded by 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, on or before just 3 weeks in advance.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Looking at the overall trend of COVID-19 related cases, it seems that the pandemic is progressing relatively fast in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and the national public health response is different in different countries with different definitions of the disease and different procedures including rapid testing to select patients for testing to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in the affected areas had reached their peak capacity.
Data on COVID-19 cases admitted to the hospital and/or intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EU level of 6% and 1% each (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and deaths recorded.
A 2010<0xE2><0x80><0x93>11 study showed a high difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate beds in Europe, with a prevalence of 29.2 per 100,000 people in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
In the context of health care capacity-concentration models, the ECDC Rapid Crisis Assessment for COVID-19 for each of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, which has been assessed as having a risk of more than 90% over the number of beds in intensive care units, has been updated for the sixth time.
So far, the EU/EEA countries and certain parts of the UK have been designated as disease groups, and since hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the region's population, a cross-sectional naming system for both cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the 2 (Nuts-2) monastery.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly accelerating in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must thus prepare themselves for the sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases requiring health care, especially intensive care, in the affected regions of Italy.
In addition to changing the mitigation approach as mentioned in the latest ECDC Quick Risk Assessment, a proactive and all-encompassing approach is required to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and if it is not implemented in an early manner, the expected rapid increase in the number of infections will not take enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond to the situation.
Rapid risk assessment lists the impact of the pandemic and public health measures.
There is a small window of opportunity, which countries have the potential to use to further ramp up containment efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the crisis in the healthcare sector.
Failing to do so could lead to a massive rise in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks, with health care providers in the EU/EEA regions likely to face a sharp increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world, infecting 80,000 and resulting in a devastating end to life for humans.
SARS-CoV-2 may have spread from bats, similar to SARS-CoV, which caused SARS-CoV to thousands of people in 2003, a virus of the same type, and may develop similar symptoms in the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older adults and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will look at the basics of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help us understand and eradicate the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020, is an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday season and for several weeks after, due to the spread of the new virus.
The characteristics of the virus are similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was named COVID-19-
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
As on 2 March 2020, the virus has spread and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases has reached 80,000, of which 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is the ""first common enemy"" and said it is more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report that determined the sequence of viral infections from various patients was released on 7th January 2020, more than 200 papers related to virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 have been published.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research on new and rapidly advancing research materials.
Whenever possible, we try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-derived diseases and Middle Eastern Swine Syndrome (2012 outbreak).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about disease avoidance and predictability, as well as the remaining urgent questions.
Since approximately 15% of the common cold causes 4 common colds, coronaviruses have traditionally been thought of as disease-causing organisms that do not cause death to humans.
However, in this century, we have twice faced the highly pathogenic human cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began to spread at an early stage in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and have caused severe disease outbreaks and deaths in many other countries.
COVID-19 is the third confirmed case of the virus in the history of humanity.
On 31 December 2019, the National Health Commission of China was first informed from Wuhan of the outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin, as shown in Figure 1.1.
Seven days later, the sequence of COVID was released.
The first death was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and other countries.
On January 20, reports of infection among healthcare providers revealed that it was possible to transmit the disease from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was completely shut down and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 41 infected patients, only 21 had time contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site where the outbreak began from an unconfirmed animal.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
By the time the report was released, the disease had already spread to nearly 50 countries in China and the world (Fig. 2).
As the environment is rapidly changing, the final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
In a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11th February 2020, more information on the pandemic has been released as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but the primary victims are people in the age group of 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected individuals are above 50 years of age and very few are below 20 years of age. Further, only 14 of the infected individuals are below 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more common in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread primarily through mass gatherings in and around Hubei.
It took an average of 5 (2-9) days to diagnose since the onset of COVID-19.
The average duration of onset of symptoms is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8 - 13) days.
The base reproduction number (R.0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
In China, the number of people infected before January 23, 2020, was rapidly increasing, matching the large traffic before the Spring Festival.
The Case Fatality Rate amongst the confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the Modified Case Fatality Rate among all the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (60 and above) and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses belong to a subfamily of the large and enveloped virus of the single strand RNA (RNA).
They can be divided into four species, namely Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, in which alpha- and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
The encapsulation spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptors angiotensin-transferable enzyme 2 (ACE2) and typeptidel peptides 4 (DBP4), respectively, for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In the virus, the RNA genome is released into the nucleus; after the virus genome is replicated, the enveloped glycoprotein and protein-containing microorganisms are joined to the viral genome by a mutated RNA virus.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-KV-2 was recorded on 10th January 2020.
A new type of beta-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetic identification, was found between 10 sequencing samples collected at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the original place where the outbreak began.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically identical to SARS-CoV, rather than MERS-CoV. It is also known as SARS-CoV-2.
With the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the upper extremity of the human airway esophagus.
Both human ACE2, SARS-KV-2 and SARS-KV have been found to be receptors.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE-2, which is weaker than SARS-CoV-2, coincidentally with the fact that it causes less severe infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients than SARS-CoV-2.
Modern small protein coded by ORF3B and secretion protein coded by ORF8 can also be produced by SARS-CoV-2.
ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the pathogenic ability and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, ORF8 does not have a known functional mass or orientation.
On February 18, 2020, Zoe and others recorded a full-length low-temperature electronic microscope configuration of human ACE2 with the amino acid transducer B0AT1 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85>.
The ACE-2-B0AT1 link will combine the two S proteins that identify and source the ACE2-B0AT1 infection with an opening and closing form.
B0AT1 may be a treatment target for drug surveillance to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Initial and intermediate bearing
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through the mouths of civet cats and camels respectively.
By way of evolutionary comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-CoV-2, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 was initially inhabited by bats, as the SARS-CoV-2 was the same as the SARS-CoV-2, because there are two SARS-CoV-2-like SARS-CoV-2-CoVs (SLV-45.SLV.Z.V.) and SARS-CoV.
However, it is not yet known what caused the virus to spread to humans beyond the racial barrier, and the way in which it spread is unclear.
Ji and others have proposed that the virus may have spread from bats to humans through snakes due to a similar recombination of their S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, the most widely used form of Chinese traditional medicine, the long-shorned ant-eating mammal ants are likely to have borne SARS-CoV-2, because 99% of SARS-CoV-2 viruses found in ants are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference, and we are still waiting for reliable results (Fig. 33).
The physical health of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in an outdoor dry environment, and up to 5 days in an environment with 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have had similar characteristics.
Ultraviolet rays and exposure to 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes have been reported to be resistant to SARS-CoV-2; 75% of ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can cause the virus to become inactivated.
The entire population of humans is immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
At present, there are no detailed studies on the protective effects of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only correct previous studies about other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, if a virus infects an infected person, it is first identified by the immune system through differentially identifying receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, doll-like receptors (DLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR) and RIG-like receptors (RLR).
The virus stimulates the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of the cytoplasm, and the synthesis of the first type of immune protein (IFNs) in different ways that limit the spread of the virus and increase the way the virus is absorbed and destroyed in the blood swabs of the antigens of the virus.
However, my protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the mutating immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in self-defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells trigger B-nuclei to form antibodies against that particular virus. Furthermore, CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
In order to help defend cells, T-helper cells form pro-inflammatory cytony.
However, the coronavirus can cause the thyroid cells to die off on their own, preventing the functioning of the thyroid glands.
Immunity and other antibodies, including C3 and C5, are necessary to fight the virus.
For example, antibodies obtained from recovered patients deactivated MERS-KV.
On the other hand, the immune system releases a large number of endocrine molecules in the area due to excessive activity, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs.
SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect the elderly and pregnant women with both diseases, due to its group initial components.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or people with compromised immune systems to have a higher chance of contracting the disease than others.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the estimated incubation period is 1-14 days, with a minimum incubation period of 3-7 days, based on a study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, in a study of 1,099 people, the average duration of onset of symptoms was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
In a more recent study, based on the population of 8,866 cases described above, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The most important task for health authorities is to change the effective quarantine period based on the duration of the onset of symptoms, so that infected but asymptomatic people can avoid spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals infected or infected with the virus are usually required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Is the self-isolation period to be extended to 24 days?
The main and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no symptoms or with symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, body aches, fainting, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after infection, some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or blood loss.
In severe cases, patients develop hypersensitivity syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and congenital acidosis.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be tested during the initial diagnostic phase, even if they do not have lung disorders.
A population study in late December 2019 showed that 98% of people with fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, 3% diarrhea, and 8% of patients required ventilatory support.
Two recent studies have found similar findings on a family group and an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, a 2012 population study showed that the primary symptoms of MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, in the same way that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19, 80% of them require more ventilator support than COVID-19 patients.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also diagnosed in MERS patients.
The main symptoms of SARS were fever (99%-100), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%).
By 14 February, the global number of confirmed cases stood at 66,576, while the fatality rate for COVID-19 was 2%.
By November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS was 10% of the 8,096 people infected.
For Mersuk, based on a population survey conducted in June 2012, of the 2,494 confirmed cases, the mortality rate was 37%.
Previous studies have shown that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is higher at 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV is in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparison of symptoms, mortality and R.0 between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but lower mortality than the other two.
Thus, the containment of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Gradual outbreaks often occur in the same family or in the same congregation or in vehicles such as a luxury ship.
Patients often have symptoms such as visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas, or coming into contact with individuals or patients who had been infected two weeks before the outbreak began.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and have been discharged from the hospital may be carrying the virus again.
In the early stages, patients may have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (in particular, lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 patients with COVID-19, syphilis with a white blood cell count less than 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including a venous cell count less than 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and high aspartate aminotransplant levels and microbial presence in the blood were detected.
In some patients, the levels of liver and muscle enzymes and cytoplasm in the blood increased, and in most patients, the C-reactive protein and red blood cell count increased.
In patients with severe cases, the D-twice, a blood clot-determining agent, was higher, and the filtration rate was much lower.
In the majority of COVID-19 patients, abnormality in breast irradiation has been detected and there is opaqueness in the lungs, such as double glazed shadows or stained glass.
The patients have occasional abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARTS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive filament proliferation seriously compromise gas exchange.
The activation of type one and type two pneumocytes reduces the spreader level and increases the spreader level, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and maximizing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, poor breast-radiated findings often show the most serious nature of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, in the first diagnostic analysis of COVID-19, pneumocytes dispersal, exogenous formation, and tissue venous venous intrusion into the lungs of a deceased patient.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleotide (RNA) via recombinant transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is being used as an important mandate for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, due to the false-negative rate, which could exacerbate the pandemic, hospital exposures in China on February 13, 2020 used diagnostic methods (not relying solely on RT-PCR) to detect the disease.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
However, information on pre-existing diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are essential and mandatory for proper diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Shang Group described the process of detection of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based technology, using 10 microns per 100 microns per minute (CV-2 to 10 microns per liter) of micronutrients (RNA-18 to 20 <0xC3><0x97> 18 microliters per liter).
It is believed that if the clinical samples are confirmed, the new technology will be able to dramatically improve sensory capacity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with novel COVID-19, doctors primarily provide support care to COVID-19 patients, while seeking out different types of treatments previously used or proposed as a treatment option for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases. (Section 2)
Current and effective treatments include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese drugs, and psychosocial support.
It was also proposed to use plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing rapidly to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may also attack other organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys that release ACE2.
However, shortness of breath or inability to breathe is a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is important to relieve symptoms and protect lives, including general oxygen therapy, oxygen high flow, intrusive ventilation and intrusive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute suffocation syndrome should be supported by a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique called facepalm membrane biosynthesis (Egmo), which is used to treat a heart attack or a life-threatening suffocation.
In addition, maintaining the electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the preservation of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokinesis has been shown to be the result of increased immune function in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of grouped inflammatory dwarfism that releases an array of cytokines including TNF alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFN coma and MCP-1.
These enzymes stimulate the immune cells to release a large number of non-financial molecules, which are the main cause of ARTS and various organ dysfunctions.
Immunization suppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine stroms, especially in severe patients.
Tacilzumab, an anti-IL6 anti-cellulite antibody, has been used to treat cytokine storm.
Modifying T-cell-activated immune response; inhibition of IFN-coma, IL-1 and DNA; JAK suppression, plenumomab; suppression of cytokine signal 4 for post-traumatic stress syndrome; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective in severe lung injury among SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In turn, they can cause serious side effects, especially skeletal tissue damage without blood flow, and have a large impact on prognosis.
However, it is recommended that patients at risk of life-threatening COVID-19 should be provided with palliative care for a short-term, at least first-to-middle-of-the-middle level of prudence.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous intravenous infusion of the nucleic acid source remdesivir has been found to have the desired effect on a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new type of drug that destroys the virus initially created by Clyde to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlboroviruses.
Later, even Remdesivir, along with other single-fiber ribonucleotides (RNA - RNA), including MERS and SARS viruses, demonstrated the ability to suppress pathogens.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with the joint material for conducting trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, whose results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinpi, interveron-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Following treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other unwanted effects may occur.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs given to patients should also be carefully monitored.
Plasma and other antigens from recovered patients.
Individuals who collect the blood of patients who have recovered from an infectious disease and treat other patients with the same disease or are otherwise healthy have a long history of protection against the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered have higher levels of antibodies in their blood compared to the pathogens.
Antibodies are antibodies made by B-vitamins to fight pathogens and other foreign organisms. They identify unique molecules in the pathogens and deactivate them directly.
On this basis, plasma of blood collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 was administered to 10 patients who were in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours and the burden of inflammation and virus was reduced and there was improvement in the level of oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, in the absence of any specific treatment modalities being developed, it is necessary to confirm and elucidate on a large scale before proposing the system.
In addition, despite the therapeutic effects, certain disadvantages associated with plasma should also be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response to produce a cytokine releasing syndrome that can become a life - threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the need for plasma is high for treating life-threatening patients.
It is difficult to develop and manufacture enough specific antibodies to rapidly fight an international pandemic.
Thus, the extraction of B-cells from recovered patients, the detection of genetic codes of effective antibodies, or the detection of effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus is all the more necessary and practical.
In this way, we can immediately increase the production of the antigens.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effects depend on the combination of various components of a formula, which may vary depending on the diagnosis based on the principles of DCM.
Most of the beneficial components are unknown or obscure as it is difficult to extract and confirm such components or their Ugamma fusions.
As there is currently no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is the main alternative treatment for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from serious conditions.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Tu capsules and Lian Hua Shing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China reported higher recovery rates, including Kansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hanan (50%), where DCM used to treat 87% of COVID-19 patients, while Hubei province reported the lowest recovery rate (13%), with DCM using only an approximate 30% over COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a more approximate comparison, as more and more impact factors such as the number and severity of patients need to be factored into the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Fake Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) and combined treatment of DCM with that of WM.
They found that the time required for recovery, symptomatic disappearance and hospitalization was lower for the traditional Chinese medicine group with Western medicine than for the group who only took Western medicine.
More mind-bogglingly, the rate of worsening of the syndrome (intensification from target) is significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>DCM group than just the WM group (46.2% versus 7.4%). Also, the mortality rate in the WM<0x2B>DCM group is lower than in the just WM group (3.9% vs. 8%).
However, the efficacy and safety of DCM will have to wait for studies to be conducted on a larger scale and more centres in well-controlled environments.
It is interesting to elaborate on the mechanisms of action and to explain the mechanisms of TCM treatments or, if possible, the beneficial components of their compounds.
Patients who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 often experience a great deal of fear of infections or even death, and isolated people experience tiredness, loneliness, and anger.
Further, the symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of oxygen, cough, etc., and the adverse effects of cardiogenic steroids taken during treatment, such as insomnia, can lead to additional anxiety and distress.
In the early stages of SARS, there were reports of a wide range of mental disorders, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychosis, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health measures in response to the spread of COVID-19, can cause people to feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and the pull against their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people who are suspected to have the disease and those who come in contact with them, and the general public in need.
Psychological support should include mental health groups covering different fields, clear exchanges and treatment plans with continued and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as well as use of professional electronic tools and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Vaccines that are effective in interrupting the chain of transmission from animals to humans and from infected humans are essential and antiviral therapy should also be taken to control the infection caused by emerging pathogens.
Efforts are underway to develop an S protein-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a long-term and inactivated antibody and/or protective immunity.
The vaccine for SARS has been evaluated on animal models that have eliminated live virulence.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines on elderly and dying samples and their safety against animal-derived pathogens remains to be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is because SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and since then there has been no new outbreak of the disease.
In contrast, MERS continues to occur in the Middle East in Anganga and groups, and has spread to other areas because of the presence of animals in the diseased areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated pathogens, DNA plasmids, ultraviolet rays, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and hybrid protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and important task in controlling the current pandemic.
However, due to the long time (average 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus, it is difficult to overcome the difficulty.
As a brand new disease, COVID-19 has just begun its full clinical journey through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover without any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a higher incidence and mortality rate in severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease prediction model is essential for health care agencies, especially in resource-poor areas, to determine the priority of their services.
Based on the clinical studies recorded so far, the following factors may affect or relate to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting the recovery of SARS, and the same is true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 people with the disease, COVID-19 primarily affected 47.7% of people aged between 30-65 years.
Patients who needed intensive care already had both diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those who did not need such treatment (51 versus 66 in the median age group), suggesting that age was a factor in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Two diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care may suffer from acute heart disorder and blood nutrient deficiency.
Heart attacks are the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, causing liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that there is a strong correlation between age and chronic diseases and that they can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The amount of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of tissue damage or tissue aging. Further, the disease is proposed as the pre-diabetes factor for disease, treatment response, and eventual cure.
The link between CRP levels and prediction of the severity and recovery of COVID-19 is proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHT), aspartate amino replacement (AST), alanine amino replacement (ALD) and creatinine kinase (CK) can help predict results.
These enzymes are overexpressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissues are damaged.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver disorders.
Vital clinical symptoms: The temporal progression of breast irradiation and clinical symptoms, along with other problems of predicting the effects and complications of COVID-19 should be considered.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are the most commonly used anticoagulant therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage during infectious diseases.
Since high doses of propranolol were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease suffered from life-long disability and poor quality of life with bloodless skeletal tissue destruction.
Thus, if necessary, short-term steroids should be used for COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients are exposed to extraordinary distress due to prolonged quarantine and extreme instability and seeing the death of close family members and co-patients.
It is imperative that these patients receive psychological counseling and long-term support to recover from a mental breakdown and return to normal life.
Demographic studies so far have shown that the origins of COVID-19 are different from those of SARS.
In addition to multiplication of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also multiplies efficiently and effectively in the respiratory tract. In the early stages of infection, it, like other CoVs that cause colds, has little, or no symptoms.
Therefore, infected patients may produce a large number of pathogens during daily activities, either at the initial stage or at the interval of onset of symptoms, making it difficult to control the spread of the epidemic.
However, while most outbreaks do not occur in the early stages, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and more difficult to contain than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, special efforts have been made in Wuhan and surrounding cities, including lockdown and isolation of almost the entire population.
While these activities are seriously damaging the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is limited.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end by March and the decline period will last for 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are not so convinced.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which is more transmissible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini et al. established a model to predict the effects of the pandemic and suggested that two-thirds of the world's population would have SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A Canadian team has reported the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in the middle vertebral and throat swabs of patients who had recovered from the disease two weeks before they left the hospital, indicating that the newly discovered virus could circulate in the same manner as the flu.
However, given the declining number of new cases, there are signs of optimism in China, which indicates that current strategies are yielding results.
It was initially predicted that one million people would be infected with Ebola and half a million would die.
However, with strict isolation and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to become progressively extinct, or become a low-infectious pathogen that can coexist with humans.
Below is a comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing and sneezing and can also be spread by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus has also been found in feces, causing new possibilities for transmission from feces through the mouth.
A recent study of 138 infected people found that 41% of them, including 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers, had been infected by hospitalization.
Thus, special precautions should be taken to protect human beings, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients and even those who stand by the infected people.
The first line of defense that can reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face shields; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Rule <0x23>1860S) to help contain the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks avoid liquid droplets, which travel through the air from an infected person or attach to the surface of objects, where they can be passed on to others.
However, N95 (series <0x23>1860S) masks only provide protection from inhalation of microorganisms of 10 to 80 mm, of which only 5% are fully transmissible; SARS-CoV-2 has the same level as SARS-CoV, both of which are about the same as SARS-CoV.
Since the holes will be drilled through five stacked surgical masks, the healthcare providers who are in direct contact with the patients should wear N-95 (series <0x23> 1860S) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to face masks, health-care providers must wear appropriate quarantine gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes of individuals.
On 22nd January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear opaque masks or protective glasses when working with patients.
It is highly recommended that the general public in the affected or vulnerable areas wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soap, try to stay indoors by self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance to keep people safe from the patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection and at the same time preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has entered the world of human beings as a new virus, its overarching association with SARS-CoV, according to a January 7, 2020, report, must have created a state of alarm in China, based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control has been comforting citizens by saying that the new virus is less contagious, less human-to-human, and prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
This information eased the alertness of the public, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the crucial time to contain the disease was missed in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can take these difficult lessons and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be very careful when making public announcements, as each word may be taken into account by citizens and may alter their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and proactive to the extraordinary information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or authorities; (3) be proactive and proactive incentivizing the community to increase awareness and provide timely response to the extraordinary information coming from hospitals; and (3) be vigilant and seek to stop the epidemic with greater restraint at the initial stage, and (4) not to try to console the general public; and prevent the epidemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
At the time of writing this, less than two months later, it has spread all over China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
The virus being very similar to SARS-CoV and having similar symptoms between SARS and COVID-19 has created a sense of resurgence of SARS in the spread of COVID-19.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling and treating the spread of the pandemic.
COVID-19 affects more older adults than younger individuals, as well as men than women, and has a higher incidence and mortality rate among older adults than young people.
The fatality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus despite being asymptomatic, while SARS patients transmit the virus only if they are seriously ill, which is why it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, routine RNA (RNA) tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 show negative results.
On the other hand, if the recovered patients are tested, the virus can be detected again.
These findings can dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
While such rapid strides have been made in research related to COVID-19, several key issues remain unresolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic synonyms between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like two bat coronaviruses have been found, we are not yet able to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What animal species was responsible for the spread of the virus from bats to humans?
Without the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively cut off the spread. Also, the spread will restart as and when it needs to.
Molecular models and biochemical assessments have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2, but how does the virus enter the airway molecules and carry out subsequent pathogenic changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 releasing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to reach a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus mutate when it is transmitted between humans?
Is it a global pandemic, like SARS, or does it occur periodically, like a cold?
This is necessary, but it takes a little more time to search for the answers to the above and many more questions.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop the spread of this pandemic as quickly as possible and bring back our normal lives.
Animal-borne infection of human coronaviruses (HCoVs)
For thousands of years, genetic mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (coronaviruses) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two HCoVs (human coronaviruses) were known to cause mild to moderate disease, such as the common cold.
Severe outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have revealed how devastating and life-threatening the human coronavirus infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to the coronavirus and its high transmission but at the same time surprised us with the low prevalence compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus infection is of animal origin and it is useful for us to understand the animal origin of human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats; in them, they do not cause disease.
Interstitial stagnant spores of some human coronaviruses have also been known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
The study of CoV - host interactions in animals could provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery and current knowledge of their animal origin and inter-species transmission.
Importantly, we are comparing different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being discussed at this point.
In addition, the requirements for successful host mutations and the effects of virus evolution on disease severity are indicated.
Coronaviruses (coronaviruses) belong to the family 'Coronaviridae'; it consists of a group of enveloped, positive-energy, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have a gigantic genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" because of a visible crown-like structure as seen from an electron microscope.
Structurally, coronaviruses have segmented lineages that share a similar structure.
In the genome, approximately two-thirds consists of two large, overlapping reading frames (overlapping open reading frames (ORF1A, and ORF1B); these are converted into PP1A and PP1AB 'replications'.
These polyphenols are further processed to form 16 non-structured proteins, referred to as NSP 1-16.
The remaining part of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins, including pin (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The unique sub-proteins assigned to each heredity are encrypted by different inherited coronaviruses.
Based on the protein sequencing, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), of which most human coronaviruses are of the beta-coronavirus types, and are divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rodents function as the genetic source of most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds remain the main source of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continuously crossed racial barriers and, some of them, have evolved into important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus strains have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are more pathogenic, causing more severe lower respiratory tract nonrespiratory infections, and more severe respiratory tract infections (ARDS).
The first human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal excretion of mucormycosis in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-containment symptoms, through extensive studies.
In fact, it was widely accepted that infection by human coronaviruses was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people and taking the lives of about 10% of people.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) pandemic resulted in a series of epidemics on the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread widely to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is an ongoing coronavirus disease agent for the ongoing 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected over 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world must prepare for the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven types of HCoVs are animal-derived because they come from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolution of all HCoVs from bats, in which the pathogens are well-adapted and non-pathogenic but show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
The discovery of the zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and factors that control the spread between species.
This may guide or facilitate the search for the stagnant, intermediate and proliferating animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal origin of human coronaviruses, inter-species transmission, and pathogen formation.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural host, but become pathogenic in new host after interbreeding.
We are also reviewing the course of the evolution of the human coronavirus (HCoV) in which it has been found that morbidity decreases if the spread is increased.
The effects of the ongoing - SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known to exist since the late 1930s.
Different coronaviruses have been extracted from various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog, before extracting the strain B814 of HCoV-229E from the nasal mucosa of patients suffering from common cold.
In the last decade, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus chronologically (Table 1) will be illustrative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was extracted from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of regular cold such as headache, sneezing, ill-health and sore throat are observed, with fever and cough present in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was extracted from organ culture and pathways in the brains of mice.
The clinical features of infection with HCoV-OC43 are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract viruses such as influenza A and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread around the world and are transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, in the case of these two pathogens, the incubation period of the disease is less than a week, followed by a period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study conducted with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild to moderate common colds.
Severe lower respiratory tract infection was seen in only a few patients with immunodeficiency.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," is the first well-documented HCoV-infected and SARS-CoV pathogen in human history.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
There have been 8,096 cases of SARS with 774 deaths, which have spread to multiple countries and continents.
In addition to super-spreading, each infection is estimated to lead to approximately two secondary infections, with a time interval of 4 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms and the peak of the virus appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV are initially with muscle pain, headache, fever, illness and cold, followed by shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath.
Limbophenia, dysfunctional liver function tests, and high levels of the kinase of creatine are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
A wide range of lung cell damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and an increase in macrophages have been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive treatment and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, may also be affected in these severe infections, usually accompanied by the cytokine spiral, which can be particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient at Index Hospital who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to human coronavirus research.
HCoV-NL63 was first isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be widespread in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by the human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 is caused by Coryza, inflammation of the lungs, fever and bronchitis.
Another independent study described extracting the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and its peak events occur in summer, spring and winter.
The human coronavirus - NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is associated with obstructive laryngeal inflammation, also known as the vertebrae.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was extracted from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is thought to be associated with an increase in severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are also well-adapted to humans and are generally less likely to cause potentially fatal diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons, like the rare occurrence of a more serious subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively spread and continue to hold themselves within humans, they become less severe or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, infections with secondary outbreaks caused by close contacts that may occasionally come from outside have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced severe renal failure, which has so far been unique to MERS in human coronavirus-causing diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, confirmed cases in more than 2,500 laboratories have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid-December to late 2019, clusters of pneumonia known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases globally, with a severe case fatality of 3.4%.
Notably, there has been a 4.2% fatality in Hubei, China, whereas outside it there has been only 1.2% fatality.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe respiratory infections accompanied by fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Diarrhoea is seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms, and it can quickly spread to severe respiratory tract syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% higher nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but more transmissible.
There have been reports of patients being infected without symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is likely to spread rapidly around the world.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses will reveal similarities and differences between them.
First of all, the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the duration of human coronavirus disease are the same.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs received by the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the one hand, reveals features that are common during infections with community-transmitted human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including those that are not significant, moderate, or with no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of people who have been severely affected by COVID-19 have also been found to have SARS-CoV infection, although its rate is slightly lower.
Third, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns of both HCoV and SARS-CoV that have been acquired by the community.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was lower than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases in humans in a phased manner, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will make it clear whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role, at least in some situations, as in SARS-CoV.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 reveals itself in the same way as the cases of HCoVs (HCoVs) that are circulating in the community.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, pathogenesis and stable transmission after entering the human body, will now influence the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The four HCoVs acquired by the community that cause mild symptoms are also well matched to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have been well-educated with these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient human coronavirus pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases have been eliminated in humans and in humans who have developed severe HCoV diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that resist host control factors.
In this way, when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts longer and affects more people, it is more likely to become fully compatible with humans.
If this changes according to the situation, it is difficult to prevent the spread of infection to humans through extraction or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four coronaviruses that have been acquired by the community have spread in the human population, triggering the common cold in humans who do not have immunity.
These viruses do not require animal sacrificial animals.
In contrast, the highly virulent pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well matched to humans, and therefore cannot extend their transmission to humans.
They need to survive and multiply in their animal way stagnants and have the opportunity to move to more vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four HCoVs present in the community.
At least in the current context, it is highly transmissible, like the social-linked HCoV viruses
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it can be fully adapted to humans and spread to humans without stagnant or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the origins of human coronaviruses on animals, it would be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution of human coronaviruses, nature, intermediate and proliferation of hosts.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor who shares a high similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence, it acts as the evolutionary host of an HCoV
This ancestral virus usually adapts itself to the host and is not contagious in the host.
Similarly, the stagnant host sustains the human coronavirus continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, it will not fit well with the new host and will often cause disease.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and can play the role of a multiplying host by allowing the virus to replicate intermittently and then pass it on to humans to multiply the level of human infection.
If an HCoV virus is unable to sustain its spread in an intermediate host, it may be subject to end-stage infection.
On the contrary, HCoVs can be modified with an intermediate host and can also produce long-term infection.
In this, the intermediate host becomes a natural stagnant host.
Epidemiological data has revealed that the first known infectious game of SARS had a history of contact with animals.
During the subsequent epidemiological study, it was pointed out that animal traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV immune protein compared to the general population.
In live animal markets, masculin palm civets (Bakuma larvata) and raccoon dogs were the first to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses.
No further SARS outbreaks have been reported after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked snake penetrating cats from forest or farms without contact to live animal markets are often negative for SARS-CoV. These masked snake penetrating cats may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not as a natural reservator of SARS
In particular, it cannot be denied that many types of small mammals may also have acted as intermediate aggregator hosts of SARS-CoV, as different animals in markets in Guangzhou contain 80% of SARS-CoV antibodies.
All of these appear to be end-stage hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
The search for the SARS coronavirus' natural animal host, the SARS-associated rhinolopus bat in the Chinese equine bats exposed the SARS coronavirus HKU3 (Sars R-H-Vaul coronavirus HQ3), a closely related virus.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs have a nucleotide sequence similarity of 88-92%, with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats are the only ones that contain emerging human pathogens.
Many CoVs, such as SARS, have been identified from bats, but nothing can be extracted as a living virus except a distinct WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a receptor for SARS-CoV.
The WIV1, derived from a fecal sample of bats, was demonstrated to be able to use bats, civets and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the lymphatic system of symptomatic SARS patients is capable of neutralizing WIV1 (WIV1).
So far, WIV1 refers to the closest ancestor of the SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% nucleic acid sequencing.
Despite the high similarity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent pathogen of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analyses suggest that the MERS-CoV virus is identical to the same group of bats as the CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
The HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
Among bat beta-coronaviruses identified from Europe and Africa, the RNA-based RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are genetically close to the RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the bat coronavirus-HKU25, share only 87% nucleic acid sequencing.
So, bats may not be the immediate stagnant host of MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that monogamous camels are clear-cut to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern descent in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV), which is similar to the virus found in humans, has been extracted from the nostrils of camels in the monotone, indicating that camels act as true reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that test-infected camels with MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms but a large number of exposures to the virus.
Affected camels shed pathogens not only through the respiratory tract but also through fecal-oral route, which is the main way the pathogen sheds in bats.
However, since many of MERS's confirmed disease outbreaks do not have a history of contact with camels before the appearance of the symptom, they are said to be unknown transmission routes involving human-to-human transmission or unrecognized animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2, extracted from rhinovirus bats, shares 96.2% nucleic acid similarities with the bat coronavirus RADG13.
Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is great enough to create a parental relationship.
This means that unless there are virtually identical bat coronaviruses in the near future, bats cannot be immediate stagnant hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wildlife species sold and killed at Huanan's seafood wholesale market, with which many of the early instances of COVID-19 have been associated, an animal-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on alternative genomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals called ants (Manis javanica) may also possess ancestral beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The novel ant virus genes share 85-92% of the nucleic acid sequence homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RADG13 with about 90% of the sign at the level of the nucleic acid sequence.
They join two sub-lineages of viruses in the genomic tree, such as SARS-CoV-2, one of which shares a very similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In contrast, the RBD gents of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are very different, although they are genetically similar in size.
Previous studies on diseased ants have reported detection of viral contagions from pulmonary samples, which are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different combination methods and genome determination to create a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 is pangolins.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct ant origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus-2 associated with SARS-CoV-2 of the pancreas.
An evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is to be established in bats, ants and other mammals.
The highest-order similarity has been found in RPDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, with beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 sharing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and RADG high-order.
One of the best speculations is that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is driven by selective mediated convergent evolution.
A third wild animal species is an ant that has a counter-plan to recombine between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, the phenomenon of recombination among beta-coronaviruses is widespread.
The jury has not yet been included in the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Apart from highly virulent HCoVs, animal studies of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been carried out.
Genetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HK1 have been found in animal parents of HCoV-U.
A bat coronavirus known as Appalachian Ridge Corona Virus.2, detected in a North American triplet, has been reported to have shown close association with the human coronavirus HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus known as Hippociteros/Kanakwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current data on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figures 1 and 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence for the inter-species transmission of human coronaviruses throughout history.
A pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded in 1890 when the HCoV-OC43 species crossed over to infect humans from domestic livestock.
The history of interbreeding of HCoV-229E is unclear.
A new strain of bat-alpha-coronavirus, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been identified.
Among them is alpaca-alpha-coronavirus.
There is evidence that the virus spreads directly from bats to humans.
First of all, humans are not alpacas, and humans are the only ones who can communicate with bats in a shared environment.
Humans, on the other hand, have a close relationship with animals.
Secondly, bat-alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are different and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca-alpha-coronavirus caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha-coronavirus is not found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility of alkaloids getting alpha-coronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens with human pathogens, including the Rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs act as genetic banks of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, much like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of transmission from bats to camels in single-celled organisms and from camels to humans in single-celled organisms.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from when it was first identified and has been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
It is obvious that bats act as a convenient storage bank for viral species for genetic separation and animal transmission.
Long life, dense groups, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to become a better 'virus spreader'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been introduced to camels for decades.
This virus has adapted well to camels and has transformed the camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes disease at a very moderate rate and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its scattered spread to humans is an accident, and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as it cannot sustain its spread.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of ants in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, would be different.
In particular, beta-coronavirus ants are more pathogenic in ants.
As in the case of SARS-CoV, they may be the final host for beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
Many possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be proven or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats may be a stagnant host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the newly introduced intermediate amplification hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans try to get the virus by consuming the meat of butchers and hunting animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Analysis of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and matching of SARS-CoV-2 may have developed in a third species of bats and ants.
The search for the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the various types of animal hosts, three major factors on the part of pathogens help CoVs cross racial barriers.
First, the relatively high mutation rates in their RNA - RNA transcription.
Compared to other single-separated RNA viruses, where the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high," the average conversion rate is approximately 4 out of 10 per year for the site, which may vary to novel hosts depending on the stage of the CoV.
Coronaviruses contain error-seeking exorbitant alkaloids, and eliminating them results in a very high level of mutation and weariness or inactivity.
Interestingly, the nucleic acid analog remdesivir has been known to suppress coronary virus transcription by inhibiting the exosophoretic and ribonucleic acid (RNA-RNA)-based ribonucleotide (RNA-RNA) polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the genetic mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the genetic mutation rate is often higher when HCoVs do not fit well with the host.
The rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, indicating a high degree of adaptiveness in humans.
Indirectly, it has already been modified to another host that is closer to humans.
In addition, this applies not only to SARS-CoV-2, but also to MERS-CoV, which is adaptive to monogamous camels.
Theoretically, it would render the gene, vaccines, and antiviral vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in CoVs injects additional plasticity in the gene change for mutations and rearrangement, thereby increasing the probability for the co-evolution of spaces, which is favorable for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate
It is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the gene.
Third, CoVs change their preforms randomly and frequently during the ribonucleotide (RNA - RNA) transcription through a unique "copy-selection" technique.
In a host that acts as a mixing agent, strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly synchronized full-length and subatomic riboproteins (RNA-RNA) may recombine to form new coronaviruses.
The ethnographic evidence of natural recombination is present in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in bat-like SARS-CoV and bat-like coronavirus-HBV9.
Viral <0xE2><0x80><0x93>vegetative interaction with respect to propagation
In addition to the above three pathogenic factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing interbreeding.
Here, a recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a notable example, revealing evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between the isolations of human and penile cat SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV will undergo rapid adaptation at different hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD in the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the receptor made by the organism and is actively selected by the host's immune response.
In the SARS-CoV, RBT is present in the S1 fragment, in amino acids from 318th to 510th, which binds to human ACE2 and its central receptors for virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of sensing ACE2 receptors of various animals including bat, bat, civet, rat and raccoon dog, making interbreeding of the virus species possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ from human and civet virus extractions in RPD, of which 4 are in the receptor-binding characteristic for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, increasing the association of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both of these amino acid alternatives are likely to be important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same biomarker ana receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the binding relationship of its S protein with human ACE2 in the S1 unit of the S protein may have changed.
In fact, a Cryo-EM study indicates that there is a 10 to 20 times greater relationship in this bond than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other co-acceptance is needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The novel coronavirus HCoV-NL63 binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are several human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after animal transmission of their animal hosts
As cell receptors go, the effect of HCoV transmission is also governed by other host dependency and control factors.
The differentiation of these host proteins between humans and the natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, camels, and rodents in a single whale can be a barrier to interbreeding.
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) must capture host dependency factors and reduce host control factors for successful interbreeding.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of pathogen-infected contacts will be identified and classified.
Impartial genome-level testing of host dependency and control factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR will be fruitful.
Exposure to novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs): From start to finish
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the development of novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
In this case, bat CoVs act as the genetic bank of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid gene mutation and genetic recombination drive the evolution of the human coronavirus (HCoV), and this process serves two important stages.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coded genes has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
In SARS-CoV sub-proteins, it is thought that the adaptation of ORF8 to humans is important because SARS-CoV-related bat pathogens are isolated but encrypt different ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide elimination trait of SARS-CoVs has been identified as an isolated strain at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of host.
Besides, SARS-CoV has a history of recombination with the genomes of alpha and gamma CoVs, in which numerous small recombination regions have been identified in the RNA-based RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Restorative sites were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and also in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, a pandemic called MERS-CoV (Mers-CoV) has been found to have recombined between different genera, occurring in camels in a singlet in Saudi Arabia.
With the exception of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events are seen in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs combine with other animal coronaviruses with their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unexpected changes in viral genes, often resulting in the release of pathogens from test pressures such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in HCoV-229E original strains due to two nucleic acid deletions.
Alpaca alpha-coronavirus shows single nucleic acid insertion, resulting in a transmutation due to the presence of harmless ORF4 in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E.
One last thing, the evolution of novel HCoVs is driven by the selective pressure in their host cells.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected by CoVs, indicating the mutual affinity between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be well-adapted to coronaviruses both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, deficiencies in the activation of an inflammatory reaction in bats effectively reduce the pro-inflammatory reaction by coronary pathogens.
In addition, the activity of natural killing cells in bats is suppressed by the antiregulation of the natural killing cells receptor NKG2/CD94, and due to the low exposure level of class I molecules with major tissue polypeptides.
Further, high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats suppress the coronavirus replication and affect the validation by the exotropo cane, thus providing the strain for the generation of pathogenic metabolites that are more pathogenic when introduced into a new host cell.
Highly pathogenic coronavirus metabolites may be formed by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for ombre adaptation.
It is no coincidence that three novel human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses cause mild symptoms that are non-pathogenic or their stagnant host, such as bats and camels.
They replicate aggressively without triggering a strong host immune reaction.
Here are the secrets as to why asymptomatic carriers are found and what causes severe infections in human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly caused by the stimulation of the immune response and the cytokine spiral, in which the immune response is strong, while the lung damage is more severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been eliminated from the coronavirus replication.
The same technique for eliminating the immune response may be beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The antiviral response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the injection of type I interferon may be effective in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 (NLRP3) inflammatory activation in bats is deficient.
Through this reasoning, it was known that inhibition of NLRP3 (NLRP3) influenzae with MCC950 (MCC950) may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 follow the common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bats have been found to have 95% nucleotide-smelling similarity sharing with SARS-CoV, bats that share 96% nucleotide-smelling similarity with SARS-CoV-2 also have coronavirus.
Cats and other animals in the markets have been found to have similar pathogens to SARS-CoV, although no immediate intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Anthrax beta-coronaviruses have been identified that are similar to SARS-CoV-2, which can either act as one of the host or can act as one of the host beta-coronavirus viruses to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally created by man.
Coronaviruses have come to light again after the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the animal origin of human transmission and the importance of animal reservoirs of HCoVs.
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have originated from bat bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-CoV infection originates from interactions between humans and civets on the market, the SARS epidemic could be effectively ended by closing meat markets and killing civets.
In view of the discovery of several genes of ant beta-coronavirus pathogens closely related to SARS-CoV-2, for the same reason, ants should be removed from meat markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by ants and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in camels for decades.
These camels are an important tool for transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS virus, as was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent a series of MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be put in place to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new genetic variants can emerge and cause severe transmission.
There are a variety of animal-derived CoVs circulating around the zoo.
In particular, bat coronaviruses capable of zoonotic infection are very different.
There is ample opportunity for these animal-borne CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the formation of new CoVs that could be more transmissible and/or dangerous to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned.
Along with the trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there must also be a well-prepared response plan.
In fact, many viruses have been present in the galaxy for a very long time.
They will remain in their natural habitat until they are able to reproduce.
Although bats have many positive aspects to the spread of viruses, knowledge of this can reduce the chance that humans will come into contact with bats and other wildlife species.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which can be useful in preventing the transmission from animals to humans and infection that may occur in the future.
In the end, the best way to prevent the virus's zoonotic transmission is to keep humans away from the ecological sites of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to ants, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and ants share the same ecological significance.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the spread of humans, we need to find out how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must clarify how it interacts with a variety of organisms, including humans, bats and ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection must be conducted.
If it is bats, ants or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses are expected to be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuous reviews in this area clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 "suspected case" and "confirmed case"
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a rapid advisory guide for the detection and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and made an excellent reference for the fight against this pandemic globally.
It is to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge through ongoing research and clinical practice experiences are gradually increasing; hence, strategies and treatments for detecting the infection are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our guidance and provided new diagnostic criteria issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, now officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our team has developed a Quick Instructional Guideline and it has been published on the Army Medical Review website on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
It is to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing with the ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; hence, the strategies and treatments for detecting the infection are also constantly being updated
For example, the liturgy (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, consists of seven editions, some of which have changed significantly.
Now we have feedback from Chu and others on our guidance and they have introduced a simple assessment based on their medical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and the best data for the whole world to know about this pandemic.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and express our gratitude.
However, their work must be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment protocols for COVID-19 and the latest studies.
As of the seventh edition (3 March 2020), it is mandatory to link two subjects of clinical expression to an analysis that involves at least one or all of the infectious components to confirm infection, or, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, to satisfy three subjects of clinical expression.
History of infection: (1) Traveled to or resided in the city of Wuhan, or in other community areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact with a person who has been exposed to the virus (confirmed by indoor acid test) and has had contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 in the past 2 weeks; (3) contact with a person who has been exposed to the virus in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or who has been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms
Clinical manifestations: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory distress; (2) appearances of COVID-19 infection; (3) overall white blood cell count normal, low, or decreased in filtration at the onset of transmission.
Diagnosing a confirmed case should base the suspected case with any pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) positive PCR test positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in real-time; (2) viral full genome sequencing showing greater integrity to known novel coronaviruses at the stage; (3) positive IgM antibody and IgGG-2 to specific IgSA-positive in serum testing.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for the presence of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Additions to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions on the pathogenesis in blood samples; subsequent additions to the seventh edition of the epidemiological evidence.
These changes, based on the researchers, continued the work of looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection device for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported bringing specific antibody positive result on confirmed criteria.
Besides, we have more and more evidence to be cautious with varying symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
"Therefore, the roadmap of Chu and others classifying people with no clinical symptoms as ""low risk"" needs to be updated."
There is also a need to review the score system in medical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we invite readers to express their views.
We recommend that the new guidelines set out in each country be established and adhered to in order to establish a diagnosis between 'persons suspected of having the disease' and 'confirmed persons'.

Bangladesh has recorded five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day, the highest number of daily deaths.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the number of infections recorded by Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IETCR) is 114 with cases and 33 with recoveries.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online news conference, Dr Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, Director of IETCR, said that four men and one woman were killed in the accident.
According to Dr. Meerjadi, two persons are above 60 years of age, two persons are between 51 to 60, and 41-50 years of age.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission (BCC), who was being treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital, was among the dead, a hospital official told local news agency Anadolu.
Bangladesh Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said in a video statement on Saturday that public transport will be suspended for a longer time than originally planned until Saturday.
The public transport stop was initially scheduled to start on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - is still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8 were recorded for two people who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them,
As of March 19, all three have already returned.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 1 million people worldwide.
The total number of coronavirus infections for SARS-CoV-2 surpassed one million on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection, which means that Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea says it is one of the few countries that has not reported a coronavirus case as of Thursday.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization had recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 new cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10 a.m. on April 4. Central European Time (0800 UTC)
More than 244 thousand cases have been reported in the US, which are linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people in the United States had died from the coronavirus on Wednesday.
Countries around the world are taking drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that the city's closure had been extended until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
A vote was held in Portugal's parliament to extend the state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one counter-vote.
Saudi Arabia extended a day-long curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; previously, the curfew was in effect only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand has imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has extended his stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia are reducing the amount of toilet paper for a transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles took control of all of their stores nationally, with two and one pack per transaction, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI introduced the definition of one pack per person.
These limits were posted as news on the fronts of exits and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
As people self-isolate, it is known that consumers are hoarding goods due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a single packet.
The changes followed a four-pack rate for an earlier transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"Goles, in his March 8 media release, called the four-package restriction ""still in effect"" and called the request ""unprecedented"", while the ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected""."
A Woolworths spokesman said last week's sales had increased 'sharply'.
Costco's store in Canberra also restricted the allowed amount to two parcels last week.
To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles not only placed an order for larger packages from suppliers but also increased delivery times. Woolworths placed an order for additional reserves, while ALDI prepared reserves for a planned special sale on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that while retailers were trying to raise reserves, local forum restrictions on the delivery time of goods made it harder.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet the demand, as critical raw materials are scarce.
On Tuesday, following the pre-release of the stock, ALDI announced that some shops will not be able to operate the special Wednesday.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail business expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill stock every night.
He said toilet paper is a bulky item that leads to a limited amount of stock, and then after everything has been sold, a sense of scarcity is further strengthened when you see that the vast shelves are all empty.
'Colles and Woolworths have the idea that if there is a lot of material on the shelf, such as toilet paper and cleaning products [which can be purchased] in large quantities, it can reduce the risk of fear,' Russell Zimmerman said in an interview with ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Grape said on Wednesday that they would be out of stock.
The Kimberley-Clark Company, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper Company, which makes Sorbent, claim to be working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a News.com.au report.
According to domain.com, a web site for home buying and selling that offered to sell properties to provide free toilet paper to first bidders at auctions in Melbourne, there were fewer bids because buyers were on vacation during the long weekend on Labor Day.
In the Thursday edition of the daily tabloid NT News, Darwin provided an eight-page plug-in that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a news report by ABC Australia on March 3, the shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a high demand for other items, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the virtual UK supermarket Okado Andres limited the purchase of toilet paper to two 12-coil packs.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared COVID-19 a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
"While the term ""pandemic"" refers to how widespread a disease has spread, it is not how dangerous the specific diseases are, so the World Health Organization (WHO) noted the need for governments to step in:"
'All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
"Countries must find, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their populations,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said."
'The alarming increase in the spread and severity of the disease, and the lack of action on this front, is a matter of grave concern.'
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic was 'unprecedented.'
In a note published on CNN in February, he said, 'Except for the flu, no other respiratory pathogens have been observed since the emergence of the virus.'
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, 'We have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before.'
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time, he said.
In January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, 'Basically, it's going to get worse.'
As of Thursday, the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide stood at 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths, according to the Associated Press.
The 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic caused by the currently active severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30th, 2020. It was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
More than 364,000 people have recovered.
While the fatality rate in China is 4%, globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can take two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Preliminary treatment is symptomatic and supportive care, including hand washing, covering one's mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation from persons suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, enforcing lockdowns, risk control at the workplace, and closing workplaces.
The pandemic has led to serious international socioeconomic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies due to tension and hoarding.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and there have been incidents of alien intimidation and discrimination against Chinese people, people from East and South East Asia, people with similar appearances, and people from other regions with significant exposure to the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased with fewer trips and the closure of heavy industries.
Health officials in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, said a large number of people were diagnosed with bronchitis without knowing what caused it on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began as early as January 2020.
These patients often had contacts with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the pathogen is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus known as SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread is also a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, ant colony coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The person who developed the virus on 1 December 2019 was also exposed to the virus.
In the early-stage batch of victims in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-connected.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post reported on 13-March 2020 that the 55-year-old patient from Hubei province may have been the first patient and that this may have happened on November 17, 2019. While the influx of new patients has decreased in China, the sudden increase in new patients in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on February 26, 2020, that the number of new patients coming for treatment outside China for the first time exceeded the number of those coming into China.
There may have been a significantly lower incidence of infection, especially among people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, only a relatively small number of young patients have been reported, with only 2.4% of patients aged 19 and under globally. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would have to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
These indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and those tests have been confirmed as per the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of January 23 were undiagnosed, with these undiagnosed infections spreading the disease to 79% of confirmed patients.
The statistical analysis, published on March 30, estimates that there may be a significantly higher number of infections than was publicly reported in Italy.
Initial estimates of the base reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the number to be 5.7.
Many people who have been affected by COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not do so, the time period from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of those who died were over the age of 60, and 75% of these patients had pre-existing illnesses, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official guidelines generally count only those who have tested positive for the coronavirus and have died from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher as it may not include people who die without being tested - e.g. at home, in care homes, etc.
A partial data from Italy has found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official coronavirus death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, ""We know that [the number of deaths] has been underestimated."" This is a report corroborated by a small number of profiling reports in the United States. Such undervaluation often occurs when infections occur, and the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020."
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, while the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
Before February 28, more than a dozen deaths each were reported outside the Chinese mainland, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, deaths had been reported in more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
The number varies over time depending on the region, and they vary by the amount being tested, the quality of the health system, treatment choices, demographic characteristics such as the time of onset of the disease to the present, age, gender, and overall health. The number of patients and the mortality rate, the number of deaths, is divided by the number of patients diagnosed in a given time interval.
As per Johns Hopkins University data, the global case fatality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as on 10th April 2020
The number varies by region.
In China, the ratio estimates between patients and the dead ranged from 17.3% (symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the patient mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of confirmed patients who die from a disease, and the mortality rate (CFR-CFR).
These figures are not time-bound and follow a specific group of people who have been infected through the course of the disease.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate this number for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the mortality rate during the pandemic was between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum assessment of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and the statistical study that analyses the impact of the test on CFR assessments.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the infection are uncertain and may differ by location.
"Maggie Bonny of Penn State University said, ""Unchecked, the spread of the virus usually peaks unchanged and then the host begins to decline in the gut."
"But at the moment it is almost impossible to make any sensible plan about when it will be."""
Zhang Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, insisted that 'it will be over by June' if all countries can be mobilised to follow the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of London's School of Health and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 was ""certainly going to be in circulation, lasting for one or two years."""
"According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, ""physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (which can take 18 months or more)."
"William Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, said: ""I don't think this coronavirus is going to disappear completely because it's instantly transmissible, and it could turn into a seasonal disease and come back every year."""
When an infection recurs, its vigor depends on the population's immunity and the genetic makeup of the virus.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively undefined and those infected may be asymptomatic.
Fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) are common symptoms.
Common symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or bruising.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluishing of the face or lips as symptoms of an emergency. If these symptoms occur, it is advised to seek immediate medical attention. If the disease progresses, symptoms of pneumonia, acute respiratory illness, blood poisoning (sepsis), shock, and even death may occur.
Since some of those infected are asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, and the infection is confirmed as per the test results, the researchers have advised that those who have close contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and tested to be free of infection.
The Chinese estimate that the asymptomatic rate ranges from small to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the duration of onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is usually five days. An example of uncertainty is that in people with COVID-19, the initial estimate of loss of smell was 30%, and then dropped to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread primarily through close contact, as well as through small droplets that form when coughing, sneezing or talking; in this case, close contact is 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) away.
Studies have shown that even when coughing or sneezing, the droplets can travel from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by the presence of small droplets that can pass through the air when speaking. Although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air, including when speaking, respiratory droplets can also pass out when the air is exhaled.
Liquid droplets may pass into the mouth or nose of nearby people or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Respiratory tract glands can be sprayed through certain medical procedures such as inhalation and heart breathing (CPR), as a result of which the virus can spread into the air.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns that it may spread through feces, it is believed that the likelihood of such a fall is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from fecal matter through the mouth. The virus is highly contagious during the first three days of symptoms, but it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
Some people have been confirmed to have been infected three days before the onset of symptoms, so it is possible to spread the infection even before significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infections, but some countries have identified that asymptomatic transmission took place during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although there is no clear data on the spread of the disease, one is usually able to transmit the virus to two to three people. The virus survives on surfaces for a few hours to several days.
Specifically, the virus has been found to live for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 grade steel, one day on cardboard and four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature and has also been confirmed for COVID-19 in pets and other animals.
While there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals as if infected people may have come into contact with them after contact with other surfaces.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first isolated from three people infected with pneumonia in Wuhan who came in contact with a group of patients with acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 occur naturally in the associated CoVs. Because of the dissolution of its protective coverings outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have spread from animals to humans.
The genetic analysis has revealed that the Sarpekovirus (Genotype B) gene is in the genus Coronavirus, Beta Coronavirus, with two strands derived from bats in the inner general genus Sarpecovirus.
This is similar to other bat coronavirus samples (Vaval Corona RTG13) by 96% of the total genome size.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in specific areas of the genome sequence between the pathogens taken from ants and the pathogens that have spread to humans.
To date, a full-genomic comparison of ants with 92% of the shared genetic material between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not enough to prove ants as an intermediate host.
The virus infection can be detected temporarily on the basis of symptoms, but can be confirmed only by antibody transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRD-PCR) in the secretions of the infection or CD-normal drawing.
A study in Wuhan compared PCR to CT has suggested that although many of the graphical aspects of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, the effects of CT are significantly more pronounced than those of PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""the use of the CT method should not be used as a first-line test or screening test for COVID-19""."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released the multi-retroviral (RNA) testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first protocol released on January 17.
Experimental reverse transcription uses polymerase chain reaction (RRD-PCR) in real-time.
Tests can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Although a throat swab can also be used, in general, the test is performed on the nasal swab. Many laboratories and organizations are developing endocrine test methods to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
CELLEX's plagiarism test has been approved for emergency use only by accredited laboratories in the United States.
Characteristic drawing features of radiographs and CT on people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral mirror opacity and non-blaral fluids.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international web-based database of standard draft findings for infectious disease-positive individuals.
The normal drafting without PCR confirmation is specific to the identification of COVID-19 as it is combined with other infections such as adenovirus.
A large-scale study carried out in China has demonstrated that while comparing chest CT results to PCR is less likely to be accurate, it is quicker and more accurate in predicting outcomes, suggesting that the CT method can be considered a diagnostic tool for assessing the impact of the pandemic.
Artificial intelligence-based transforming neural networks have been developed to detect the virus' draft characteristics using both radiographs and CT.
Strategies include maintaining personal hygiene as a whole, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and performing activities such as coughing or sneezing on a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a trash can to prevent the spread of the disease.
Those already infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Many governments have banned travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak and against all non-essential travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members may not know where or how they got infected. It is recommended to take regular precautions, touch precautions and eye protection while taking care of those who may have been infected. Monitoring of contacts is an important means for health authorities to determine the source of infection and avoid further spread.
The government's use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has sparked controversy over a breach of privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restraint on the use of this form of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, including recording a user's proximity to other phones using Bluetooth.
Users will receive a text message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Misconceptions are being spread about how to prevent infection; for example, nose washing and mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but several organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds. Specifically, it is recommended to wash their hands after returning to the toilet, or after looking at the hands; before eating; and after sneezing or sneezing.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap when its protective bubble is blown away.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content in the absence of soap and water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands.
Surfaces can be purified by a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfection of the steel surface), including 62<0xE2><0x80><0x93>71% ethanol, 50<0xE2><0x80><0x93>100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% boviton-iodine.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends disinfection of office premises, toilets, common areas used by persons who are suspected to be infected with COVID, or have been infected, such as an office or day care centre. and prescribes disinfection of handhelds, touch screens, keyboards, remote drives, payment machines, etc.
Health agencies also recommend that people bend the elbow during coughing or sneezing or covering the mouth and nose with tissue and immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are infected, as wearing a mask will limit the size of the droplets and the distance of travel exposed when speaking, sneezing, and breathing when coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, ""the lack of proper hand hygiene is a major cause of the spread of the disease, and by wearing a mask, people will reduce their tendency to touch their faces."" It is also recommended that those who may have been exposed to the virus wear a mask."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy individuals wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries are encouraging people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC (CDC) recommends wearing a mask that is not used in medical use made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of medical masks that are flammable for healthy people, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or when in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have also banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam issued a call for everyone to wear a mask in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering the grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a mask when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing more than 10 million masks a day since March, ordered passengers on trains and city buses to wear masks from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask whenever going out, while recommending home-made masks for those who can't afford a mask.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures that delay the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Instructions include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or business centres.
Individuals can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding congested areas, using start-up-free greetings, and distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in areas where there is an outbreak.
The maximum number of congregations recommended by US government agencies and health authorities has been reduced from 250 (in case of no COVID-19 outbreak in a region) to 50 and then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. The WHO recommends that people with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and immunocompromised people should avoid ""conjunctivitis"", ""contact disorders"", ""hygienic conditions"", ""hygienic conditions"", ""hygienic conditions"", ""hygienic conditions"", ""health"" etc., and ""World March 2020"" recommends to stay indoors as much as much as possible."
The use of the phrase 'social distancing' has allowed people to feel isolated from society as a whole, rather than promoting alternative contact with each other. Some authorities have even issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
It is also recommended to have sex with the person only if you are living with the person who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
People with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation and many governments have made it mandatory or prescribed self-isolation for the entire population living in the affected areas.
Strong self-quarantine instructions have been issued for groups at high risk of spreading the disease.
Those who are likely to have come in contact with someone who has had COVID-19 and have recently travelled to a country or region where there is a high prevalence of the disease are advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of last exposure.
Controlling or suppressing and mitigation are strategies to control the impact of the disease.
In the early stages of the outbreak, measures are taken to detect and isolate those infected, and to introduce other measures to control the infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts then move to mitigation: steps are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society
Both prevention and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously together.
More intensive measures are needed to contain the spread of the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1. This is an attempt to reduce the peak of the epidemic as part of managing the epidemic outbreak, called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of large outbreaks that cannot be tackled by health services and gives more time for vaccines and treatments to be prepared.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the spread include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing a mask and self-quarantine; social activities aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling events where people gather; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental activities such as surface cleaning, etc.
Other countries have taken steps to control the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who had been infected and quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has also increased mask production and imposed fines on the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (preventing but not stopping the spread of the disease) and suppression (modifying the development of the epidemic) pose major challenges.
Better preventive policies could reduce peak health care needs by two-thirds and halved deaths, but could result in tens of thousands of deaths and straining of health systems.
Measures suppression can be prioritized, but it should be protected as long as the virus is spreading in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), as re-spreading may occur when measures are relaxed.
The long-term intervention to contain the pandemic is causing social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug against COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking anticoagulant medications, drinking fluids, and taking rest may help to limit the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) also said that a few ""traditional and home remedies"" could provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19."
Augmenting capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a basic response to the spread of the disease.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at several levels, including centralizing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-mandatory practices as much as possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first person (called the patient zero) contracted the disease.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei gradually increased.
These are often linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. And one theory is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, an animal-borne infection. A pneumonia caused by an unknown cause was discovered on December 26 and given to the Hubei province hospital by Dr. Zhang Jigsian.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ay Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization (WHO).
In early January, health officials in Wuhan were informed of patients with insufficiently diagnosed pneumonia, enough to launch an investigation. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of patients doubled about once every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China with the help of the Chinese New Year migration and the presence of Wuhan as a transit hub and main line junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least 200 countries and territories have been affected.
Due to the massive spread of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted their interstate movement and set border controls.
National reactions include quarantines (called stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines under lockdown, and about 59 million people in South Africa under lockdown, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, when 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, the figure rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Wuhan was reported on December 1, 2019; another unconfirmed case was confirmed on November 17, 2019 itself.
Dr. Zhang Jixian detected a cluster of patients with pneumonia with unknown cause on December 26. The Wuhan Jiangan CDC was informed of this on December 27 by the hospital where he worked.
Preliminary genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public announcement was made by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed.
As soon as these notifications were issued, police warned doctors in Wuhan that they were 'spreading rumours' about the outbreak.
"China's National Health Commission initially insisted there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched an aggressive campaign, described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China, as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus."
"Described as the ""largest quarantine in human history,"" a sanitization lockdown was announced on January 23 to halt travel in and out of Wuhan, which expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people."
Private use of public transport is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
The construction of Huoshenshan Hospital, a temporary hospital, was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Leishen Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities, such as conference centres and sports stadiums, into temporary hospitals in Wuhan. On January 26, the government undertook additional measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country have been closed.
Many activities were carried out in the regions of Hong Kong and Macau, especially those related to schools and universities.
Remote working activities were established in many Chinese circles.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been rerouted and museums across China are temporarily closed.
With public movement restrictions imposed in several cities, it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of external restrictions. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from 'importing' from other countries.
For example, the Beijing administration implemented a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals in the city. On March 23, the mainland of China, until five days ago, had only one case of domestically transmitted infection, which was spread by a passenger who had returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that domestic transmission of the virus had been stopped and that China was under control.
Apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was enforced, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei on the same day. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March-26, 2020 that entry permits for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen, and also offered cash incentive packages to the companies. The State Council announced the start of a one-day mourning day with a three-minute silence tribute nationally on April 4 at 10:00 p.m., which was coordinated with the King's Festival. The central government asked families to pay respect online to maintain physical distancing to avoid the resurgent COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases on February 20, attributed to a gathering in Daegu on behalf of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 people following that church, 1,261 or 13 percent had reported symptoms. South Korea issued a very high level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, up from 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been evacuated after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedules were also affected, so they were rearranged. South Korea launched what is thought to be the world's largest and best-organised program to detect the spread of the virus among the general public, isolate them in case of infection, trace those who came in contact with them, and isolate them.
The diagnostic methods include mandatory self-declaration of symptoms of new international travellers through the mobile app, drive-through testing of viral impact based on the results available the next day, and increasing the testing capacity to up to 20,000 people per day.
Despite not isolating the entire city, South Korea's plan is considered successful in containing the spread. Initially, there were two differing opinions in South Korean society about President Moon Jae-in's actions in handling the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding the removal of Moon because of the government's handling of the pandemic.
On March 23, South Korea reported its lowest one-day infections in four weeks.

Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to isolate areas affected by the outbreak and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Although plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, high traffic activity between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
Shia pilgrim sites in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the epicenter for the spread of the virus after China in February.

Political analysts expect it to have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
"South Korea has criticised Japan's ""unclear and hostile quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced that people arriving from South Korea would be quarantined at government-appointed sites for a two-week period."
The South Korean community was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's decisions to deal with the crisis.
A number of Koreans have signed petitions calling for a criminal investigation of Moon, relying on their claim that the government had mishandled the outbreak, and his response to it as praiseworthy. Many countries have been forced to pass emergency legislation due to the impact of the pandemic.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.

The impact of the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a number of events, including supply shortages, increased use of equipment globally to fight the pandemic, over-bought purchases due to fear of the unknown, and disruption of industrial and logistical operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in supplies.
The panic buying in many localities has resulted in a shortage of essential groceries such as food, toilet paper and bottled water.
The Department of Technology had specifically warned that there would be delays in the export of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand has led to increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has caused delay of four to six months in supply of medical supplies.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned could put healthcare workers at risk.
In Australia, the epidemic offered a new opportunity for merchants known as Tycoons to sell Australian goods into China.
The operation was later banned by the Australian government as it caused a shortage of food for children in some supermarkets. The Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy and the Wuhan region was high and demand for food was high, and both sides escaped severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the hoarding and illegal trade of critical products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Industry representatives are of the view that there has not been a major drop in production in northern Italy, where there is significant agricultural production, but prices could rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, where the food pantries were temporarily empty, Chinese government officials released stockpiles of pork to ensure there was enough food for the public.
Italy also has laws that require food manufacturers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a media report published on March 16, China’s economy suffered the most severe attack in the first two months of 2020, as a result of the government’s measures to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As China's mainland is the largest economic and manufacturing hub, the virus outbreak is seen as the biggest threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agathe Demarais, of the Economic Intelligence Unit, predicts that markets will remain volatile until there is clarity on the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic fallout caused by the current pandemic would be greater than the fall caused by the SARS pandemic in 2002-2004.
According to an estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis, the world's supply chain could be affected by more than $300 billion in the next two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been hit hard by a sharp fall in oil prices due to a drop in demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 infections outside the mainland China.
On February 27, due to mounting concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, various US stock market indices, including the NASDAQ-100 (NASDAQ), the S&P 500 (S&P) index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the fastest decline since 2008, when the Dow fell 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indexes fell more than 10 percent over the weekend.
On February 28, the SCOPE value certifying company GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but extended a negative future outlook.
Stocks fell again, based on fears of the coronavirus, with the maximum fall occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there could be an economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Errian has praised the emergency measures taken by the central banks and Arasu in a timely manner.
Central financial banks are responding much more quickly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism sector has been one of the most affected sectors by travel restrictions, closures of public places including travel destinations, and government advisories against any travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the UK's regional airline, Flybe, has suffered a slump.
There has been an unprecedented impact on the aviation industry.
Several railway stations and ferry services have been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the main travel season of Sun, which is associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many events involving large gatherings, including annual New Year's festivities, were cancelled by national and regional governments, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
A number of New Year's events and tourist attractions in Beijing have been closed to avoid large crowds, including sightings of the Forbidden City and the traditional temple
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces and municipalities have extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, advising most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong closed schools and canceled New Year's celebrations until March, which raised the level of infection response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency. The retail division has been hit globally due to reduced store working hours or temporary closures.
Retailers in Europe and Latin America saw a 40% drop in sales.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This is a decline of 33<0xE2><0x80><0x93>43 per cent in sales visits in March compared to February.
Additional measures, such as increased health measures, installing thermal scanners to test the temperature of shoppers and cancelling events, were undertaken by shopping mall operators around the world, according to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, that the recession triggered by the impact of the pandemic, compared to a non-pandemic situation in which between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America were exposed to extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
China's nearly 300 million suburban migrant workers have been stranded at home in domestic provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could cause 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has left millions of Indian migrant workers (daily wage earners) unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for Universal Credit, while in Germany almost half a million companies sent their workers to government-subsidized short-term work programs known as Guzabaid.
France and the United Kingdom follow Germany's short-term work compensation program.
The current arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of institutions and individuals globally - those with permanent jobs and independent workers.
The arts and cultural sector companies have tried to keep their (often public-funded) mission to make cultural heritage accessible to society, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world will have their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed indefinitely.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through computer platforms. The cancellation of religious services, important sporting events, as well as other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technical conferences and costume shows are another recent and rapidly-spreading consequence of the spread of the disease.
The film industry has also suffered disruption. The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome during the last week of Lent's Christian penance season have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay safely at home rather than attend Sunday prayer meetings; some churches offer church services on radio, live-streaming or via television, and some offer drive-in worship services.
The Roman Catholic diocese has closed its churches and other religious organisations such as churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras have also cancelled their services following the expulsion of Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square and limited public gatherings.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas hit by the outbreak, after which the shrines were also closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own citizens from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a significant disruption in the holding of sporting events globally since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 NBA season and the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be ""rescheduled to a date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021""."
This has led a number of gamblers to move towards the Internet, and many online gambling sites have significantly increased the fees for new entrants. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups having postponed or cancelled their concert tours.
There are so many great movies like this in the franchise.
"Some artists have found new ways to produce and share content online as an alternative to traditional live-streaming, such as live-streamed concerts or creating web-based ""festival"" events for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works."
Online, numerous coronavirus-themed Internet memes have led to humor and attention-grabbing for many amid the uncertainty.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, people of Chinese and East Asian heritage have been subjected to discrimination, alien fear and racism against people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the infection is most prevalent.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (where most of the impact was in China alone) documented expressed racist feelings towards various groups of Chinese people around the world, saying that you deserved to be exposed to the virus, or that it was a fair punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have complained of being discriminated against based on their ethnic origin.
China's help came through the Internet and natively from the affected areas.
As the spread to new hotspot countries intensified, people from Italy, the first country to have COVID-19 in Europe, would also be susceptible to suspicion and racism. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to curb the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular on Twitter.
Chinese people in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other Asian countries, have reported an increase in racist abuse and attacks against them.
"US President Donald Trump's move to label the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"" has been criticised by critics as ""racism"" and ""anti-Chinese""."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sunshari.
Students from India's north-eastern states, who live in other big cities and share a border with China, have been reported to be in a tizzy over the spread of the coronavirus.
"BJP's West Bengal state committee president Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had destroyed nature and ""that's why God is taking revenge against them""."
The comments were later denounced as 'false' by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which, in China, has been exacerbated by the pandemic of alienation and racism against non-Chinese people, where foreigners have been referred to as 'foreign junkies' and targeted as 'neighbors to be dumped'.
Many newspapers have removed the practice of showing e-newsletters only to subscribers on their website to read the coronavirus-related news in a small or complete way.
Many scientific publications made available scientific papers related to the spread of the disease so that anyone could read them.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods of detecting the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The RT-PCR method of detecting RNA (RNA) of the coronavirus has confirmed the presence of the virus in the samples.
The test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (scientific) can be used for both diagnostics and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those with low levels of symptoms or who were asymptomatic.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity caused by the disease in the population can be determined from the results of this trial.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their total population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had conducted more than 3% of the country's population in the number of tests, and the number of people tested varies greatly depending on countries.
This variant could significantly affect reported mortality rates, which are likely to be assessed significantly higher in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RD-PCR) can be used to test in respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal pancreas or monkey model.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test, taken from the throat by swab, will give a reliable result only in the first week of infection.
Then the virus hides in the throat, but the lungs continue to grow there.
During the second week of testing for the victims, either through a suction catheter from the inner lining of the respiratory tract or through a cough can be used as alternative models.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed in January 2020 in Charidae, Berlin, using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and created a base of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As on 23rd January 2020, the UK had developed testing facilities as on 23rd January, 2020 and South Korean company GojinBiotech developed a PCR-based, clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerSec Corona Virus) on 28th January, 2020.
"It targets the ""E"" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the ""RdRp"" gene specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through the SARS-CoV-2 virus virus virus. It also targets the ""RdRb virus virus"" virus. In China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted through the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In earlier versions of the test kits, one of three genetic tests in Atlanta was hampered by vague results due to faulty test objects; resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Until February 28, 2020, the tests used by the two components were not determined to be reliable, and state and local laboratories were not allowed to carry out the tests until then.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization and commercial laboratories in the United States began testing it in early March 2020.
As on March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing methods across the country.
As of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics had paved the way for nationwide COVID-19 testing.
No size limits have been notified; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test system has been developed and developed by VECTOR, the State Research Centre for Toxicology and Biotechnology.
The trial was registered on February 11, 2020 by the service of the surveillance-dependent federal agency in health care. It was announced on March 12, 2020 that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test system to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that a machine would test the most in less than 3.5 hours, i.e. on March 13, 2020, for the optimal test method to perform about 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing using Abbott's M2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had previously granted similar authorisation to Holologic, Labcorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a trial that takes 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses Equipoise Enlargement technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require alternating temperature cycles, the system can deliver promising results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States, and Abbott looks forward to ramping up production to 50,000 tests per day. Specifically, a trial using a monophyletic antibody that binds to the novel coronavirus's sterile protein (my protein) is being developed in Taiwan.
"A March 2020 article commented that ""in the early stages, there is a reduced chance of detection by chest radiography, while CT [CT-computed tomography] results may show even before the onset of symptoms."""
Common features in CT include bi-polar ground-mirror opacity with external, asymmetric and rear distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural edema, trachea, and hardening of the respiratory tract develop.
A study comparing the PCR to the CT at the point of onset of the current epidemic in Wuhan showed that although many of the graphical features of the CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, the CT was significantly more specific than the PCR, suggesting more obvious effects.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""the use of the CT method should not be used as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 or as a first-line test""."
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IGM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in persons having 7 or more days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and also for public surveillance. The assessment can be done in Central Laboratories (CLT) or at Care Testing Points (PoCT-BOCT).
These assessments can be carried out by high-efficiency automated systems in many clinical laboratories, but their availability depends on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT test, a blood sample is usually taken by a small hole in the skin.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 26, 2020 released the names of 29 companies that have been certified as having the ability to distribute their antibody tests as they provide information to the agency on demand.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test under emergency use authorisation has been approved by the FDA. The Euroimune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics Institutes that manufacture testing kits for IgG and IgA antibodies that work against the virus from blood samples.
With the ability to test several hundred samples within a few hours, the virus will deliver results much faster than the typical PCR assessment of RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection. They found in early April that none of the antibody testing kits purchased by the UK were suitable for use.
"Hong Kong has set up a pilot program to allow suspected patients to stay at home, ""a sample tube delivered by the emergency department to the patient"", return it a short time later, and receive a test result. The British NHS is running a pilot pilot program to test suspected patients for COVID-19 using the virus at home, thus avoiding the risk of infection or infection if the patient comes to the hospital."
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea carry out more rapid, comprehensive tests than any other country. The mobile system has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day and 10,700 tests were carried out last week, the German-based Association of National Law Insurance Physicians said on March 2.
When a doctor orders an examination, the costs are borne by the health insurance company.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests were being conducted in several major cities, as was the case with vehicles.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany is not known, as only the number of confirmed test results is reported.
"In the first laboratory study, up to the 12/2020 calendar week, 33,491 samples of 483,295 tested, including 12/2020 week, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (as ""Spider-Ibacterium 6.9%"": ""Spider-to-Bubble") as early as 2020."
Sample methods show that if the testing developed in 5 days under the direct supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian had not been implemented, the number of patients in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of tackling quarantine would have doubled.
Hua-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have systematically followed the operations of the Wuhan laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, the daily performance was a total of 50,000 tests per day. Open source, multiplex designs released by origami assessments have been released, which can test 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 evaluations. These uniform designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, the shortage of testing material and the lack of adequate stockpiles had prevented mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
This has led some creators to explore the protocol for preparing a model that warms samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for further testing to release RNA genomes. The UAE is testing its population at a higher rate than other countries, and is on track to test the majority of its population by March 31.
"This is done through the purchase of a drive-through facility and a high-performance lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on the ""Hu-Yan"" emergency diagnostic labs in China) depending on the population."
Completed in 14 days, the lab will have the capacity to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and will be the first of its kind globally outside China.
Different testing procedures targeting different parts of the coronavirus genome profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German recipe for producing tools for sending to low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own tools.
The German follow-up process was released on 17 January 2020; testing was delayed in the United States as the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was not available until 28 January. The U.S. and China had some problems in the initial stages of the outbreak, so the countries and Australia could not provide enough testing and requirements to meet the recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's extensive testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private-sector laboratories, was built by the South Korean government over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was to speed up testing programs. Due to the increasing virus outbreak and the need to scale-up testing, hundreds of thousands of tests were pending in private laboratories in the United States, and availability of fluoride and chemical test materials was difficult.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
"In the United States, the testing kits developed by the CDC had ""disadvantages""; the government later lifted bureaucratic sanctions that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the testing kits from Chinese company Shenzhen BioEase Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but the results were found to be false."
The company explained that the incorrect results may have been the result of mistakes in the collection of samples or the correct use of the tools.
Spain's ministry said it would withdraw the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen BioEC. The Czech Republic gave the wrong results with 80% of the kits purchased from China. Slovakia's 1.2 million test kits purchased from China were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested throwing them into the Danube, saying the test kits Turkey bought from China had a 'high error rate' and were 'unable to put them into use,' Turkish Health Ministry Atte Cara said. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced they were unfit for use in early April 2020.
The process of testing and tracing persons who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who have come in contact with them has yielded positive results
Researchers in the Italian city of Woo, where the first COVID-19 death was reported, conducted two rounds of tests in a space of about ten days at the site of a population of about 3,400.
Half of the confirmed cases showed no symptoms and all the confirmed patients were isolated.
As travel to the municipal council was banned, it completely eliminated new infections.
Despite the absence of stringent restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the outbreak of the 2020 coronavirus in Singapore has spread at a much slower pace than in other developed countries due to the severity of contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising its residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holiday break on March 23.
Many countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have followed a low-intensity lockdown while managing the spread of the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
One statistical study found that compared to the death toll, the countries tested the most had the lowest death rates as these countries were able to detect mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries without optimal testing facilities and national laboratories with little experience in COVID-19 send their first five confirmed samples to one of the 16 WHO-recommended laboratories for confirmation.
Of the 16 recommended laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the following chart, the column ""confirmed based on tests %"" is affected by a country's policy on testing."
While all others are equal, the number of confirmed cases in the country testing only those admitted to hospitals will be higher than the country testing all citizens, irrespective of whether they have symptoms or not.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of removing soil, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from one's hands.
"Continuous handwashing with soap during certain ""critical moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera. these are transmitted through feces and orally."
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold. For example, people who do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) are more likely to contract the disease.
Five important moments that one must wash hands with soap on a daily basis: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s bottom or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and when handling uncooked meat, fish or poultry meat.
If water and soap are not available, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands with:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the toilet.
Wash your face after coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
After touching the animal's feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical practice.
Hand washing before providing medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from germs (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is very important for people dealing with or working with food in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
Reducing the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study suggests that improved handwashing routines may help children under the age of five achieve smaller heights.
In developing countries, the introduction of simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap can reduce childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhoeal episodes by as much as one-third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A decrease of 48% in diarrhoeal episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), like automated behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Asthma is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet as a routine can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other sanitation initiatives as part of Water, Sanitation and Sanitation (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing protects against the evils that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
One minor harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A Danish study conducted in 2012 found that excessive handwashing can lead to an itchy, uneven skin condition known as itchy shingles or dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Very often handwashing is also seen as a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD.
There are five critical times to wash hands with soap to reduce fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after using the bathroom (drying, defecation), after cleaning a baby’s bottom (changing clothes), before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and/or handing over cooked meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other cases where proper hand washing technique should be adopted to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or nosebleeds; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. In a 2014 study, Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States at 77%; and China had the lowest at 23%. Washing with soap is one of the most important practices in developing countries.
The "Essential Health Plan" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example measure to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to handwashing with soap daily and flossing daily are the focus of this national programme.
It has been very successful in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or laundry products to the water.
The main function of soaps and washing powders is to reduce the blockages of the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because the fats and proteins that are components of organic soil do not readily dissolve in water.
However, purification is aided by adequate flow of water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria derived from previous applications.
A small number of studies that have tracked the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible because the bacteria is washed away by the foam.
The CDC still states that “liquid soap with hands-free controls is preferable .
Antibacterial soaps are highly encouraged for the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that antimicrobial-resistant organisms are selective in nature due to the use of prescribed disinfectants or disinfectants.
However, anti-bacterial soaps contain typical anti-bacterial factors such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of anti-vibration strains.
So even though antimicrobial strains are not selected in antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to peripheral processors and skin-protection factor, sophisticated formulations include a pH regulator for acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid) as well as anti-bacterial drugs, as well as anti-oxidants for bacteria, as well as anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as benzoic acid from the university of microorganisms.
The hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at relieving dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microorganisms in the hands.
Hand sanitisers or hand sanitizers are water-based non-hand hygiene products.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene factors (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a dense substance such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to form a gel or a moisturiser such as glycerin for easy use and to reduce the alcohol drying effect.
The addition of dilute hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Refineries with a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol-based cleansers kill bacteria, co-morbid bacteria (MRSA and VRE) tuberculosis, and some pathogens (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubbing cleansers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria in the hands within 30 seconds of use (3.5 concentration reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and act against bacteria by 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria in the 1 minute of use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer fluids are completely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type of viruses, a common cause of infectious gastritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rubbing should be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The hinges and ends of all fingers are rubbed on the front and back of both hands for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizers, especially if hands are found to be contaminated.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their simplicity and rapid clearing operations against microorganisms; however, they should not act as a substitute for proper handwashing if soap and water are not available
If irritants and/or skin moisturisers are not added to the formula, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are often used to treat dry skin.
The effect of alcohol drying can be minimized or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other antifungal drugs to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness, rather than soaps or anti-microbial washing powder.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or excessive skin resistance to alcohol or a rarely occurring hand itching through combinations in alcohol.
One attraction is the low risk of triggering contact dermatitis, which is irritating compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-watering factors do not cleanse the organic matter in the hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers, like soap and water, are not effective in preventing the spread of many germs because the germs still remain on the hands.
The non-alcoholic hand sanitiser performance is heavily dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically mainly alcohol and alcohol hand rubbing has been less effective.
More recently, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions, unlike alcohol that has been shown to decrease performance due to repeated use, composition plans using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a continuous and overall anti-microbial activity after use.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using only water, but may be less efficient than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may exacerbate the disease rather than reduce the spread.
Like soap, ash also acts as a disinfecting agent because when it comes in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap was not available.
The handwashing method recommended by the American Centers for Disease Control includes the following steps:
Wash your hands in hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended, as standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap than when using water alone.
Press for at least 20 seconds.
Compression creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and long-term rubbing removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Hand washing in the role can be re-polluted.
Let it dry with a clean towel or allow it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily infected. The areas that are usually missed without proper cleaning are under the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and prickly nail polishes can give space to microorganisms.
Moisturizing ointment is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which increases the risk of infection transmission.
Various cost-effective options for handwashing can be arranged where there is no tap-water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from an appropriate drain from a hanging flowerpot or scaffold and/or using ash if they are developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions.
"A dippy-tape is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended sloping with a rope, and consisted of a foot-operated lever and soap tumble to pour a small amount of water over the hands."
Hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about how to dry in public toilets.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, which compared the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot-air dryer, the number of bacteria increases by 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Hand drying with an e-air dryer increases the number of bacteria by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
The total number of bacteria in the fingernails after washing hands with paper towels decreased by an average of 76% and in the palms by 77%. The scientists conducted several experiments to see if other users in the bathroom and the environment of the room were more likely to cross-infection as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h;400 mph), is capable of blowing micro-organisms out of the hands and instrument and is likely to pollute other toilet users and the toilet environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer can spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show a significant amount of micro-organism transmission, and a 2005 study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after drying the hands:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared against drying with paper towels.
Hand washing is an alternative to using hand sanitizing wipes in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
It was made mandatory in 1846 after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness of hand washing in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water or gel for at least 15 seconds and rub each area of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other.
If there are debris under the fingernails, a brush can be used in a brush to remove it.
Since germs can be present in the water in the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towels should be used to stop the water (and, if necessary, to open the exit door).
This prevents re-pollination of the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health-care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("viruses") and prevent them from spreading.
The New England Journal of Medicine says that in most medical environments where handwashing is unacceptable, a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching patients, causing the spread of germs.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of urinary tract infections related to urinary tract tract infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a study demonstrating quality handwashing and hand rubbing in health care fields.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines have been published on the organization's website for public comments.
An appropriate study was conducted by Whitby Ed Al.
Commercial organizations can measure and assess hand hygiene if they require an explanation of the extent of compliance with the regulation.
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are ""five moments"" to wash hands:"
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to the onset of the pandemic, and
After the patient’s care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals ("drug" or "antimicrobial" soaps) to the hand washing liquid provides the ability to destroy germs.
Such disinfection action may be preferred before surgery or in systems where antibiotic-resistant organisms are more common. A surgery requires having a water tap that can <0xE2><0x80><0x98>wipe’ one’s hands, without touching, open and close. It is necessary to wash one’s hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washes, another piece of styral for drying hands after washing, and a swab for cleaning.
All arms should be removed.
This procedure involves washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>6 minutes.
There is no need for long scrub times (10 minutes).
The water in the forelegs should be prevented from getting back into the hands when washing.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use hand sanitizer.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit was obtained from hand washing from the first 20% of washes, and the lowest added benefit was obtained when the hand washing frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with plain soap is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection transmitted through food as compared to washing with anti-bacterial soap. Washing with an alcohol-based solution is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection. Washing with an anti-bacterial solution for 30 seconds is more effective than hand washing with anti-bacterial soap, compared to hand-washing with an alcohol solution which is more anti-bacterial disinfection.
Soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium hard seed from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings include advising staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand washing, and providing staff with written and verbal reminders.
There is a need for further research into which of these interventions would be most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as cost-effective, an essential tool for achieving good health, and a good feed.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve global hand-washing behaviours.
For example, in most of Africa's rural areas, handwashing taps near private or public toilets are scarce despite the cheap possibilities of creating handwashing spaces.
However, less handwashing may be more common than soap or water.
The promotion and consultation of handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change of people.
This is important for monitoring and evaluation to work better.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches to increasing hand washing at LMICs were effective, while campaigns via social media were less effective. One example is UNICEF’s “three-star approach,” a program to promote hand washing in schools, which encourages schools to take measures that, among other health needs, encourage students to take less simple, more cost-effective measures to ensure they don’t wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three star status at the end.
The creation of hand-washing stations is part of hand-washing promotional campaigns undertaken to reduce diseases and child mortality.
Another example of an awareness-raising campaign trying to achieve behavioural change is Global Handwashing Day. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have suggested that the overall cost effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with dalits has been averted.
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly less expensive than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers born or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized by two pioneers of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English as the ""founder of modern nursing""."
Most people at the time believed that infections were caused by a foul smell called miasmas.
After the foodborne illness and health-related infections in 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of the disease.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters on ""proper hand washing techniques"" have been hung near handwashing tanks in public toilets, office buildings and airports in Germany."
"The phrase ""washing one's hands"" from something means declaring one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or share in complicity."
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to impale Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands hysterically as she tries to purge a fictitious stain, which makes her represent a sense of guilt over the crimes she committed and the crimes that prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after recalling or contemplating acts of indiscipline, and more respect for handwashing tools.
Those who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, the use of water, but no soap for hand washing, is part of the ritual hand washing that is featured in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith in Judaism, Hinduism, Devila, and Nedilil<0xC3><0xA1>th Ya'adaim, Laobo in Christianity, which is practiced in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam make it mandatory to wash your hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam make it mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Workplace Hazard Controls for COVID-19
Employing occupational safety and health protocols for risk control for the prevention of COVID-19 is the workplace risk controls based on COVID-19.
Workplace and workplace risk controls are set up based on factors such as workplace and workplace conditions, sources of risk of infection, community severity and risk factors of individual workers who are likely to be affected by COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk tasks have minimal work-related interactions with the public and other co-workers. In this case, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, following proper respiratory practices, maintaining cleanliness in the work environment, and continuing disinfection.
Medium-term risk includes tasks that require frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients or people who are likely to be affected by the current outbreak.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, work environments with a high population density, and some high-volume retail organizations.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the risk controls for the group include better ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing inhibitors and wearable personal protective equipment in case of contact with a COVID-19 infected person.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is of the view that health and morgue workers facing known or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk of contracting the infection. Employees who are exposed to the risk of developing atherosclerosis or of collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 infected person are placed at a high risk of transmission.
Hazards include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilated rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment suitable for working conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not return to work due to health issues, the need to care for others, or the fear of infection.
Forms of business may change as a result of changes in the means of obtaining the goods and materials requested (such as buying goods during off-peak hours or receiving them through supply or drive-through services).
Finally, the export of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be hampered. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to guide safety measures.
The programs specify the risk levels associated with various workstations and work-related tasks, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for the elderly or individual workers with chronic epilepsy.
They outline the controls needed to avoid risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease-dependent preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or advisory recommendations.
Targets for responding to the outbreak include reducing the spread among employees, protecting those at high risk for serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the adverse effects on other firms in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the responses received in the community in which the business is located.
The sequencing of risk controls is a framework widely used in the fields of occupational safety and health to group risk controls through performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, engineering-based controls, followed by administrative controls and finally the use of personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Engineering regulations include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying solely on the behavior of employees, which is a cost-effective and easy-to-implement solution.
Administrative restrictions are the changes in the procedures or policies to be followed by the employee or the chair.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain risk factors.
PPEs should be selected based on the potential risk to employees, suitably fitted (e.g., respirators), uniformly worn, inspected and maintained from time to time and replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored, or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk hazardous work has minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers.
Frequent and regular hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory regulations including covering their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, installing tissue and dustbins, remote working if necessary or managing intermittent working hours, recommending basic disinfection of all workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and regular cleaning of work environments.
Immediate identification and isolation of persons likely to be infected at a workplace is an important step towards protecting workers, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms stay at home until they have fever, flu symptoms, and no other symptoms, after they have not taken fever-reducing or other symptom-altering drugs for at least 24 hours. Medical leave policies are flexible and allow employees to stay at home to keep employees informed about the policy, to care for a sick family member.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work that requires frequent or close contact with people who are at risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission around the commercial area, known or suspected, COVID-19 patients or individuals who have recently traveled internationally to an area where COVID-19 transmission is widespread, such as a six-foot (1.8 m) distance between frequent or near contact with work at medium risk.
These include workers who interact with the general public in schools, over-populated work environments, and over-crowded retail settings. These include employees who have been exposed to COVID-19, employees who have been exposed to a wide range of COVID-19 outbreaks, employees who are trained to operate in high-risk environments, employees to train for COVID-19, personnel to provide emergency response training, and personnel to provide personal protective equipment, installation of high-efficiency air filters and ventilation systems, installation of high-opts, and customer service.
Workers with this condition rarely need a respirator.
If a person is sick on a flight, the formal restrictions to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, appointing a team member to serve the sick person, and providing a mask to the sick person or telling the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with dishwashes while coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear single-use medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or surfaces where there is a possibility of infection. Additional personal protective equipment should also be worn if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other items to be removed should be stored and disposed of in a biological hazard bag, and then the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Hazard controls to be carried out on commercial vessels, including luxury ships and other passenger vessels, include postponing travel if sick and self-isolation and providing information to the ship’s medical center immediately.
Generally, a medical checkup should be performed on the isolated person in the room. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends short-term closure of the area to clean or disinfect if the infected person has been in the school building, regardless of community transmission status.
At a time of moderate or low social spread, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as field trips, canceling meetings and cancelling large gatherings such as physical education or singing group classes or dining out at a restaurant, increasing the gap between tables, intermittent arrival and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there is substantial spread at the local community level, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures can be considered a strategy. For law enforcement personnel who carry out daily routine activities, the level of immediate health risk is low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Law enforcement officials who come into contact with people confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are also recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during seizure, the work board and clothing should be cleaned and disinfected with a household cleaning sprayer or wipe, and general procedures for assigning and removing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used should be followed.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies certain health and morgue workers as belonging to a high or very high risk category.
Health care, support, laboratory services providers and medical transport workers are among those at high risk of infection for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
It is considered a high-risk condition if the staff is involved in the collection or handling of samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Stages of atherosclerosis include tubal implantation into the trachea, cough-inducing procedures, pulmonary intravenous examination, some dental procedures, and sample collection by means of studies or piercings.
In high-exposure morgue work, including workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these become very high-exposure risk if the autopsy is performed. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
The provision of special negative pressure ventilation in some health and morgue settings may be optimal.
Biosafety Level 3 precautions should be followed and samples should be handled.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients should be cared for in isolated waiting areas, depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 patients. Ospreys (OPE) except for those who serve less than 6 feet apart from those who are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are suspected to be infected.
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes eligibility-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide greater protection and make it easier for staff to wear. WHO does not recommend full-wearing, as COVID-19 is not a respiratory disease and does not spread through body fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that masks be given only to personnel working at the entry point of entry into or exiting the country during surgery.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or mask, gown and gloves for those who collect, care for or carry respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures.
In cases of anaemia, N95 (N95) or FFP2 respirators are used instead of surgical masks.
Due to insufficient global supply of personal protective equipment, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room with the COVID-19 patient, using only personal protective equipment required for specific work, while maintaining many patients with the same diagnosis and minimizing the need for continued use of the same respiratory apparatus without removing, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment.

Sending date/ time: 14-March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: None of the rights are protected.
We are in a unique situation this year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness of humanity on a global scale and the responsibilities we all have to shoulder towards each other.
We don't have a model for these challenges, but we know that the best response is to have global empathy, cooperation and community building at the core of this institution.
The friendship and concern we have seen among all of our colleagues through email, calls and chats is remarkable testimony to the fact that we are lucky to work with amazing people.
I couldn't be more proud and grateful to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me a compliment about our work.
He reminded me how important it is for the world to look to Wikipedia for information, and that maintaining these important resources online is a powerful sign.
Your work makes this possible, no matter what we do to keep sites up-to-date, or pay our colleagues, or help our communities stay safe.
Technology is more important to the world today than ever before.
This is the moment not only of what we do, but of how we do it in a way that makes a meaningful impact on the world.
Considering the importance of this task and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work together from this week onwards.
Changes in our work and activities.
As Robin mentioned earlier, C-Groups met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what we think is the appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to sustain the company at this point in time.
We wanted to get rid of the stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce weight, do it.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectation would be 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We don't announce a holiday - if you want to work longer than you normally would, this task will use you to its fullest.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and you may want to support your loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, but your well-being is our priority.
We don't control your time.
If you're sick, don't go to work.
We have to say it, but we have to say it.
No medical leave or PTO required <0xE2><0x80><0x93> help your team edit calendars and action plans to make sure they are focused on key areas of the job and send information to your manager.
(If you have been confirmed positive for COVID-19, please contact Brian on T&C Ops, which will help T&Cs provide you with the support you need and ensure you get the proper attention of your state administration.)
Full payment will be made to hourly employees.
As we said earlier, we are re-affirming our commitment to pay our contractors and hourly workers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
All employees will be paid based on normal working hours.
This includes being sick and not being able to work because of it.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many of us use work as a way to relieve the stress of the world around us.
The work we do, especially during times like these, can bring unexpected results.
Again, it's all about your own safety.
Our request is that you contact your manager so that we can know what to expect and then be able to adjust accordingly.
Some work is required.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and the fundraising teams (among others) are doing important work requiring additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus on supporting what is essential to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we're all going to focus on the most essential projects right now.
After that, the delay will be less.
"We don't plan to serve as ""double time to catch up with what was lost"" once the pandemic is over."
There is no need to work extra hours to meet an out-of-date deadline.
We accept that the environment has changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What is ABP (APP <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to the new regime and expectations of daily working hours, we propose to revise the timelines for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our aim is to propose an expansion of the 2019-2020 plan, which while accommodating those who need or want a reduced schedule, gives employees more time over the next few weeks to plan prioritizing important work, self-care and caring for loved ones.
The extension of this deadline drastically reduces the current planning workload and stress on the entire organization.
We'll be back next week with an update on the progress of the project, and we'll get back to you with our team members.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office status, chance of infection and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues had been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we cleaned all surfaces in the San Francisco office with an anti-microbial cleaning team to disinfect them.
They used a mix of hospital-grade virus-prevention to disinfect surfaces, homeroom access to our site, and elevators.
The building maintains a moral or legal obligation to use products that ensure the safety of the residents.
When we return to work, we are relieved to know that the office will be ready for us.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC staff.
As of last week, our DC office had switched to a fully remote system in accordance with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York City are aware, we are also discussing leasing out a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues knew this was a fix and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If long-term sessions are needed, explore how they can be divided into sessions that have several days.
Define the need for the meeting clearly, create an action plan, and send in the things that need to be studied in advance.
Set the video to default using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live syncing and connection.
One to properly organize front-end meetings, one to keep track of questions that arise during the chat and one to track the speaker list and to help take notes (or collectively take notes).
Send an e-mail if you need technical assistance.
Take advantage of the discounts offered to you.
Join the <0x23>RemotivationalChannel at Slack to talk to your peers about distributed work
To support the increased level of distributed work across the Institute, the HRO has been taking steps to take up a webinar based ergonomic guidance.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the World Health Organization (WHO) announces the end of the pandemic.
We let them know that depending on our request for cancellations and other restrictions we understand that they are unable to complete the grant activities they have accepted and that no one will be penalized for any delay or deviation in reaching those goals.
We'll be following further guidance on Wikimania and other regional and themed social conferences this week.
For the global community, it can be seen that this disruption has generally created distress rather than help with clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, and others.
CRT is working on setting up a page on Meta-Wiki to help the community keep track of impact and follow our communications, taking into account the future.
Continuing awareness of COVID-19 related issues
On the following Thursday, at 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, we will send an invitation to your calendars to participate in a special staff meeting.
You can use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We stand with you in this matter and are ready to assist you in any way possible.
In the meantime, you can get some information from this email and find all essential COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages from time to time to ensure that all information is available in one place.
We also maintain regular communication with employees in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major task force or an insurance challenge or need assistance, please do not hesitate to notify CRT or work together.
We are here to offer support and assistance.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email HR International Global Operations (HR International Global Operations) Director Brian Judden.
None of these changes should be seen as an act of abdication of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition that at this time, we will have to adapt our work and duties in a way that has never been done before.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need for our movement, and provide them with the service the world looks forward to.
We are waiting for the work to be done when the time comes.
For now, it's time to be supportive of each other and focus on the important work that's to come in a few weeks or possibly months.
We need all of you to fulfil it, so we want you to participate as best you can in times of need, and now we want you to take care of yourself and your family properly.
Now, please - wash your hands, don't touch your face!

B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2-ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surfaces (biological membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE-2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing ang-1-7. This makes it a promising target drug for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE-2 also acts as an entry point in cells for some coronary pathogens.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an enzyme with zinc metal located on the surface of the intramuscular and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptides M2 site and the C-terminal collector's kidney amino acid conduction site.
ACE2 is the first type of membrane protein to cross once. Its enzymatically active part is exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The peripheral domain of ACE2 is broken down from the membrane domain by another enzyme called shetase, resulting in soluble protein being mixed into the bloodstream and eventually excreted through urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme - 2 is present in most organs: Angiotensin-converting enzyme - 2 is mainly linked to the cell membrane of the second type of pulmonary alveolar cells, the endothocytes of the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the artery and vein, and the soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
ACE2 messenger ribonucleotide (mRNA) exposure is found in the cerebral cortex, linear, cerebral, cerebral and spinal cord region.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstrict angiotensin II.
ACE 2 splits carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and releases it in the vasodilator hydro-Hrog-Hle-Val-Vy (1-7), (H-Ap-Hle-Hle-Val-Py)
[Des-ARG9]-ACE2 may also cause cleavage between several other peptides, such as bradykinin, aplin, neurotensin, dinoorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6.A19, which ensures the distribution of proteins and large molecules in cells. This has been confirmed in the rare type of amino acid metabolizing disease, heartnap disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2, reacts with the HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes SARS-CoV-), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) for certain coronaviruses.
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and the spike S1 protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry step requires the proliferation of S protein by TMBRSS2, the supplier’s protein destroyer, and is currently being studied to see if suppression can be a treatment option. Because of this, the hypothesis is that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help in fighting the infection.
However, many professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE suppression and ARB treatment.
"A systematic study and mutation-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls""."
Among patients at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors has also reduced the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors reduces pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia.'
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhaACE2) is considered a new treatment for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary blood circulation and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory syndrome induced by fatty coagulation.
The half-life of rhaACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and takes 30 minutes to start functioning and an additional 24 hours (period of activity).
A number of findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug in those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or angiotensin II-induced angiotensin-induced diseases.
"B'COVID-19 Apps is a mobile software application designed to help in the detection of contacts during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic i.e., the process of identifying persons (""contacts"") who may have come in contact with an infected person."
In some territories and jurisdictions, a large number of apps have been developed or proposed with official government support.
Several frameworks for developing contact tracing applications have been improved.
In particular, privacy concerns have been raised about systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate such Bluetooth-based apps into their Android and iOS operating systems to support the functionality directly.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 victims.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called Trace Together is used.
"The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released free of charge and will be handed over to the government. West Macedonia launched the Bluetooth-based app ""Stop Corona!"", which detects the exposure of infected individuals and provides quick information to health authorities."
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be released within a few weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s Trastucketer app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19-infected patients living in Moscow, designed to keep those infected from leaving home.
Rose Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and its efficacy if the taking of the app is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of false or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only ""official"" or reputable companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Proponents of the right to privacy expressed concern over the impact of mass surveillance using the Corona Virus App, particularly on whether the surveillance infrastructure created to tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat is under control.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The companies announced eight conditions on government schemes:
There must be a legal, necessary, and proper proportion of surveillance;
Extensions of monitoring and monitoring shall be subject to Sunset Regulations;
The use of the data should be for COVID-19 purposes only.
Data protection and anonymity should be protected and should be protected on the basis of evidence;
Increase in discrimination and marginalization should be avoided through digital surveillance;
The sharing of data with third parties must be defined in the law;
The citizens shall have the right to defend themselves against and to face the scourge;
"A meaningful participation of all ""related stakeholders"", including public health professionals and marginalized groups, would be required. the German Gaias Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter One Krensen) (RSF) also issued checklists."
The proposed Google/Apple project intends to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems if the tracking mechanism is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance is recognized.
Network-based solutions that can access source location data have significant potential for having privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location information; many have developed systems that protect privacy that only use central servers for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to identify people who may have had contact with an infected person.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and aggregates this information and sends it to vulnerable individuals via SMS.
This information is used to alert potential contacts, and the government has also made location information available to the public, thanks to the massive changes in information privacy laws since the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made available to the public via a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considered to be using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Contact tracing to protect privacy is a well-established concept that has been around in the research literature since 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on friendly-privacy solutions, such as sending a user's proximity statuses to other handsets using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a concerted effort, which consists of centralized and decentralized approaches, which is not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protecting proximity (DB-BBD/DB-3D), temporary contact numbers (TCN, FKAA contact event numbers, CEN) and mobile tracking (TCN, FKA contact case numbers, CEN privacy algorithm).
In these protocols, the identifiable personal data, never leaves the device, and all matching occurs within the device itself.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing Safepaths, a platform for the use of techniques to protect privacy while collecting and using location or route intercept information to track the spread of COVID-19.
"This is based on research published in March 2020 by White Paper ""Research by Aps Khan Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Pandemic""."
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share their sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, the Global DCN-Council was established with the aim of minimizing some of the overlap between groupings, with a single approach and often overlapping protocols, and enabling the global platform to detect and alert applications and achieve widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore made public its official government app, BlueTrace Protocol, which is used by
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an effort to identify the contact person based on a mix of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also released the specifications of the major technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be released in three stages:
The tools have been developed to help governments develop a possible contact tracing app in order to protect against the official secret coronavirus.
To integrate this functionality directly with iOS, Android Google, and Apple, it plans to first address the issue of system distribution through operating system updates and then remove it in the same way if the threat passes.
Drug reassignment (also known as drug reuptake, re-deployment, or treatment shift) is the repurposing of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than originally developed.
It is part of scientific research and is currently being used to continuously improve safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of lymph to get rid of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The inspection of those binding sites provides a reasonable plan to develop effective antiviral vaccines against COVID-19 protein.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papain-like proteins, RNA-based ribonuclease (RNA - RNA) polymerase, helicase, S protein and ATP ribophosphate.
Husain AA, et al. studied a number of study compounds and then optimized their basic similarity with approved drugs with the highest approval. This is carried out to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to be prescribed in a clinical study format.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug. It is also used against some autoimmune diseases.

It is not safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Galetra) concluded that a combination of antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, ""have shown no benefit""."
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV from reacting by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to replace drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. Criticisms are within the scientific community about directing evidence for the reuse of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS diseases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international coordinated trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had peripherally antiviral activity against several phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and CoVs.
Creating resistance through complex mutations in viral prevention therapy can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to drug resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one for those with moderate disease, and the other for those with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C, which is administered intravenously to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one non-restrictive (Italy).

The Beta A COVID-19 vaccine is a pre-determined vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was not expected to be available within 18 months.
In the first phase of the trial, five vaccines were tested.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
There was a severe disease outbreak in 2020 that led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are using already published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI noted that speed, productivity, large-scale implementation and universal access are mandatory for vaccine development initiatives.
In April, CEPI scientists said there were 10 different technology research platforms and progress on them at the beginning of 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The major objectives of Phase I safety studies are as follows:
Emerald (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Study: Moderna, messenger ribovirus (mRNA - mRNA-1273)
Bacterial Transmitter (Phase I Developer and Vaccinator: Cansino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Transmitter)
As announced by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (according to Milken’s company 79), and 37 others making announcements, but public information is only available in small quantities (deemed to be planning or being designed).
The Phase I-II trial, which determines the most accurate, effective doses, is usually randomized, doping-controlled, and conducts preliminary safety and immunological testing at multiple sites.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the trial efficacy of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while also monitoring the adverse effects of the dose given at optimal levels.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 are yet to be involved in the human evaluation study (and are still in ""preclinical"" research)."

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities, along with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, pooled resources from IBM to access supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as nonspecific effects.
This means that they can benefit from prevention.
Further random testing in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines in progress are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess vaccine efficacy using CoVID-19-specific animal models such as transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human animals indicates the need for biosafety level 3 control measures and international coordination to deal with live pathogens to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or safety vaccine that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans for SARS.

While MERS was widely practiced, it is believed that existing SARS research could provide an effective template for developing vaccines and treatment modalities against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more trials are underway, all of which are virologic-infectious vaccines, two adenovirus-infectious-infectious (ChAdOx1-merz, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-infigm.
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories that state that the virus behind COVID-19 has been detected and a vaccine is already in place.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from the first symptoms to infection, but it can range from two days to fourteen days.
While most infections produce mild symptoms, there is some improvement in viral pneumonia and polycystic ovary syndrome.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted through close contact with humans, usually through droplets emitted during coughing, sneezing, or speech.
These tumours develop as they exhale and usually fall on the ground or surface rather than being infected for long distances.
Touching an infected surface can cause infection of the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of symptoms, although it is possible to spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal puncture.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the WHO's six regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty getting up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In the beginning, there were only a few cases of the disease in China with chest tightness and bruising.
In some patients, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
This period is called the incubation period (the period during which symptoms appear).
The incubation period of COVID-19 (the incubation period of symptoms) is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop the disease within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is still not fully known, and preliminary evidence suggests that they may also contribute to disease transmission.
The proportion of people who are infected but do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) saying that 20% of confirmed patients had no symptoms when they were hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began adding asymptomatic cases to its daily caseload on April 1; of the 166 infections that occurred that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the cobra and the saliva carry large amounts of viruses.
By the word of the Lord, they are more than words that are spoken.
Studies have shown that even when both mouthpieces are closed, the saliva can travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The National Academy of Sciences has suggested that while the virus is not commonly transmitted, bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hall outside people’s rooms provided positive samples for viral RNA.
Respiratory glands can be sprayed through certain medical procedures, such as intravenous inhalation and cardiopulmonary inhalation (CPR), resulting in the spread of toxins into the air.
While there are concerns that it may spread via faeces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
While it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that one usually infects two to three people, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours to several days.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive for up to three days on cardboard, up to a day on plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this will vary depending on the temperature and humidity.
Soap and laundry powder are also useful if used correctly; soap products degrade the virus's fat protective layer, deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken two days after hospitalization, on average.
For five of the six patients, the first sample showed more viruses, and the sixth patient showed more viruses on the second day of being tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel highly acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus first isolated in Wuhan in three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory cluster disease.
All aspects of CoVs in nature also occur in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The organs most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus approaches host cells via an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a unique extremity glycoprotein called a "peplomer" to interact with ACE2 and enter another cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized patients were diagnosed with acute heart disease, and it is often seen in severe illnesses.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to organ anti-inflammatory activity and immune system disorders during disease progression, but severe heart attack may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are most expressed in the heart and are involved in the heart function.
Patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 infection have been found to be more prone to blood clots (thrombosis of 31%) in the vessels and blood clots in the veins (Venus thrombopopolis of 25%), and are more likely to be associated with poor prognosis of venereal disease.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an induction bias to the ACE2-exposed epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of organ-high inflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF, which secretes T-cells, has been shown to be associated with IL-6 inflammatory and acute lung disease secreting single cells in COVID-19 patients.
The post-mortem examination has recorded intrusions in lymphatic cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method for testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Usually the test is done on respiratory samples obtained by a nesophryngeal puncture; however, a nasal puncture or a monkey sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and the results have a small immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and release a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect existing infections and whether a person has had infection in the past) were in progress, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experience shows that the accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, suggested methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bipolar floor-glass opacity with external, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common in early infection.
Plasma dominance, paralyzing trachea (difficulty thickening of the epidermis with variable trachea fillers), and may be strengthened during the progression of the disease.
There is some information available about microscopic lesions and the pathology of COVID-19.
The major pathological findings of the post-mortem are:
Physical examination: Pulmonary embolism, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary inflammation
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild Pneumonia: Pulmonary inflammation, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large variety of pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic intrusion and multinuclear giant cell formation
Acute pneumonia: Transmissible alveolar damage (DAD) with transmissible alveolar lesions.
Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe blood oxygen deficiency (DAD) is the cause.
Healing pneumonia: Structure of alveolar cavities and lesions in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Widespread hemorrhagic clot (DIC); white blood cell increase reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a dishwasher when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no dish is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
To limit the spread of asymptomatic individuals, the CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Social distancing guidelines also require people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No medicine is effective in preventing COVID-19. The key to managing COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the pandemic as a vaccine cannot be expected until 2021, though as early as possible, which is called <0xE2><0x80><0x98>flattening the curve’.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""."
Glycerin is added as a preservative.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, biofeedback, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECMO), was used to solve the problem of respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supplementary therapies may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for taking care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care professionals and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource called the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be mandatorily taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially during practices where health systems can issue aphrodisiacs, such as pipe fittings or using a hand-operated respirator.
The CDC recommends placing a person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to the use of standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions for the healthcare sector caring for those with COVID-19. The CDC also provides guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended Tools: PPE tops, respirators or face masks, eye protections, and medical gloves. Respirators (instead of masks) are recommended if available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have been approved by the FDA.
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed against specific biological agents as an unauthorized use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using masks or, last but not least, home-made masks.
Most COVID-19 patients do not have a severe enough condition to require artificial respiration or replacements, but a certain percentage do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory distress is being seriously studied for people in the hospital with some evidence that intubation with high-flow nasal cannula or two-stage positive airway pressure may be avoided.
It is not known whether these two drugs have the same effect on patients.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation when available, as this technology limits the spread of aphrodisiac particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe infection is more common in older people (over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for individuals, which limits the ability of health systems to handle patients with COVID-19 who require sudden hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilator support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory tract syndrome (ARTS) develops in COVID-19 and oxidation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control methods and high PEEP capacity artificial respirators are required to reduce the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pneumothorax (Pneumothorax) and to increase oxygen supply.
High PEEP on old ventilators may go without
The study for potential treatments started in January 2020 and various antiviral drugs are under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be very promising.
While it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be attempted in more severe patients.
Volunteers, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), participate in efficacy and safety trials of the potential treatment. The FDA has granted provisional authorisation for disinfected spermatozoa as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the spread of the disease
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app uses surveillance data to detect 'close contact', thereby detecting the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation if the possibility of danger is detected, but also alerts local health authorities. Mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile location detection, and artificial intelligence enable people with the infection to be able to detect infected people and to know who they came in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government helped security agencies track the mobile phone data of people who were allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
The move was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who could come in contact with affected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared integrated phone location data with Robert Koch, a German federal government agency to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is using facial recognition technology to identify violators of quarantine.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said he was informed by mobile service providers that ""40 per cent of the population continues to roam""."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kalijulaid has called for a solution from around the world to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience pain from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturns are the perfect storm that could harm people's mental health and physical health."
The disease may take a moderate course with or without some symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with already severe or critical illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 is limited. In some individuals, COVID-19 can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In those with severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, fasciitis shock, or multi-organ failure.
Problems associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unusual clots, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4% of these patients.
About 20-30% of those who come with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transmines).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, of which five days are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the initial case study, the average duration from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while for women it is 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of pulmonary samples on post-mortem show multiplicity of damage that can be transmitted with leakage of cellular fibromicsoid in both lungs.
Pneumocytes were observed to have cell-influenced changes caused by the virus.
The picture of the lungs resembled acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
Heart attacks, including troponin levels and a heart attack, increased by 11.8% in deaths, according to a report by China's National Health Commission.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing health conditions. the availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary from this condition due to those regional differences, but also due to formal complications.
A lack of awareness of the severity of the disease will lead to an increase in the mortality rate.
However, the fact that there have been deaths as a result of illness in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term continuation of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that lung capacity for some people who had recovered from the disease was declining by 20 to 30 percent, and suggested that pulmonary radiographs caused damage to the organ.
This can lead to post-acute recovery after treatment.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether it provides effective and long-term immunity to people who recover from a past infection.
Immunity is seen as possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it has been reported that those who have recovered from COVID-19 have received positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
It is believed that these patients are more likely to have a worsening of chronic infection than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural and originated from an animal by direct infection.
The true origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely human-to-human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official releases by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed early symptoms on 8 December 2019.
There are several methods used to estimate death.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as test size, health system quality, treatment choices, time since initial infection and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the number of emergency ICD-10 disease codes to deaths of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as U07.1 and deaths of COVID-19 detected without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as U07.2. The ratio between deaths and cases of disease detected over a period of time is the same as the number of emergency deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global infection-to-death ratio stood at 6.9% (1,53,822/2,24,0191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease and the Infectious Death Rate (IFR) reflecting the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from the disease.
These figures are not time-bound and follow a specific group of people who have been infected through the course of the disease.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the heart of the outbreak in Italy, 4,60,080 (1.7%) people have already died in the small village of Castiglione de Ada.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through Carnival festivities, and spread to younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths were formally classified.
The health system in Germany is not very good.
In the Netherlands, an estimated 3% of people who donate blood may have an immune response.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
In China and Italy, the number of deaths in men was higher.
For men, the risk is higher when they are in their 50s, while the gap between men and women has only narrowed in the 90s.
The death rate in China was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immune differences, lower smoking in women and the formation of morbid conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age in men than in women can cause higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are men and 72% of those who died with COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sexual-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and are at high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease, and 19 stands for 31 December 2019 when the disease outbreak was first identified.
The name is named according to an international recommendation to prevent naming with the intention of stigmatizing a specific geographical area (e.g. China), animal or group of people. The COVID-19 generating virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO additionally uses ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications."
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
Both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus" during the early outbreak in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the names 2019-enkov and 2019-enkov acute respiratory disease as interim names in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against the use of names of places for disease and pathogens.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in common supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing sanitary products such as nasal swabs and artificial respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to provide the required amount of time, a local start-up was able to re-engineer and print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and distorted information about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the internet.
Humans have the ability to transmit the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence for the transcription of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being carried out by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a ""solidarity trial"" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four well-functioning antiviral compounds based on their existing efficacy."
There are currently no vaccines, but several companies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
Previous work by SARS-CoV has been used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being tested.
First, the researchers aim to develop a full-blown pathogenic vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to demonstrate the human body's immunity against the new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategic, sub-level vaccines aim to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subgroups of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (deoxyribonucleic (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccines, a modern technology for vaccine development).
The experimental vaccines received from either of these strategies are to be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began in Seattle with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the pathogen that causes the disease. Immunological development in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is suggested as a possible challenge, but this is debatable.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials are evaluating treatment for already recognized malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese studies have largely focused on alternative antiviral drugs, with results from nine phase III trials of remdesivir expected by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was in place till April 2020. Existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lobinavir/Ritonavir and Ritonavir combined with Lobinavir/Interferon Beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir.
Clinical progress was observed in patients who had not yet been approved for Remdesivir treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied with initial results in February 2020 in China.
However, there are calls for reassessment by those who work with the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, suggesting that the dose is twice as dangerous and life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating those with COVID-19. China's 7th Edition guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent objectively SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been further recommended in the vivo study after proving low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that early pin protein pruning by transmembrane protease serum 2 (DMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without acethromycin, are subject to a high threshold, which prevents the medical world from accepting them without further studies. Oseltamivir does not objectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-resistant storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China based on a small study result.
It has undergone a two-stage randomized trial nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
The identification of cytokine storms is combined with a blood test of serum ferritin, which is thought to be responsible for the death of some of the victims and to counteract some of these advances.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of interleukin - 6 receptor antagonist based on studies of a retrospective infection in the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome, a different cause known as CART cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of refined and enriched antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for alternative immunisation.
This strategy was tried to SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which the passive anti-protein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as anti-protein-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or bococytosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of prepared homologous antiprotons, are in progress.
The fluid portion of the blood taken from recovered patients and the production of pathogenic mucosal that has a specific antibody to this virus may be increased for rapid use.
Coronaviruses, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, died after contracting COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
