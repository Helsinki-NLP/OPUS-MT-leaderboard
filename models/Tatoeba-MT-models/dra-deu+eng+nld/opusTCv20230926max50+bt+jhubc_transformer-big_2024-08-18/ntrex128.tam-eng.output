I'm worried about the "stupid" ones.
There is a confusion among some AMs that their title should be changed as MWPs (Welsh Parliamentarians).
This is due to the change of the name of the House of Representatives.
They were concerned that the entire political spectrum could be affected by this.
A Labour AM said his team was "concerned" that it "synchronizes with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't live in Wales: twp in Welsh means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Floyd AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but that Muppet had a minor verbal problem from the MWP.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced like the English pronunciation of Yorkshire.
The Legislative Commission, which is presently drafting the law to introduce name changes, said: It will certainly be for the members to decide how the legislators are invited at the end of any one interpretation.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the recommendations, which had the majority support for calling the legislature the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AMs' title, the commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP's preference was more favoured in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for Chief Executive Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within a few weeks.
The law on reforms also includes other changes on the way the legislature works, including the rules for disqualifying AMs and the composition rules of the panel system.
During the law debate, AMs will have a final vote on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote system was set up in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province known as Macedonia.
Athens has long said its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership efforts for the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, said he would boycott the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Soren Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells fall during the Battle of Harlem
"Earlier, when I was talking to adults, they used to say that every corner had a bar and a church.
Today, there is nothing.
He said he understands the loss.
He said that nowadays people are coming together in different ways.
Bedrooms are no longer the places where people go to sleep.
In the case of churches, the money generated by the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, he worries, "sooner or later they will be back where they started."
He said that people who do not help the sanctuaries will come to the temples instead of the temples.
The majority of the buyers of individual dwellings in these buildings are white, he said, adding, "These churches will be closed down altogether, because those who buy these separate dwellings will be members of the churches."
The two churches built by whites in front of Harlem are for blacks - the Metropolitan Community, 1870, a decade after St. Martin.
The original White Methodist meeting, left behind the 1930s.
A nearby black church took the title of the building.
The Rev. St. Martin came under the control of a black church under John Howard Johnson, who opposed the promotion and hiring of blacks, boycotted retailers on Main Street, 125th Street, which was for shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they sold the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called Carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it a cultural treasure and "an irreplaceable historical tool."
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan said it was the first carillon in the world to be played by Dionysio A. Lind, a black musician who had gone to the Great Carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not compensate him.
Driven in St. Martins over the past few months, it has been a complicated story for some architects and contractors who have been brought in by church leaders and through the Episcopal diocese.
The appointed leaders of the Westri - the Diocese's governing body - wrote to the diocese in July that architects and contractors sent by the diocese were "expecting costs" for the diocese, despite the fact that Vestry was not involved in hiring them.
Some church members complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.
A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark in Lapster, California.
A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark and injured when he jumped to catch a lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beckens Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamal told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing in the water with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and approached the team to help take the boy out of the water.
"At first I thought he was yelling at me, but then I realized he was shouting, ""Killing, biting!"""
I've got the pie!"
When I got close to him, I saw that his entire neck had been torn."
I told everyone to come out of the water and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>There is a shark in the water!’
The boy was airlifted to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was admitted in a critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark was involved in the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it was not a dangerous shark.
He added that there were serious injuries on the body.
The beaches from Bondo Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Isinitas have been closed to the public for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Gills said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's plans to focus more on the UK's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's has brands such as Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with beautifully stacked items in department assistants and department stores.
The UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.8 billion, continues to grow despite a drop in sales of fashion and home goods. The 11 stores across the country are set to test the big cosmetics, and if successful, will expand to more stores.
“Stores that used to have televisions, microwaves and home appliances are now investing in cosmetics to make room for cosmetics”.
Sainsbury's says it will double its size to sell up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Brands like L'Oreal, Maybeline, and Burt's Bees have more space in branded products like Boots.
The supermarket wants to re-introduce its boutique cosmetics store. Most of the products are made in wagon mode.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will offer discounts on two Sainsbury's stores, the first store to open in Croydon in south London last week and the second store to open in Chely Oak in Birmingham later this year.
As people have become accustomed to shopping online and buying low-cost food in stores near their daily needs, supermarkets have had to come up with additional plans to get them to the stores and visit.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coop said the supermarket is trying to sell more services and non-food items than discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl.
In hundreds of stores, Argos stores are being set up by Sainsbury’s. Habitat is also launching more and more stores, both of which were purchased by Sainsbury two years ago. Both of which strengthen the sales of supermarkets, making them more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to revamp its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industry failed.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint sale with Boots in early 2000, but the joint sale ended in confusion as to how to split the drug store's profits from its supermarket profits.
Sainsbury's has sold its 281-store drug store for 125 million euros after selling it to the company's owner, Celesio.
Lloyd's said it would go ahead with plans to sell products from the more expensive Skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and the surroundings of our beauty products for our customers.
We also have a trained staff to assist in the sales process.
Our brands are the hubs of beauty products that challenge the old shopping system because they cater to every need and are conveniently located in places with a unique design."
Peter Jones is angry with Halle Berry after he pulled out of a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11 million.
Peter Jones is angry at the departure of TV presenter Hallie Wilby from Peter Jones' 11-million-euro deal to focus on a new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
They don't have time to spend on their brand.
The pair's business has been compared to the Goop brand of Kenneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old announced his retirement on Instagram this morning.
Peter Jones of Dragon's Den fame is angry because he decided to give up his lucrative brand at the last minute and focus on a new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Reliable reports revealed that Jones was angry when a television presenter told him about the meeting at the headquarters of his commercial building in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that Wilby did not have enough time to focus on promoting their true brand due to Wilby's new contracts worth 1.5 million euros.
The business was compared to the Baltro-in-Goop brand and was expected to be more than double Willaby's estimated 11 million euro business.
Willaby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the UK, leaving Jones at one of her vacation homes.
It's fair to say that this is based on the priorities of the Conservative Party.
He is determined to have a long-term vision for the next 20 years.
The decision came as a shock to everyone involved.
No one could have predicted what would happen on Tuesday.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters was ready for sale.
Experts say that this morning's departure of the presenter will cause the company's investment in mattresses, candles and household items to be severely hampered, and its release will be further delayed.
A long-lasting friendship may come to an end.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, had been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Gup, for ten years.
Willaby started the Truly business in 2016 with Cape. In March, 52-year-old Jones took over as president.
The couple used to go on vacation together. Jones held a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willaby is the brand ambassador for M&S as an alternative to I'm a Celebrity presenter from ITV, Ann McBridelin.
A person close to Jones said last night that he could not comment on Jones' business dealings.
"Love is born" after a hard fight.
He also ridiculed the North Korean leader for his positive remarks and possible criticism from the media about him for not speaking up.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Trump said it in the voice of "the newsman."
I didnt give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump's first meeting in Singapore, the first step towards making North Korea a nuclear-weapon-free state.
But the debate over the cessation of nuclear attacks has stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top official, Ri Yong Ho, told UN leaders on Saturday at a public meeting that there had been no "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's rapid weapons-smuggling operations.
Instead, he sees the U.S. as allowing things that are aimed at sustaining pressure.
During his speech, Trump spoke in a very positive tone.
We have good relations with North Korea.
There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We have a good relationship now, he said.
The goal is to complete rocket tests, release hostages, and send the remaining U.S. troops home.
He said his efforts to improve relations with China have been successful.
Trump told a gathering in front of him that there were 200 people here, rather than trying to force 10,000 people inside the complex.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, they were told that there was no need for foreign non-governmental organizations.
Although 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster declaration has been issued, the primary source of international aid.
In many cases, they have made it clear that they have unfortunately not asked for international assistance, which is a bit of a challenge, Sambang said.
It is not yet clear where the foreign workers will work, sending a team to travel to Balu to save the children.
Sutopo, a national disaster communications spokesman, said Indonesian authorities were studying the situation in Balu to see if international companies were allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Although the Indonesian people often suffer from earthquakes, the people of Indonesia, who are the victims of nature's fury, are not prepared.
Although tsunami settlements were built in Aceh, they are not commonly found in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning has been issued, the absence of a siren is responsible for the deaths.
At this time, traveling between several islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters are becoming more and more complicated.
A hospital ship docked at Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims sails toward the island, but it takes three days to reach the new area of concern.
President Joko Widodo, who campaigned at the center of the election campaign to fix Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure, spent generously on roads and railways.
However, due to budget cuts next year, the company's management is facing a financial crisis.

Note: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge Tips Deep Balance and. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge had bought the pass from Xherdan Shaqiri-Left when they were 30 yards from a Chelsea goal with a team trailing 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before he could make a shot towards the distant post.
As it moved towards the top right corner of the net, that effort went above the box as well.
Then he went to the Ka'bah and sat down on the ground.
To that end, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com that he was trying to make himself look like a shack-like player trying to get the ball.
He looked at it and took a long shot.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, Matteo Kovacic was given a blues-striker pass pack before spinning near midfield and sprinting in Liverpool half.
Kovacic, in midfield, provided a quick give-and-go.
He hit the ball that was dangerously inside the box.

The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster agency says the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake and up to 20 feet of high waves.
The town of Balu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder.
The investigation into the murder began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Merseyside Birkenhead.
A 44-year-old man with cut injuries was found in John Street Crasson Muse at 7.55 a.m. The 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked the public to come forward if they heard anything about the incident in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The preliminary investigation is ongoing. I would urge anyone who has seen or heard anything around Birkenhead's John Street to contact us.
I'd like to ask someone, especially taxi drivers, if the dashcam camera in the car could have captured something.
A police spokesman said the body was of a woman from the Birkenhead area and that there was a body inside a building there.
The woman's friends were called to the scene of the incident this afternoon and questioned as to whether she was the victim in their eyes this morning.
Police said an investigation is underway and efforts are on to inform the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver who lives in the Grayson Meuse area told police that no one in the area should leave or be allowed in while trying to return to his home.

Cromwell's statue is the latest target in the "Rewriting History" series.
Many of England's cultural and religious antiquities were considered by his radical saints to have been as destructive as the Taliban, and were exiled.
But the Gramwell Society explains that Mr. Crick-Kin's idea is stupid and is trying to rewrite history.
"John Goldsmith, president of the Gramwell Society, said: ""The current debate over the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster is inevitable."
Gramwell did not order or undertake to break the marks of England's civil wars.
Perhaps he was mistaken for Thomas, his forefather, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorncroft's wonderful portrayal of Cromwell is a testimony to the 19th-century concept, and many historians consider it appropriate to celebrate him.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Gramwell was celebrated by many more at the end of the 19th century than he is today as a protector of Parliament from external disturbances and pressures in the monarchy.
It is only after a thorough discussion that we can know whether it is true or not.
The subsequent development of our country was the result of the chaos that took place in the middle of the 17th century, and Gramwell was the only person who represented part of that divide.
"His achievements as a leader should be remembered and celebrated."
Chinese farmer dies of swine flu
According to local media reports, a pig farmer has died after being attacked at a market in southwest China.
He was known only by his family name, Yan. The farmer was found dead in a market in Liubansui, in southern China's Guizhou province, with severe injuries from excessive bleeding in the heart.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a piggery on May 30, 2005, in the city of Sining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went to nearby Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead and the door of the nearby pig pen was open.
He said there was blood on the man's face.
A report by the Department of Forensic Science confirmed the death of the farmer, who was hit by a 550-pound pig.
According to Guiyang Evening News, the farmer, known by the family name 'Woo', said that his relatives' legs were bloodied and in a disfigured state.
The footage captured by the surveillance camera shows Yan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yan or his relative.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked and locked to prevent anyone from attacking it.
Yan's family and those in the market demanded compensation for his death.
In the past, it was very rare to see wild animals attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in a field in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a farmer in Wales hid a 650-pound pig in his tractor.
In 2012, a farmer in the state of Oregon was attacked by his pigs. A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but they can be aggressively attacked by the taste of blood.
"They are sporty.
We misunderstand them. they don't come out to attack you.
You just have to show them respect."
The rest of the storm will bring heavy rain to much of the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, the storm Rosa is weakening and moving across the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Rosa is expected to make landfall with a wind speed of 85 miles per hour and a Category 1 storm. The center is 385 miles southwest of Punto Igua<0xC3><0xAD>a, Mexico, on Sunday morning.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean, which is heading toward the west coast of the United States, and will push the tropical humidity in the north to the southwest of the United States when Baja California makes a tropical storm over Pennsylvania on Monday.
The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, when the tropical moisture reaches the newly formed low pressure, it will cause widespread rainfall over the southwestern parts of the country in the coming days.
Domestically, 1 to 4 inches of rain is a dangerous flash flood, litter overflows and landslides in the desert.
Rainfall between 2 and 3 inches per hour is expected in some areas, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona, due to low tropospheric humidity.
Rainfall between 2 and 4 inches is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
As a result of the tropical rains, the situation is likely to worsen soon and there is a possibility of sudden floods.
It is very difficult to walk in the desert when there is a tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, the canals turn into torrential rivers. thunderstorms, accompanied by strong winds, cause dust to build up.
A low pressure area is now expected to bring heavy rain to the southern California coast.
Heavy rain is likely to hit the roads in some parts of the state.
It was the first rain in the area since the storm.
There will be scattered tropical showers in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, followed by widespread rain on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected in all four corners of the country from Tuesday to Wednesday.
There will be some extreme temperature changes across the United States in October as the Arctic cools down, but the tropics will remain hot.
Sometimes it can cause dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
The dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday are a great example.
There was a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa, and St. Louis.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer temperatures will re-emerge and try to spread.
Temperatures over much of the central and eastern United States are expected to be moderate in October, from the southern plains in the 80s to some parts of the northeast.
New York City could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates there is a lot of chance that temperatures will be above average in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the trial on six television networks on Thursday of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stance continued: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake struck a deal with the FBI to hold a week-long investigation into the allegations, without airing the regular programs for a last-minute turn on Friday.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Carey had pulled himself into a drunken stupor at a high school party and had tried to take his clothes off.
Kavanaugh is 100 percent sure that's not going to happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen said.
The average person has seen it on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other networks, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which aired it, were not immediately available.
There are a number of ways to measure the number of visitors to the office.
It was the size of an audience visiting a playoff football tournament or Academy Awards.
The FOX News channel strongly supported Caretaker's nomination, thus garnering an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the one-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was a lot of interest after the interview.
Fleck was the central character in Friday's incident.
Flake was snubbed by protesters in the presence of CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he attempted to go on an elevator for the Judiciary Committee's hearing, after the neutral Republican office issued a statement saying he was in support of Kavanaugh.
He was interviewed for several minutes on the BBC's live broadcast.
A woman said I was standing right here in front of you.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
He said, "You have power when many women are powerless."
The Elevator said that Blake had made his office report and that he would say much more at the committee hearing before it was closed.
When the judicial system voted before the entire Senate voted on the nomination of Kavanaugh, cable and broadcast networks all recorded live.
But Flake said he did so understanding that the FBI, which the minority Democrats insist on, would investigate the charges against the candidate next week.
Flake was pacified by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Gouns.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had value, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve scrutiny without a trial.
President Trump has ordered an investigation by the FBI into the allegations.
Britain's Prime Minister, May, accused critics of "politicizing" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her intention to leave the EU of "doing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In an interview next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson said the proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other fees was "absolutely fake" and attacked the checkers' plan for Brexit.
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest Titan Simpson, suspect in LSU athlete's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baden-Rouge Police Department said the 20-year-old was arrested on second-degree murder charges.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Simpson and Simpson, and police said the Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS co-WAFB reports that Simpson's DNA was found in the glass found by police from the scene.
After questioning Simpson, he confessed to the murder.
His lawyer said the deal was valued at $350,000.
The office of East Baden-Rouge Parish Coroner issued an initial statement on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the public for assisting in the investigation.
LSU athletics director Joe Alewa thanked the law enforcement agency for "working diligently to save justice."
Simon was 20 years old.
Baden grew up 6-foot-6 in Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "dropped" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
That's what you worry about all the time, Wade said.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after noticing the phenomenon in the mouth of the volcano, with 183 gas and ash leaks recorded in 24 hours.
There were several checkpoints and checkpoints in the area.
Photos of thin gray film on car windshields have been shown on social media in the surrounding areas of Mexico City, such as Sochi.
Since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have found more emissions in a volcano about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as "Don Koyo," has been erupting since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists during the Independence Day celebrations.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona after pro-freedom demonstrators clashed with police and joined thousands of protesters at a protest rally marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's separatist vote.
A masked separatist supporter who beats eggs, throws powder paint on the streets, and mixes with tourists.
Clashes broke out later in the day as the police started using lathis.
Protesters chanted "Live in Spain" against the slogan "We will not forget, we will not forgive" raised by pro-freedom groups for hours.
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries.
Tensions were high in the liberation zone, though separatist cadets celebrated it, a year after Madrid declared the October 1 Referendum illegal.
While those opposed to separatism declined to vote, there were those who enthusiastically voted for independence.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling at polling stations in violence zones.
Protesters marched through the night in support of the police.
Even though the protest took place, it was forced to happen in another way.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, accompanied his wife in a separatist demonstration, no longer believed in the independence of Catalonia.
We had some of the best times last year.
"We have seen the joy our parents felt about voting, but now we are trapped," he said.
The Catalan pro-independence parties are struggling to retain this year's moment with the best leaders under house arrest, facing sentencing, despite last year's regional election.
The 42-year-old Mechanic John Buick, who filmed the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the issue was raised by politicians on both sides.
"It's becoming more and more important," he said.
On Saturday, a Catalan leader named Oriol Junqueras, who has been on trial since late last year, said he would take part in the next European parliamentary elections.
Contesting the European elections is the only way to rid the Spanish state of its democratic values and repression, he said.
London: A man was arrested after his house was hit by a car.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested in Londonderry for crashing into the house by a car.
The incident was reported at the Bollinger Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Deputy Inspector Bob Plemings said there was damage to the door and the building.
There may have been a leak in the car.
In the case of the Menga Strike Rangers, it gave Livingston a 1-0 win.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga's first goal for Livingston was a success.
Livingston surprised Rangers by handing over Steven Gerrard to fix his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ifrax Club.
In Gary Holt's move to Hypernyms, Dolly Menga's strike proved to be different.
Gerrard's side, which has won the Premiership this season, will be on the minds of the leaders, with eight points ahead on Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Since replacing Kenny Miller last month with head coach Holt, Livingston has extended his unbeaten run to six unbroken games.
Livingstone missed his chances against the Blundell visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead of the curve before scoring with their straightness causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson kept his efforts ahead of Cole, and Alain Lidkov, who met Craig Halkett during Cole's time, was able to deliver.
Knowing that it can be troublesome for those who have visited the set settings, the hosts agree to play the Rangers before them.
That was the main goal.
The rangers agreed to a free kick, and to start the Livingston entry, Teklan Gallagher and Robinson touched, setting the menga scoring from the center of the box.
On the stage itself, the Rangers dominated, but were unable to penetrate the home side. goalkeeper Liam Kelly was restless.
From Kelly, though Alfredo Morelos insisted on a presence, the system continued into the second half.
Although Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, Lithgow gave Wide in another Livingston set match.
Even after the Halkeds challenge by transfer player Glenn Middleton, and after the two penalties that were docked as one for the handball, the cross came to the Livingston box and continued to be removed.
A Distinction from Livingston-Left - Study
Tony McCaroni at the Arena, BBC Scotland's Alastair Lehmand
A unique game for Livingstone and the end.
They will continue to advance each other's aspirations on this forward trajectory.
Since returning to the top flight, their playing style and personalities have changed a bit, but from the time they arrived, Holt has had all the credit for shaping the team.
He has many heroes.
While Captain Halkett looked at the deep, well-coordinated defense, Menga kept Connore Goldson and Joe Ware on the alert.
The Raiders, however, were underwhelming.
Although they were in good condition, they were below the standard.
Their last ball stagnated. Once they opened the home page, it was a wake-up call for those who felt themselves on the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had a mixed reception at Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as there was a meeting of Turkish and German leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, in order to mend ties between NATO allies.
They were out of action on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open the largest new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police reportedly deployed security to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large crowd of supporters gathered in the nearby area to see their chancellor.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
He is also celebrated as a hero by some German people, while others call him a tyrant.
Biker dies in road accident in Deptford
He died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 BST on the busy Deptford Road at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in the south-east of London.
When the driver stopped the car, others came forward to help.
The accident took place a few months ago on Childers Street, about a mile from where he died after colliding with a cyclist.
Police said they are trying to trace the family members of the deceased.
The road was closed and buses were diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area where the incident took place.
Long Lord's prison: Six officers injured in riot
A prison office source said six prison officials were injured in an attack on a high-security prison.
The rioting at the Long Lord's prison in Warkastersee at 09:30 BST on Sunday still continues.
Tornado special agents were called in to quell the riot, and eight of the rioters were found and isolated.
The injured officers were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison officers are currently deployed to control the rioting at HMP Long Lord's prison.
Six injured persons are undergoing treatment.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, where the perpetrators will be identified by the police and their jail terms will be extended."
The HMP Long Lord's prison can house up to 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the governor of the prison was allegedly attacked by a prisoner and taken to a hospital.
In October last year, anti-riot officials were called in for assaulting employees with pool balls and the riots were quelled.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City have been affected by the sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa. (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical rain makes reaching Arizona difficult, but it is likely to happen early next week because of the storm’s residual energy that threatens to flood the entire southwestern desert.
The National Weather Service has begun tracking flash floods from western Arizona to southern and eastern Niveda, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The cyclonic storm Rosa will cross the Phoenix area directly on Tuesday, with rain showers earlier in the afternoon on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones have created tropical storms or pressure levels within 200 miles of the area around Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) formed within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona, and up to 6 inches in some isolated areas.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest, which includes parts of Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain and up to 4 inches in some isolated places.
In areas where there is no danger of sudden floods, the rains caused by Cyclone Rosa are beneficial because they have been affected by drought.
Flooding is a serious problem, but the rains have been beneficial in some areas.
Weather.com reports that more than 40 percent of Arizona's areas are experiencing severe drought, the second-highest category, according to a report by the U.S. Draught Monitor.
At first, the route of the storm was to cross the coast of Baja California, Mexico.
A severe cyclonic storm rose 385 miles south of Punto Igua<0xC3><0xAD>a in Mexico on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm weakens as cold water pours into the Pacific.
The storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
There is a risk of heavy rain and flooding in parts of Mexico.
According to Weather.com, rainfall from Baja California to Sonara in the northwest is expected to be 3 to 6 inches, with a chance of 10 inches.
Then, as a tropical depression, it will move northwards from Rosa Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and from Arizona to the southern part of Utah late Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center said the main harm from Rosa or the rest of it is likely to be heavy rains in Baja California, northwest Sonara and the U.S. Desert Southwest.
This rain causes life - threatening floods, dusty winds in the deserts, and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton stabbing case: Four arrested
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for allegedly attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy in Somerset by inflicting severe knife wounds.
The teen was found dead in the Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was declared life-threatening.
The police arrested four men, including a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man, in the Awan and Somerset areas.
The authorities asked them to provide mobile video evidence showing what had happened to someone.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's Democratic Party's hypocrisy a sign of anger
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said he would vote for Judge Kavanaugh to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and ruthless tactics.
Trump said the Democratic Party's meekness throughout his nomination process was a sign of indignity and indifference.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically and consciously denying the allegations that he and Christine Plassey Ford sexually assaulted him when he was a teenager several years ago.
He also testified at Ford's trial.
The American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day, the president said on Saturday.
He told a gathering of West Virginia attorneys that a vote to ensure Justice Kavanaugh, one of the legal justices of our time and one of those who have made achievements in public service, was needed.
The president implicitly stated that the Republican Party's importance would change in the by-elections because of Kavanaugh's nomination.
“One of the most important elections of our life is to be held in five weeks.
“I wasn’t running, but I was actually running,” he said.
That's why I fight for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump has argued that the Democrats aim to "prevent and deter."
A senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first key formal vote on Gana's nomination is expected to be cast in the Senate before Friday.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number continues to rise.
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday, and many were thrown into the sea by a giant wave.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of Balu, and waves over six metres (18 ft) from the sea began to blow in the evening, killing many and destroying everything south of their path.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Sutobo Purwo Nukaraho, a spokesman for the BNPB for Indonesia's disaster recovery agency, said in Jakarta that many people were stranded on the beach at work when the tsunami warning came in yesterday and died from not fleeing immediately.
Nukaraho said all the cars and houses were swept away during the tsunami and hit everything on the shore. Before reaching the coast, the speed of the tsunami was 800 kmph (497 mph) per hour at sea.
He said some of the trees had been cut down.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Balu.
The disaster agency released aerial photos of dilapidated buildings, shops, dilapidated bridges and water-logged mosques.
The aftermath of Saturday's attacks continues to affect the coastal city.
The earthquake was felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's assessment and technical input agency (BPPT) said in a statement Friday's earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic setting, located on the border of the long narrow sea, may have magnified the magnitude of the tsunami, the report said.
Nugroho said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and restaurants had been damaged.
He said the bodies of the victims were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, with 540 injured and 29 missing.
Most of the deaths and damage occurred in Dongla, the closest area to the epicenter of the earthquake, 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Balu.
Nugroho said there was a "total lack of communication" in Tonga.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were reaching the affected areas.
This is a major damage, but it could be even worse, the report said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami hit in Balu, despite authorities warning of waves.
In a video shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building was seen raising tsunami warnings to people on the street.
Within a few minutes, large waves swept through the shore, taking in buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
Due to the power cuts caused by the earthquake and tsunami, communication was completely disrupted and the officer had difficulty in integrating the area around Balu.
Officials said that although the Uyghurs were airlifted from Jakarta and other cities by Cargo flights, food and basic necessities remained with the victims.
The city's airport is only open for relief and will remain closed until the end of October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the relief camps in Balu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Tozepa said that they informed about the damages on the way even though World Vision personnel from Dongala were travelling safely to Balu and the staff had set up tarpaulin huts in the office hall at Baluvil.
He said that many houses had been destroyed.
This is very bad.
Some complained that while relief teams were in full swing, experienced outreach volunteers were preventing people from traveling to Balu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign aid and supplies can enter the country only if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasnt happened yet.
Aliya Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said the damage was still at the provincial level.
Yes, we can get international assistance next minute, which the government has declared a national disaster, but that has not happened yet.
After the earthquake and tsunami, on the second night of Balu, families and friends who were searching for their missing loved ones felt the pain of natural disasters.
A man was pulled from the water on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was trapped near her dead mother's body amid the rubble of the building.
The Indonesian national, Genton Subandano, who coached two missing paragliders at the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month, has been named as the country's top paraglider.
Everyone in the room, including Mr. Roe, was taken aback.
As a senior in the paragliding industry, I have a great feeling about this.
As soon as he received news of the collapse of the Roa Roa restaurant in the paragliding community, he recalled how WhatsApp sent messages to the Balu contestants at the Beech Festival.
Instead of blue, his messages are just gray.
He said he didn't believe the news.
In Newport, Levi's, thieves stole $26,750 when the ATM was filled.
According to Newport Police, the thieves stole $26750 when Brink's employee filled an ATM in Newport, Levy, on Friday morning.
The driver was in the car in preparation for emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and filling it with cash, McKarty said in a statement.
While he was doing the work, the money which was to be filled, 'was stolen by the person who came from the back of the Brink servant'.
According to reports, several people were suspected to be involved in the incident, but the police are yet to ascertain the exact number.
If you have any information about identity theft, call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yeh
Rap singer Kanye West has changed his name to "Ye."
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: He is commonly known as Kanye West.
For a time, 41-year-old West was known by his nickname, Yeh, which was the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced on Saturday evening, the moment West's new album Yanthi was expected to be released.
The show's director has announced that singer Ariana Grande has been transferred after she canceled the show for emotional reasons.
West said it was a shortened version of the current trade name and that it was also a name of religious significance to him.
"Yes" is the most used word in the Bible, and "yes" is "nee," West said while talking to a radio presenter about the title on the album.
So, I am you, I am me.
That's why it's from Kanye to Yeh-woo. It's about our goodness, evil, chaos and everything else.
This album is about all of us.
He was one of the most popular rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he gave priority to Love and Brother Love.
Even former West partner, JAY-Z, changed his name to Hyphen and, if not, the letter in the Capitol.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against its citizens.
Mexican President Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s says he will not use military force against civilians as it marks the 50th anniversary of the brutal attacks on students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged "not to use the military against the Mexican people."
As left-wing student movements began to take root across Latin America, forces held a peace march for the killing of 300 people at a time on October 2, 1968.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said he would provide a monthly grant to students and support the Mexican people by setting up additional free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities are what connects students to the criminal gang.
America, A.I. needs to double funding
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and A.I. trainer who has worked with Google, Apple and Microsoft, said the US should double its research efforts in this area as China is heavily involved in artificial intelligence.
Though the formal A.I. strategy is less than that of the United States, these views began to come up when many parts of the US Government were also announcing A.I. announcements.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it plans to become No. 1 in A.I. innovations by 2030.
"While other countries are far behind the US, doubling the research budget for the A.I. is a good start and we look forward to it,"" Lee said."
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said the doubling of funding would double the chances of U.S. AI achievements.
However, Lee's book: China, was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, one of the leading AI companies in Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, the AI organization that oversaw the top American Allolo Player. He was executive at Microsoft and head of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recognized the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, such as the roboticing challenges of the Defense Advanced Study Program agencies, in order to find out the next visionaries.
Lee said U.S. scientists need to work harder to get government subsidies.
Lee said that China does not take the best in education, corporates take the best.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies are taking intellectuals from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said even a change in immigration policies would help the U.S. Bolster in AI efforts.
I think everyone who has a PhD in AI should have their own green card, he said.
The State Council of China launched its next-generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
Just as the National Institute of Science and other government agencies are funding US researchers, Chinas National Institute of Natural Sciences is funding institutions, but the quality of academic work is poor in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense launched the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, tasked with recruiting partners from institutions and academic institutions.
DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
Like NSF, AI is currently investing $100 million a year in research.
The U.S. National Security Law on Artificial Intelligence has been out of action for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The name change was a solution to the decades-old dispute with Greece, which prevented it from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO, and the Macedonian people voted to change the name of the "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
Greece, which is part of the province of Macedonia, and the northern part of the country known as Macedonia, continues to register its entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that the name change would deprive the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population of their ethnic identity.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised the question of whether there would be at least 50 percent of the vote for the vote to be valid.
According to the question in the referendum ballot: Are you a member of NATO and the EU in accordance with the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the move, including Premier Joran Jave, debated whether it was right to allow institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia to become one of the countries from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth, for the freedom to live freely under the EU, because that is the security for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivier Georgieva of Skopje.
A number of MPs have said that the decision is up to them to decide, whether it is legal or not.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said there were no violations as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout percentage was 16. 66 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections when registered voters cast their ballots.
I came to vote for my children. Europe, where we live, said Jose Denevsky, a 62-year-old voter from Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Jaw, his wife Jorika and his son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on September 30, 2018, in support of the European Union's (EU) and NATO's Internet-leading name change.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Gaverdarkov was laying chairs in front of tents arranged by some who were boycotting the vote.
We are for NATO and the EU, but the service is not through the gate, Cavadarkov said.
Ours is a poor country but a self-respecting one.
If they don't want to include our Macedonia, they can join forces with countries like China and Russia to become a Euro-Asian country.
Prime Minister Jav<0xC3><0xA9> said that becoming a member of NATO would bring more investment to Macedonia, as unemployment stands at more than 20 percent.
Speaking after registering his vote, Prime Minister Jav<0xC3><0xA9> said he hoped that more than 80 percent of our citizens would support the EU and NATO.
The answer is "yes" for our future.
According to a survey by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research, only 30 to 43 percent of the vote was needed.
Another poll conducted by Delma of Macedonia reported that 57 percent of respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of voters said yes.
A minimum of 50% of the vote is required to be successful.
If the referendum fails, Western support for the government, which began in May last year, will fall sharply.
Note: For Sergio Aguero Cole of Manchester City, he traveled the entire Brighton defense.
In England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling opened Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Manchester.
It seemed like a good idea to take the lead in the 65th minute.
At the start of the area, Argentinian striker received the permit in midfield.

The Nationals are out of the playoffs and there's no reason to start another.
The winner was hoping to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies had play-off inputs to keep a game above the Los Angeles Dodgers of NL West.
The Rockies took at least one wildcard spot with a 5-2 victory at Friday night's Nationals. But they are still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can control the rubber, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowds and the other team will play at the highest level at any point I'm facing this year."
Why don’t I want to fight?”
Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but in such a context, Cerberus depends on the pitch.
Cerberus will pitch on Sunday and start the 34th in the Bullpen session on Thursday.

Trump's rally in West Virginia
While talking about the significance of the Republican turnaround in the midterm elections, the President referred to the context of Supreme Court Bret's attention.
What we have done is finished.
We are just two weeks away from the big election.
"It's so big, I'm not running but I'm running, and that's why I'm fighting for the big candidates," he said.
"You're looking at the Democratic Progressive Party, you're looking at this happening," Trump continued.
They're using something to try to take back their positions.
They don't know who we're harassing, who we're fooling to get power. They have the power, we don't give it to them."
Speaking of Democrats, he says, "stop and forget."
For the past four days, he has been speaking of the Democrats as "angry, unrealistic, and bad."
One thing that has received a great deal of outrage from the audience is that the Democratic Senate of the Senate Judiciary Committee named and named Dean Feinstein.
"Do you remember her answer?"
You've released the document.
Oh, what.
"No, it's really bad body language, it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a political party.
They can't speak their mind.
To condemn me, the moderators in my party voted, which was really surprising.
I was the last Labour MP to hear him say he doesn't want us to speak their mind.
A similar thing happened to my friend John Ryan of Parliament for his unrelenting support of racial discrimination against the Jewish people.
I've been asked to comment on Jeremy Corbyn's comments.
Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders over related issues such as responsible economic policy and national security in Europe.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labor Meeting on Friday said it "expects to be peaceful and constructive."
Most of the GC meetings on Friday nights will be like that in my eight years of local Labour MP experience.
But the tone in many meetings is not the same as it is today, and the ever-increasing, gentle politics that began long ago has been forgotten.
It is obvious that the Labour Party is unable to tolerate a variety of views, and every opinion is decided by the leadership of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became the leader. The people with whom I shared similar political views expected me to take positions that I did not like. The national interest decided that the EU was a single market and never agreed with them.
Whenever I speak in public - no matter what I'm talking about - I'm wrongfully condemned on social media for the disengagement, for the political position and for being opposed to being in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I'm so happy to be able to share my experiences with the people I work with.
I am amazed at the people who work with me, who are so firmly and professionally disciplined, and have never been disoriented, despite the fact that they face sexual and racially degrading abuses on a daily basis.
One of the most devastating aspects of this era is the degrading lashes.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party needed to develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer multi-minded as the party begins to shrink due to a lack of certainty or a change in the election.
Over the past couple of years, I've had a lot of people tell me that I shouldn't be doing anything wrong, and that I should be able to fix the problem.
But I am not here for politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because my extensive school classroom collapsed because of the Thatcher government's neglect and I decided to become a local councillor or a government minister to better serve the people in need.
I don't even remember the last presidential election.
"No one in Nottingham East is confused about my politics, but they don't agree with the current leadership.
I want to tell the movement's selectors on Friday that if the country moves towards Brexit, it will hurt families, businesses and our public services, and I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on expressing my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
I have a message to give to the people of my constituency, not to Nottingham Monument, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you. I assure you that there will never be any threat or political situation that will jeopardize my work for you.

Ayr 38 Team - 17 Melrose Team: Defeated Ayr Team, top of the list.
Although the last two attempts have created an environment in which the final results will change, there is no doubt that the winner of this grand Tennant Premiership match, Ayr, is the team.
They are in the top spot of the standings as a losing team.
At the end of the game, the team had a chance to win because of their excellent interception. Coach Peter Murshi was very happy.
"We are a team that can't be beaten because of the quality of our games so far, so I'm happy to be able to do that.
"Robin Christie said: ""Congratulations to the Iyer team, they used the opportunity better than we did."
Grand Andersen's 14th-minute effort was dominated by Iyer, who was knocked out by Frasier Kilimo. The yellow card for Rory Hughes, wearing a Scotland cap, was replaced by the Warriors.
Guillemo led the team with a lead with Benoit and Iyer tried to score 17<0xE2><0x80><0x93>5 in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Bagatt overtook Patrick Anderson's effort and reduced Leway by five points.
Ruvarit Knott suffered a serious injury, resulting in a long break. He was carried off the stretcher. The restart was led by Staford McDowell, but the attempt was turned down by Guillemot.
Later, the responsibility for Iyer was shown to captain Blair McPherson, who again saw the attempt of Bruce Calvin to stop Melrose's efforts by extra-players at the end of the tense spell.
However, the local team recovered. McPearson stepped in and attempted to lead the Iyer side when a yellow card was shown to Streisand Hutchison as he captured Kilimo without a ball from the penalty line-out.
Kilimo was again blocked since the game resumed. Kyle Rowe faced David Armstrong-in-the-box kick and blocked the local team's fifth attempt with Gregor Henry's flanker position.
The actor is about to embark on a new career in the entertainment industry.
It seems that he will be involved in the restaurant industry after actor Ford Kieran has been announced as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The popular BBC show was written by 56-year-old Jack Jarvis and co-starred with long-time comedian Craig Hemble.
The two announced the ninth series, which will be the last one, and Kiernan, who will move on to a different career after Cryglong, will play the lead role.
According to official records, he is the director of AdriftMarn Limited.
The Scottish Sun newspaper reported that Kiernan was involved in Glasgow's successful restaurant business, but Kiernan declined to comment.
Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
The Marines patrolled the Naval Headquarters in a flurry of activity in La Paz.
Blue flags fly in public buildings.
The slogan at naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon asks: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it."
Throughout the land-locked Bolivia, Chile lost its coast to a bloody 19th-century revolt, although once again it is eager to sail to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes have been with them for years, and Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1, five years after the debate.
Bolivia has the elements of unity and peace, and there will be good outcomes, said Bolivian scholar Roberto Calchatilla.
"Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice (ICJ) announcement on big screens across the country. It is hoped that the tribunal in The Hague will act in Bolivia's favour. After years of promising negotiations, it is expected that Bolivia will be forced to sea for the sake of sovereignty."
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, is set to face re-election next year, and he is expected to announce his decision on Monday.
In August, he vowed to move closer to the Pacific Ocean.
Some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favour of Pollia and that it will change some things.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to determine the limits of the Chilean border, and has agreed that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the last arguments were heard, said Bass Sarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The last four years may have been behind due to an underdeveloped Bolivia.
Sarade accused the present Bolivian government of having blocked the sea route.
He opined that the country's reputation of Chile was saved by Morales' militant ability.
Bolivia and Chile will stand at the same point and start talks, but it will be very difficult to continue discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltse rejected the idea, saying the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
He said Monday would mark the beginning of a new relationship with Chile, which would end 139 years of disagreements and bring benefits to both sides.
Galsatilla has denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most famous presidents, is now using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
He said Bolivia would not give up its right to self-determination in the Pacific Ocean.
It is an opportunity to look into the past.
North Korea says it can't stop an attack until it has confidence in the U.S.

Among opposition leaders, he said the US should follow through on the promises made during the summit in Singapore.
His comments are about the United States, with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, three months after the Singapore summit, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the near-concluded nuclear issue.
Ree said a "pipe-dream" that a series of clearances and the US objection to the end of the Korean War would put the North to the task.
He said Washington was wary of agreeing to commit without Pyongyang, who would be the first to take major disarmament actions.
US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is one thing that is doubtful, but Pyongyang has said that abandoning the arsenal is the only way to ensure the country's security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion releases the latest trend of head-dressing, on the way to the High Street near you.
Whether you want to add your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you don't need to go anywhere else.
At the Paris Fashion Week, designers Valentino and himself Brown unveiled the largest cap set for their SS19 collection on a runway featuring a stylish set.
This summer, he posted some of the rarest hats on Instagram and the designers introduced them while listening to their eye-catching material.
The best design of the Valentino is the beige-colored hat that adorns the head of the models.
Ornamental watermelons, the Wizard cap, and the pineapple are other large-sized ornaments, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Brown also released a set of different masks at the time of Halloween.
Many of the masks had lips that looked more like a honeybun lectern than a hot cowgirl.
There was something like a turquoise ice cream cone, and something like a scuba diving gear matched by slouchers and Googles.
If you're in the middle of this great adventure, you're in luck.
Some people say that the only way to make money is to go to the shops near you.
From Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, 'La Bomba' comes along with a two-legged prism and a large hat that can be seen by everyone.
On social media, the label behind the hugely popular rare hat has also been released, along with a straw-beach holding a swimsuit model.
The best is the Burnt Orange Rafia Pie with Rafia Fringing with the white leather handle, which will be on the Jacquemus'La Riviera SS19 collection, during Paris Fashion Week.
Legendary stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the next Summer to have big hats and beach bags. The designer has made such an impact that it is inevitable to avoid large jewelry on a scale.'
John Edwards: Language Requirement for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have consistently shown excellent academic performance, with individual and team effort in sports, arts, music and other social activities as well as excellent school results in 2018.
Represented by the Scottish Confederation of Independent Schools, with its 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools provide excellent service to students and their parents.
Independent schools not only prepare their students for the best higher education but also pave the way for them to create career opportunities and convert them into global citizens.
When a school develops its design and practices as an academic discipline, new languages become popular and a favorite choice within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If a man speaks to him in a language he can understand, it reaches his intellect.
When he speaks in his own language, it reaches his heart.
It is a strong reminder that English alone cannot be relied upon to build relationships and gain trust from other countries.
From the results of this year's examination, we can see that there are more languages within independent schools with higher examination rates.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
According to data received from 74 member schools of the SCIS, 72 percent of students in Mandarin received a higher grade A, 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of students studying French, and 63 percent of students studying Spanish received an A.
Scotland's independent schools teach key skills to children and young people who need them without a doubt.
In schools with independent school curricula, language is seen as a major choice, as is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of people who fill vacancies are affected by language impairment.
Language skills are very important for the future of the business.
In a globalized world, language skills are essential for the best business opportunities that languages require.
Whatever career you choose, learning a second language can be a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically lead to the emergence of someone who knows many languages.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of 4,000 UK youth, 75 percent of the population could not speak a foreign language. only 15 percent of the younger population could speak French.
This is why investing in education is so important.
With so many languages, this system can prepare children for meaningful employment in emerging economic conditions.
Within Scotland, every school differs in the languages they teach.
While many schools aim to teach new languages, other schools have expressed a desire to teach languages that, like Mandarin and Japanese, will be key to the UK in 2020.
Whatever your child's preference, there will be plenty of languages and teachers who specialize in that area to teach in free schools.
Scotland's independent schools provide a supportive environment for them to develop skills and the ability to succeed in the future.
It cannot be denied that language is important for the development of the country and for the global business environment.
In addition, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
The Free Schools will provide this opportunity to the young people of Scotland for their diversity and potential.
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron creates Lakers to launch a franchise in San Diego
Los Angeles Lakers fans can't wait to see LeBron James make his debut.
In San Diego, Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in Sunday's Preseason opener against the Denver Knicks.
How many minutes he plays is yet to be decided.
It will take less than 48 minutes," Walden said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudel tweeted that James would be playing for a limited number of minutes.
After finishing training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need any pre-conditions to step into this stage of my life," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This will be Trump's first of five summits scheduled for next week, including venues in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump is aiming to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, with Republicans temporarily holding out a vote to confirm who they would choose to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, as they risk losing congressional support during the November vote.
What time is Trump's West Virginia convention scheduled to take place tonight and how will it be viewed online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia convention, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
Trump's West Virginia convention can be viewed live on YouTube at the link below.
Trump plans to postpone the Senate confirmation vote for a week this week, citing sexual charges that are under investigation by the FBI.
But the primary purpose of these conferences is to rally support for Republicans in the run-up to November's election.
President Trump's five summits next week, therefore, aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters in the Senate and House of Representatives to try to secure and expand Republican majorities," Reuters said.
"Control of Congress is very important to him, so even in these difficult environments, the president will travel to as many states as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The West Virginia Metro News Department said that tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wespango Stadium in Wheeling, "may involve supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to get information from Pittsburgh's media."
This Saturday, Trump will travel to West Virginia for the second time last month, a state that won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to rally support for West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morris, who is trailing in the election.
According to Reuters, "it's not good for the president to be in a position to increase Morsi's vote count," said Simon Hayder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. men's singles team to battle it out
After a three-game losing streak, the four-team competition on Saturday afternoon is expected to give the Ryder Cup a much-needed boost.
The Swinging Pendulum is a fast-paced single-player game with no competitors.
What do you think are the possibilities now?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's four points, so we have a little bit of chances now," said Jordan Spieth.
With twelve more games left, the European team is four points ahead, so chances are high for them.
As Spieth has said, the Americans have little chance on their side, and both Spieth and Justin Thomas have scored three points each in the four games they have played, so they have a lot of responsibility to motivate them.
He was the first player in the game to leave Green Bay.
There was a lot of celebration during his round, playing with the goal of getting butt in all four corners, and he and Thomas reached the goal at a rate of two per ruler.
There was also an extravagant celebration in the match that won on the 15th, making it clear that the Americans deserved the win.
"You're very passionate about your game," he said.
All of these players are now gone.
18 points to win.
Only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the Rider Cup's indisputable experience over the last two days.
Europe's top-performing pairs scored four points out of four.
The pair who did not receive the "pokey" on Saturday afternoon was the only "Molywood" but they missed the mohies on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon. Then they received nine points again on Friday morning.
Their prudence and energy enthralled the audience, and on Sunday they won, showing Fleetwood or Molinari and there could be no other famous player who could confirm Europe's victory in the Lee Golf National game.
Both received points in different strategies at the same time.
Europe's success is something to be proud of.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson along with Alex Norran played very well in Sergio Garcia and took four balls in the morning.
Bogie and Friend Nine Duck were a stepping stone for the Spanish and Americans to get closer to victory.
No one is going to help you on Sunday.
It was a pleasure to watch Forbal and Forsham from a distance, looking at the understanding between the couple, the way they counseled, and the way they immediately changed tactics.
The European team has played particularly well so far, especially on the final day, but this form of the US side's performance in the round has undoubtedly helped them.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe lead the group 10-6
The European team is getting off to a healthy start on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 win over the USA in the series of the Foreball and Foursom tournament on Saturday.
The inspired-playing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the way with two wins over Tiger Woods and four points in the Li Golf National tournament so far.
Thomas Jorne's European team, to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeldine two years ago, dominated the US side in the morning's four-ball game to win the series 3-1.
In the four-person series, the U.S. team faced stiff opposition by winning two matches, but they were unable to level the points.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari became known as "Molywood" after a sensational weekend finale, becoming only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in a row from the opening match.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, they beat Woods and American Rookie Bryson Tecumseh more firmly in the 5&4.
Woods, who progressed slowly until Saturday's two-match series, displayed occasional brilliance, but now he has lost seven in a row in four-ball and four-man matches and has lost 19 of his 29 matches so far.
Justine Ross rested in the four-ball match in the morning and then partnered with Henrik Stenson in Formsums to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who finished first and third globally, 2&1.
It was a warm, sunny day in southwestern Paris, but Europe didn't make it.
The three-time major winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a goal for the Americans with two points in Saturday's match.
They won 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Boulter in a four-ball match, then beat Boulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 after losing two points in the opening game.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history have a team progressed from a four-point drop to a singles side, although Furyk's teams only need to level the competition to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, the counter-attack offered on Sunday seemed to them to be of an unexpected colour.
North Korea says "no way out" will lead to unilateral disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions had undermined his confidence in the United States and that the country had no option but to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
North Korea carried out "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising no further escalation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, he said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization.
"We have not received any response from the United States," he said.
"We cannot have confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States and in such circumstances we will have no choice but to unilaterally use weapons in the first place."
While Ri re-affirmed the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to its "phased-out" approach to denuclearization (which can be appreciated here because North Korea has taken gradual steps), his statement was significant because it did not arbitrarily reject a unilateral nuclear denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, saying Kim had promised to "take the necessary steps towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" as Trump said he would guarantee North Korea's security.
For the 1950-53 Korean War, North Korea demands a formal end, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the easing of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States, in order to compulsorily achieve its policy of ""first denuclearization"", increases the level of resistance to sanctions and ""opposes the declaration of the end of the war"", Tsi said."
"It's a daydream of people who don't know about us that economic barriers can make us kneel.
But the problem is that the continued economic sanctions are only further increasing our pessimism."
The US president made no mention of any plans for a summit between Kim and Trump at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and said: 'If the issue of denuclearization is not caused by the United States, but by South Korea, then there will be no resistance to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'
After President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" of a suicide bomb attack, Mr. Ri's voice was completely different from last year when he said it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would target the U.S. House of Representatives in Mainland.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for showing courage in taking steps to disarm the United Nations this year, but said more work needed to be done, like sanctions, until North Korea completely gave up its nuclear weapons.
"It could take two years, three years or five months, and there's no problem with that," Trump said on Wednesday.
China and Russia have called on the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions and the abandonment of nuclear weapons must continue until seriously, fully and finally verified."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met exclusively with Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July to protest North Korea's "powerful demands," saying the action had been taken.
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States carried out "relevant actions."
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" would be the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons to ensure adequate rest
Harvard students are taking the course to take adequate rest, and this year's introduction of a new curriculum at Harvard University has made it possible for all graduates to get more sleep, partly in opposition to the burgeoning culture of drinking coffee 'all night' and trying to get to sleep.
One educator found that students at the world's top universities don't seem to know much when it comes to how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first to be designed in the United States in this way.
He got the inspiration to start this course after giving a conversation on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the conversation, a woman came to me and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Why is this being told to me only in this year when my education will be complete?’”
He said no one told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The curriculum, which has been launched for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Pareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were losing intense sleep on weekdays.
The course lasts for one hour and includes a variety of activities.
There is a picture of a dorm room in a section where they click coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell students about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, it tells participants how long sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with icons that have an impact on one another encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students."
But we believe they have the right to know - and you have the right to know the health consequences of choosing to smoke cigarettes."
The culture of pride in 'drawing all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that lack of sleep is a growing problem with modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, a good quality of sleep, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, insomnia keeps the brain in hungry mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Cho, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics biology, helped design the course for Professor Chesler, who took one of his classes in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and prompted the campus-level course.
As a next step, he hopes to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar course of study before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Prof. Cessler also suggested that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be alert to the harmful effects of <0xE2><0x80><0x98>blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting permeating outside the guilder, leading to problems in sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal put Gerard's side down
It was another sad day for Rangers as Steven Gerrard's unincorporated team lost 1-0 at Livingston due to a strike by Dolly Menga.
The Ibraxas side tried to register their first win after a 4-1 win at St Johnston, but as the manager had to leave Runaway Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders' Hearts to stabilize his team's eight points, Carey Hold's team suffered their second defeat in Gerard's 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers were seen as less motivated as they didn't know how to balance it.
Now that the Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingstone has moved to third place, with a goal difference for them to reach the Hypernym.
The Rangers may have had further trouble after the lineman, Callum Spence, was treated for a head injury caused by deliberately throwing an object from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which sent Ayr Pettfred Cup fast into the semi-finals game.
On the other side, Holt went with the same Livi 11, which received a point from Horst last week, and he would have been delighted to see the way his well drilled costume kept their opponents quiet every time.
The Rangers may have dominated the goal-scoring, but Livingstone scored the most goals in the ball he got.
They should have scored two minutes when Menga's first-ever lay-off, Allan MacGregor, sent Scott Pitman through the goal, but the midfielder strained his big chance width.
The deep Keegan Jacobs free-kicks Skipper Crick Golfet was invented, but he was only able to be inserted wide enough in the back post by Alan Lithgow, a member of the opposing team.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have more confidence in their game.
Alfredo Morlas firmly believed that he and Steven Lawless had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark because of a collision, but the Columbians' appeals were dismissed by referee Steven Thompson.
Rangers only managed two first-half shots in the goal, but former Ibraxin goalkeeper Liam Kelly was obviously troubled by a goal scored by Laszana Coulibaly and a ruthless strike by Ovi Ejeria.
No one can deny the fact that Livi's 34th-minute opener could have scored against the opposition, and they deserve this for their dishonesty.
Once again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Orfield didn't show any reaction when Tegan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, and he remained silent in order to get Manga out for a simple decision.
Gerrard showed resistance at the break as he replaced Ryan Kendrick in the collegiate, with the change having an almost immediate effect as the winger put the ball in Marilaus, but Kelly, who was in a state of unconsciousness, left his line and ran to prevent it.
But after a long time together with Lithgow and Hulkette, Livingston continued to impress them by playing the same game that was enjoyed by the audience.
Haldane's team was able to carry the ball through to the finals, but Mekrakar did well in preventing the Jacobs before Lithgow took the ball from the corner.
The Rangers, who had replaced Glenn Middleton, asked for a delay in the penalty one more time as he had a problem with the Jacobs, but Thompson turned his face back.
Panchang: Geiger Gounder's discovery
Now let's start from the "Sunday Morning" page of the Panchang: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, exactly... Future Physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually gave the device the name Geiger Counter.
Geiger Gounder's discovery is notable for its scientific achievements, as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" was modeled on cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “Where in the world is that?”
Rogers: "Geiger counter is the method used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can better hear the effects of radiation on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it looks good now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention has made its name.
A new cancer vaccine has been found to boost the immune system in "mature" cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine has been developed to detect 'mature' cells, remove damage and boost the immune system.
The vaccine identifies the cells that are 'moved' as part of the treatment and boosts the immune system
This time, the task is to extract the immune cells from the patient and transfer them to the lab.
They found a type of 'brata' in various cancers and injected it back.
The trial results show that the vaccine gives hope to different types of cancer patients.
After a woman with ovarian cancer was found with 'serious' cells and vaccinated to boost her immune system, her cancer did not go away for the next 18 months.
In this method, the immune cells are separated from the patients and replaced in the lab by the protein that is commonly "found" in various cancers called HER2, which is then injected back into those cells.
"The results show that we have received a promising vaccine," said Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof Berzoffski explained that HER2 "has been linked to the development of a number of different types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
This same method of detecting "mature" cells, targeting those cancer cells and getting vaccinated to boost the immune system has resulted in a good outcome in the type of blood cancer.
After Kanye West appeared on the SNL, he started talking about him, wearing a big cap like Trump.
I don't feel well
Kenny West was trolled at the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would still be in power in 2020.
After she sang the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, wearing America's big hat, she raised her voice against democracy and extended her support to Trump.
"When I spoke to white people many times, they said, 'How do you like Trump? He's a racist.'
"If I had been born in the United States, I would have died a long time ago," he said.
Matt Damon began the SNL show with a comedy show in which the Hollywood star appeared, depicting the oath of office as Fred Kavanagh before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a lawsuit filed against the sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it didn't air, West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if he's going to be able to beat West in this game.
West also complained to the audience that he had come under severe criticism at the back of the stage because of the headlining.
"They put me behind the wheel.
"Don't go out with this guy."
They've attacked me!
"According to the Washington selectors, I'm in a very quiet place," she said.
As the West walks along, "Do you want to see the deepest peaceful place?" "Get dressed my Superman", don't ask me what to do next.
make love to you."
His comments impressed the audience and embarrassed the SNL team members, who reported that the single man, with his words, "the entire studio was silent."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande's ex-boyfriend and rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
He was dressed as a West Periyar and the song I Love It caught everyone's attention.
West was supported by a conservative group called TPUSA, who tweeted, "A very brave soul: thank you for standing up and speaking out against the rioters."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was him, so it was great."
"I don't want to encourage anyone (who doesn't buy his music or clothes or supports his "art") to post comments that are harmful to society.
Its free.
We are ready.'
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has now changed his name to "Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is also known as DD, Buff Daddy, Buffy and B Titty.
Following the rap singer, Snoop Dogg was nicknamed Snoop Lion, and the musician, formerly known as Prince, changed his name to Snoop Lion.
A man has been charged with attempted murder in connection with the Belfast restaurant stabbing case.
A 45-year-old man is on trial for stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Pallappura, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kid Harrington has broken common characteristics about men.
Kid Harrington is best known for his sword-wielding role in the HBO's medieval fantasy violence series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who has come out as a determined hero with typical traits, says on-screen characters like these are often not respected by young boys.
Speaking on Sunday Times Cults, Kidd said that the <0x23>MeToo era was about men questioning when something went wrong and why.
Kidd, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who co-starred in the series Game of Thrones with him, said he "feels very brave" about confronting the issue.
"At this point I'm feeling very, very brave - what's wrong with being manly," he said.
What do we do when we see a man who is blind, blind, and unable to see what he is doing?
Kitt believes that television is one of the main reasons for the increase in illusory view of men.
'What is normal and what is taught?' he continued to question
They are taught on TV and in the streets that they should only do certain things when they are young.
I think that's a really big question at this point - how to change that?
The most obvious misconceptions are taught to young people.'
When the series ended next summer, he said he would not star in the finale or sequel of Game of Thrones, adding that his "relationship with battlefields and horsemen is over."
From November, Kidd will star in the film Revival of Samford True, a film by the filmmaker and his brother and rap singer.
The best thing that happened to Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
"It was on this show that I met my wife, so this series has given me my future family and my life," he said.
Rose played the love interest Ygritte in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series as the love heroine of the Kitt character John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases detected in China
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were detected in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are due to a lack of physical activity in the past.
In earlier times, the disease spread rapidly due to blood transfusions from specific areas of China to others.
But at a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the level of HIV infection had been reduced almost entirely.
However, annually, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 people.
The impact of HIV on the LGBT community in China through sex was high.
Homosexuality was abolished in China in 1997, but the LGBTQ community is growing.
Studies say that due to the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Infection is often caused by unprotected sex in these methods.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has taken steps to make HIV drugs available to all.
Maxine Waters has denied that the employee's disclosure of GOP senators' data was a "blatant lie" and has claimed that it was purely a "conspiracy."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday strongly condemned allegations that one of her staff had leaked the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on a Wikipedia page called "Lakes."
Activists in Los Angeles called for "ultra-right wing" teachers and activists to take immediate action against the website.
"Liar, liar, liar is a very disgusting lie," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Arne Hutch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Capitol Hill on Thursday during a Senate panel hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct and was on trial in the Supreme Court.
The news was made public shortly after the three senators were asked their questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Editor and RedState have said that the IP address that can identify the source of the post is the one that emerged from Waters's office and that it was Waters' staff from Hill who published it.
Waters continued by saying that this baseless allegation was completely false and that it was a complete lie.
My employees, who have been falsely accused and have lost their identity, personal information and security, have no responsibility in the matter of publication of this information.
"This allegation is completely false and is completely false."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This statement is reprehensible," Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that he does not deserve to be a member of the Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They should not behave in this manner.
They don't question the culprits.
They need to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer criticized Waters's response to the Democrats' caucus, saying he was extremely angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican presidential candidate Omar Navarro also took to Twitter to voice his thoughts on removing Waters from office in the midterm elections.
"This is the greatest crime of truth," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office "strongly condemned the authorities and law enforcement agencies associated with this scam."
He said: "The culprits will be found and punished, even if they are my employees, for their actions and misconduct."
Johnny English Strikes Review - Power Low Rowan Atkinson Spy Spoof
Expecting Brexit's specials in any new British-style film has now become routine, making it seem that the same applies to the Johnny English action-comedy spoof version - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and has relaunched in Johnny English Reaper in 2011.
Is it fun to tell a story centred around how open-minded we are for the new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the irreplaceable Johnny English with a rubber-faced big eyes has had a chance to revive these for the second time - his gestures are at the forefront of everything else in non-English-speaking comic films.
He has acted as an outrageous yet curious secret agent, as well as played Cloza, somewhat mirrored by the contribution of Mr. Bean and Dalton, who set the theme on fire at the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
The now-disappeared Barclay Card, which caused confusion in his rise, was cast in a character based on a traveler and an international mystery man in television commercials.
There have been one or two fantastic moments in the recent JEE outing.
I like the fact that he's wearing a helmet when he's riding his bike in the middle of the road, and he's wearing a sledgehammer.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy has been put on display, but the comedy is perceived to be more powerful and different than the superficial. Especially the "Serious" movie brands 007 and Mission Impossible are now the main characters of the comedy.
I feel like the comedy is more in the kids than the adults, and for me they're not as innovative as the comedies that Atkinson's silent-film Johnny English portrays with his gritty and erratic acts.
Developmental behaviour has led to major problems in Britain.
The hacker has infiltrated Britain's powerful-secret network, denouncing the identities of all British agents in the sector, as well as an agent on duty who has played a minor role in the tragic death of Kevin Elton.
Playing the prime minister in the last series, he is losing his political influence in the series and Emma Thompson played the character of Quazi Theresa May very well, but the story does not compensate him.
His intelligence advisers inform him that he should seek the help of someone who is at rest as all the active spies have been compromised.
Pumpling Johnny English is currently employed at Bosch as a school teacher and teaches a number of non-textbooks, including the best techniques for espionage.
The English convened an emergency meeting at Whitehall, of which the most important was the expectation that Ben Miller would rejoin.
Bow is currently married and is also a Navy Commander who is married to comedian Vicky Pepperdine.
So it's very difficult for Batman and Robin to reactivate their majestic secret service, so Olga Kurlenko's beauty jewel Ophelia Bulletova was sought after.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is at odds with the tech giant's billionaire, who solves all of Britain's computer-related problems, with poor Jason Volta playing Jack Lazi.
English and Bowe launch their high-end Jinx's Odyssey, disguised as crews, they set the flash French restaurant on fire, defend themselves in the luxury boats of Volta, and the English begin to feel emptiness as they try to use the public virtual reality headset at Volta's home.
For the final scene, all the obstacles are removed, but the familiarity and the clamor are all over the TV for the children.
A beautiful sight.
But I can't imagine it in another Johnny English, couldn't the British film industry recognise Rowan Atkinson and his talent?
Workers in the UK work four days a week and are paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to seriously consider a five-day pay package that would allow UK workers to work four days a week.
The party also wants the revenue generated through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on to the enterprise employers along with the extra day off for workers.
Employees will have three days of paid vacation, but they will carry the same pay back home.
Sources said the idea is "suitable" with the party's economic progress and it plans to strengthen the country in favour of workers.
The trade union congress has approved a four-day work week as a way for workers to take full advantage of the economic changes.
"The policy is expected to be reviewed and announced by the end of this year," a senior Labour source told The Sunday Times.
'This will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is the party's approach to restructuring the economy in favour of workers, and fits in with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour cannot claim to have first accepted such an idea, having promised the Greens a four-day-a-week program during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the plan has not been approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
"The four-day work week is not considered by the party to be the party's policy," a Labour spokesman said.
Shadow executive John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
John McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from "directors who do not disclose their identities" and "profiteers" in the app companies.
Current shareholders in water companies should not withdraw their entire shares, as Labour may have to face a 'loss' due to the government's mistake, said the shadow executive.
He said he plans to incorporate workers on company boards and hand over 10 per cent of the shares of private sector companies to employees, creating a franchise fund owned by employees and for them to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year in dividends.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy on the television show "60 Minutes", asked if the FBI investigation of Kavanagh could change his mind.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Fred Carey has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's findings raise the question of whether Republican senators can be restrained from withdrawing their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" show reporter Scott Belle asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his friend from South Carolina.
"I think we can do it," Kennedy said.
"I said I went to the trial and I said I spoke to the judge carefully.
So I called him and he said, “What are you going to do?”
He was clear, concise, and forthright.
However, it is difficult to change Graham's wording.
"My mind is feeling very happy about Brett's attention span and it would take a cruel indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett vigorously denied it," Graham said.
He couldn't remember everyone's name.
Now 36 years old.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual concert, the Global Citizen Festival, will be held in New York, where a massive parade of exotic stars will take place, as well as the task of ending the so-called global poverty.
It is now the seventh year for the Global Citizen Festival, where tens of thousands of people can be seen flocking to the massive lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendis, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The said Global Citizen Festival in 2012 is an extension of the Global Powers Project (Global Poverty Alleviation Programme), an international advisory body that believes in ending poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert goers must complete a series of tasks or "actions," including volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or engaging in other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is it that Global Citizen is still 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is it right for people to feel that the idea of rewarding people with a free concert is an honest way of asking people to take action, or is it right that they are making a real difference - in another case known as "using social media" - by signing an online complaint petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters urging different targets.
These measures have helped inspire world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, it says.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements stemming from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been apportioned or raised as funds.
The Committee estimates that secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges include a joint venture of UK-based investors and implementers called The Power of Nutrition, which promises "to help children grow to their full potential" and, therefore, pledges to Ruanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region, after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, as you do, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a landmark in history," Ullmann said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 steps were taken to ask the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for Power of Nutrition, a program that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In the Frequently Asked Questions section of its website, in response to the question "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?".
Global Citizen replied: 'It will be a long and arduous road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed because together we will be more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mone, and Deborah-Lee Furness host the show this year in New York.
The U.S. could use the navy to block Russian energy exports - The San Diego Union-Tribune
US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed that Washington may take its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering markets in the Middle East, as the Washington Examiner has cited.
Jinghe accused Russia's involvement in Syria as a pretext for exploring new energy markets, particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to arrange and provide energy like they do in Eastern Europe, in Europe's southern stomach," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, through its navy, has the ability to keep sea lanes open and, if necessary, prevent them from accessing their energy market," he said.
Singh was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the "Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively identical.
Referring to Russia as "the only war-torn country" with an economy based on fossil fuels, he said, "Iran and Russia's economic will is to develop and replace almost all fossil fuels."
The reports come at a time when the Trump administration is working on exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe as a much cheaper option for European consumers, instead of Russia.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow continues to insist that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Remlin argues that economic reasons are Washington's strongest reason for opposing the project, and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I hope that we share the view that energy should not be used as a crisis weapon and that suppliers should be chosen by consumers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany has given a befitting reply to the approach of the United States, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The US has asked Germany's leading industry body, the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, German industrialist Dieter Kemp said, "It's a big problem for me, even if a third country interferes in our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will be "careful" in the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she must "act carefully" in the upcoming presidential election, following by-elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and mend our broken government, and that includes putting women first," he said.
"After November 6, I will be thinking carefully about the campaign for the presidential election."
During a town hall meeting, he talked about President Donald Trump, which means he's taking this country the wrong way.
"It's hard for me to think of Donald Trump doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We want the FBI to investigate before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own constituents did not necessarily want him to run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, "nearly" fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the measure.
Ex-Governor Dawes Patrick's candidacy was found to have the most support, with 38 per cent in favour and 48 per cent against.
Top-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will make a decision in January.
Sarah Palin commented on Track Ballin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Pauline, 26, was in Iraq for a year after being placed on a military list in September.
He was arrested and charged with assaulting a woman he knew on Monday night.
"I can compare the hardships my own son is going through, the hardships he's been through since his return, the PTSD endorsements and the injuries of our returning soldiers with other families that feel the pain," he told an audience assembled at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline describes his hand as "a major problem that people do not want to talk about," and refers to his son and other war veterans, who "looked a little different when they came back, they came back with a narrow mind, they wondered if their fellow soldiers and airmen and everyone else in the army had any respect for their dedication to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, for allegedly assaulting a woman, attempting to stop making a report of violence while intoxicated, and armed, said Dan Bennit, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 provinces, D.C. support challenge to new archiving policy
Eighteen provinces and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new US policy of denying asylum to victims of group or family violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 provinces and the District of Columbia had filed a court friend in Washington to support a policy that would challenge the insurance applicant.
The plaintiff's full name was not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by American Civil Liberties in August against federal policy.
He said his wife and "her violent group members" had bullied him, but U.S. officials have turned down his request to stay in an incubator on July 20.
He was stationed in Texas.
Grace, supported by prosecutors from the provinces, explains El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as nations encounter common problems of gangs and domestic violence, the number of applicants for U.S. incarceration in these provinces is high.
The new U.S. archival policy was amended to counter a 2014 decision by the Board of Emigrants that unauthorized immigrants may be allowed to enroll in an internment camp to escape domestic violence.
General Carl Razin, the prosecutor for the province of Colombia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of provincial, federal and international law."
"According to federal law, all archiving claims can be adjudicated on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, but those violations must have a primary cause," the court said.
Advocates further argued in support of the policy that denying immigrants would hurt the U.S. economy, and that they were more likely to come as entrepreneurs and "supply-needed workers."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to allow victims of domestic violence and gang violence to be held in internment camps since June.
"The asylum is for those who leave their home country because of religious affiliation or fear of persecution because of race, religion, country or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," she said in a statement on June 11.
Incubation is not the place to address all the problems that people all over the world face every day, even if they are very serious problems.
With the death toll in Palu doubling, rescue efforts were accelerated to identify the survivors
The situation is getting worse for the living.
"I feel very sad," said Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a baby boy who was suffering from fever in a rescue camp in Balu, where the tragedy took place.
"There's an ambulance every minute.
It's hard to get clean drinking water."
Residents are returning to their damaged homes, picking up items submerged, and trying to pick up whatever is available to them.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overflowing due to the damage caused by the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including Divi Harris, who suffered spinal cord and shoulder fractures, were resting outside Balu's military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors, with sustained minor tremors.
He said he felt a strong earthquake shake the fifth floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to defend ourselves.
I think I'm stuck inside the collapsed structures," Harris told The Associated Press, adding that she had stayed at the Balu with her family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was only silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador to China has accused China of "threats" over "campaign ads"
An official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. Daily promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, a week after the report, accusing Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
After denouncing China's interference in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 6, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to advertisements that China spent money on in the high-selling newspaper Des Monies Register in the province of Lowa, a claim China has denied.
Trump has accused Beijing of trying to meddle in US elections, with US officials saying Reuters was a new way to spread propaganda in Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war in which one country imposes harsh tariffs on imports from another country.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said the retaliation taxes, previously announced by China in the trade war, were designed to affect exporters in provinces such as Lova, which back Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Frattat, the former US ambassador to China and long-time governor of Lovato, is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, saying Beijing has caused distress to American workers, farmers and businesses.
Frasdatt wrote an article in the Sunday's Des Monies Register, in which he said that "the threat to trade is increasing with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our own media."
"China's government is taking advantage of the United States' heritage of protected freedom of speech and media freedom by placing a money-making ad on the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda," he said.
"On the contrary, you will see the distinctly different voices on the newsstand on Beijing Street and the true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's complex economic displacement, which means that the media operates under the thumbs of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
"One of China's most important newspapers rejected the offer to publish it," he wrote in his article, but did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republicans lose women's vote in by-elections due to the Kevanov scandal, analysts warn
A number of prominent Republicans have backed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and are trying to protect him so that they will face a setback, especially in the upcoming by-elections, analysts have warned.
The emotional turmoil over the incident is at an all-time high, and the official statement of many Republicans shows that they are already willing to go along with their plan for the vote.
Such things cannot be changed," said Grant Reher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Reher has said he suspects Senator Jeff Blake (R-Arizona) is rushing them to the FBI at the last minute to pacify angry voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, "Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget tomorrow, and they're not going to forget November," Karen Jean Pierre, senior adviser to the Progressive Party Movement and national spokesperson, said Friday.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Kristen Blasey Ford, the protesters shouted in the hallway of the legislature on Friday morning, saying, "November is coming!" as Republicans control the Judiciary Committee to choose whether to release the alleged kawakan.
"Democracy interest and motivation is going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is not part of the political group.
"People say it's too much already; it's true.
But this time could be much higher, especially among female voters living in suburbs where the president is unpopular and often unelectable, and young female voters between the ages of 18 and 29."
Analysts have suggested that Republicans could face a backlash if they continue with affirmative action, even before Ford has detailed his accusation of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee in public.
According to NBC News, "this is a disturbing situation for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kevanov will be punished, it's about how the Republicans are handling it and how they're treating him," Briarty's USA director Guy Cecil told the news channel.
However, Americans who have changed their minds because of the testimony of Ford and Kevanov may change their minds at the time of the election.
In a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41 percent of respondents said they definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kevanov's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that Kevanov would have lied most or most certainly during his testimony, while 30 percent said Ford probably or most certainly would have lied during his testimony.
After the crisis, the FBI is now investigating the charges against Ford and another accused, Dipora Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee last week that he had been harassed by Kevanov Drunkenley at the age of 17.
Ramirez has alleged that Kevanov, a Supreme Court nominee, went to a party with her in the 1980s while she was studying in Yale and showed her genitals to him.
In order to compete with Google and Facebook, the inventor of World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of Tech Legends is the company that makes Solid, which is Berners-Lee's open source platform.
It allows users to choose where their data can be stored and to whom it can be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners-Lee joked that "global domination" was the motive behind the invasion.
"We have to do it now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
The app, which uses Solid's technology, allows people to create their own personal online data storage, or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's available in one browser and all at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify.
The uniqueness of personal online data storage is that the user decides who should have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal development through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Intel is to bring the resources, process, and relevant skills that make Solid accessible to everyone.
To work on the project, the company currently has a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some contract developers, and a code-writing volunteer community.
Earlier this week, tech developers from around the world were able to create their own web-based apps using tools available on the IntelliJ IDEA website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "have not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a technique that will completely change business models overnight."
"We didn't ask their permission."
In a post posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Intel's mission is to "provide professional energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Internet creation on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the web neutral debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I have no doubt about this next web era," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Celebration
During World War I, the only Church of England Cleric to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Commander Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vane won the award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellengills and Lehigh Court.
However, four days after the award-winning, he was killed by a man who was secretly shooting, so no one knew he had received the prestigious award of the British Army.
The commemorative postage stamp was unveiled by two of his grandsons at a parade in RUSHTEN, NORTH AFRICA, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michelle Wan, said it was a "wonderful code" medal that emerged exactly 100 years after her grandfather's award-winning year.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vane led his regiment in Colonel de Saint-Quintin's "between thick snow and field, and the fierce firing from the guns."
He then hurriedly moved from the firing line, leading his brigade with "wonderful avalanche" of fighting with a gun in one hand before doing so, attacking three battle groups.
General von der Leyen was shot dead by a German man in hiding on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "some things that I know will be very good things that I will never be able to practice in my life, but some that will be very modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, laid a wreath of flowers after the parade ended, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he "feels very proud to be participating in the parade," and added that the brave warriors are still going to be revealed with the support of a lot more people.
MMA fans have been waiting all night to see the Peppa Pig.
Imagine an environment like this, where you've been up all night watching the main show, exactly the Packed Feather 206 main fight isn't broadcast.
There are 13 fights in San Jose's bill that include six fights that come on the main card, with Channel 5 being shown live all night in the UK.
At 6 a.m., Keygard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to clash with each other, and the coverage suddenly shifted to Peppa Pig, which shocked viewers in the UK.
Those who had been waiting for this morning were disappointed.
A fan had tweeted the children's cartoon being screened as a "frightening joke" on Twitter.
"It's a government regulation that a show that airs at 6 a.m. should be suitable for kids to watch or else not to air, so they switched to a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Pelator.
"Buffy the dog, yes."
The company's CEO Scott Koecker said the company will work to keep a schedule of events for future UK visitors.
"When I think about broadcasting again, I think I can do it right," Koker said.
"But we can't do that until we get there at six o'clock on Sunday morning, and then it'll be Monday for them."
But we are still trying.
Trust me, there were a lot of text messages when the show changed, and they weren't very good.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
This is not a technical problem, it is a government problem.
I promise that won't happen next time.
We put up five fights instead of six fights - this is what we usually do - and we tried to give more to the fans, and that's why we increased the number of fights.
This is an unexpected event."
Tom Daley on 'self-deception' over sexism
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley has said that he grew up feeling low because of his sexuality, but that's what inspired him to win.
The 24-year-old said he learned after going to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs provided by Lauren Laverne, the player spoke about male homosexual rights in order to "trust" others.
He also said that parents should be concerned about their children's success in the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, is on leave for a few months due to ill health.
Participating in Laverne's first show as a swimmer, Daley said she considered herself "less" than everyone else because "men like men and women like women is socially unacceptable" when she grew up.
He added: “Today, the feelings that make me feel less important to myself, and the different feeling will be the real things that give me the energy and the power to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he had "something talent," so it didn't hurt himself when others found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze-medallist is a celebrity who actively campaigned in support of LGBT, using his visit to the Commonwealth Games this year to demand that more countries inform that homosexuality is not legally wrong.
"I'm happy that I was able to live openly without fear and because I wanted to give hope to others," he said.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with the American film director Dustin Black - and met him in 2013 - "falling in love with the look."
Last year, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, and age was no different, he said.
"When you experienced so many weights and drawbacks as a child - the first time you participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later your father died of cancer - it would be hard to find someone my age who has experienced such heights and mortality," he said.
The couple became parents in June and named their son Robert Ray Black-Dale, who has since changed his "whole perspective."
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said, 'I want to win a gold medal.'
"You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> shared that he did not believe his father was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if he had got tickets because he wanted to watch the 2012 London Olympics in the front row.
"I can't wait to see you sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was holding his last breath, not only until he was actually holding his last breath, but even after he died, I realized that in the end we could not conquer death and I accepted his death," he said.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> competed in the 2012 Olympics, the year after his father's death, and won a bronze medal.
"I have a dream in my entire life - that I have to dive into the Olympics in front of a crowd of local fans and there is no greater joy than that," he said.
This is why Heather Small was so proud of the first song that inspired her - the song that inspired her when she participated in the Olympic Games and is still grinning.

Mikelson did not play in Saturday's Ryder Cup
When he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, American Bill Mickelson will set a record, but he will have to return to his form if he wants to make the record a happy one.
Mickelson, who has been playing for the last two years, is set to set a record for the 12th time in a row, having not been picked up by captain Jim Furyk for the Four Balls and Foursoms on Saturday.
Known as a player for America and a five-time major winner, he was the team promoter of his day, instead of being the main contender, and was also working to fix his problem and play the match better.
The 48-year-old, who has not taken a single straight drive shot despite his peak, is not very good for the Tiede Lee Golf National Course, where long-range shots are a miss.
And if the ground is left alone, it won't be that difficult, as Mickelson will face British Open champion Francisco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with Rookie Tommy Flitwood to win all four of this week's matches.
With the U.S. team falling four points short of 12 singles, it would be a good start to singles, so Mickelson's competition would be a very important one.
Furyk has said he has confidence in him, although he has not spoken further on the matter.
"He fully understood the responsibility given to him today, took full responsibility and put his hand on me and said he was ready for tomorrow's match," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in him.
He is very talented and he has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it turned out just as well.
Like everyone else, he wanted to be there."
Mickelson is set to break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may be his final match for the Ryder Cup, which doesn't entirely match his personal record highs.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, but his presence gives the team a little extra strength.
"He's fun, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny and he's funny when he's in the team room," she said.
"I think the young players are going to have fun with him and there were fun activities to watch out for this week too.
He taught me a lot about the game."
European captain Thomas Paine has said that the big lead will soon be gone.
European captain Thomas Paine has said that from his experience, the big lead from yesterday's singles match in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unsatisfactory ride.
Dan first made his debut in 1997 at Vulderrama, when Save Pelestros was captain, five points ahead of the Americans, although the match ended in a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
In Friday's and yesterday's games, after seeing Leigh win the Class of 2018, 5-3, at the Lee Golf National, he said, "We got a big lead at Vulderama; we got a big lead at Brooklyn, here we lost and won at Vulterrama, keep in mind that this is the truth."
So history will remember me and everyone in the team, it's not over yet.
We need to make full use of tomorrow.
Do your best and do the right thing.
This is not possible until the required data is available.
Our goal is to win this tournament and that's the only thing we'll focus on.
I have been saying this from the beginning, I am focusing on the 12 players on our side and at the same time I am aware of the other side, the best players in the opposition."
"I'm glad to see my players playing on a tough golf course," he said, "I'm not going to let them do what I can."
Tomorrow's game will be different.
Everyone's talent should be brought to light in tomorrow's match, and that's a different thing we have to do.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you'll test your full potential as a golfer.
You will have to give this information to the players and show them your full potential tomorrow.
Let him play, let him play, and let him play to his fullest potential."
In contrast to Bayonne, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to play better when they play separately, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was on both ends of yesterday's unexpected big changes as Europe won as he performed a "miracle at Medina" and thus was on the winning team at Brookline before Furyk ended up as a loser.
When Ben Crenshaw was asked how he performed as a captain in 1999, who had kept his players together on the final day, he replied, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, and I want to give you a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When the momentum is pushed in the same direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
"We're going to play our best football, we're going to play our best football tomorrow and we're going to play our best football."
Thomas is tasked with trying to succeed, and he meets Roli McIlroy in the top flight with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Flitwood, another top half liner, Ian Poulter, and other Europeans.
"I've played with people in this lineup, and I think it's going to lead to success all the way," Pione said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again
The new cannon was supposed to replace the old Cold War-era warships in the German fleet in 2014, but it won't be until next year due to faulty configurations and price increases, local media said.
A military spokesman said the delivery of the Rainland-Falz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper reported.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014 but due to post-delivery issues, the project got delayed.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class warships.
They include an organized array of potent artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and steel technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and sound navigation.
Another important aspect includes long-term maintenance - the possibility of not becoming one even if the new warships are kept away from local ports for up to two years.
However, due to a series of delays, the advanced warships would expire by the time they have already entered service abroad, a lesson for Germany to assess the capability of the foreign countries.
When a German naval officer refused to use the warship and returned it to the Lom and Was Shipyard in Hamburg, the F125 was headlined as a "lucky warship" last year.
This is the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to the company that made it.
The reasons for the repatriation were little known, although German media reported that the warship had a number of important "hardware and software flaws" and that military action would make the warship useless.
Since the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors, the software flaws were so significant that the number of these sailors was only half the crew on the older Bremen-type warships.
Moreover, the ship was under too much weight to reduce its performance, and the navy was on the verge of not being able to add improvements to the ship in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rainland-Falz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the heavy-duty warships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project including the training of the shipping task force also becomes an issue.
This is said to have risen to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion initially stated.
In view of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling, the problems with the new warships have become increasingly important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, as chair of the German Parliamentary Detention Committee, admitted that the number of "marine-usable ships" was limited.
The problem is increasing day by day as the old ships are becoming unusable and no new ships are being provided as a substitute, the official said.
Unfortunately, none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are eligible to join the fleet.
The National Trust, which monitors the secret life of bats
New research is being launched on an estate in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of uncovering how bats use land to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings of the study will provide new information on the functioning of unique flying mammals and help in future conservation measures.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland are researching the common and soprano bibistrels and brown long-eared bats and the daubendon bats that live in the Indrevi Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at important locations across the forest where bats live, to monitor their activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use hand-held detectors to perform surveys on mobiles.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what the organism is doing.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to create an image detailing their activity on the landscape.
Rap Dewar, NTS's natural protection adviser, said the results will reveal what areas are important to bats in their habitat and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine how best to care for habitat management benefits, such as grassland formation, bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by the building and development work that affects the bird's habitat, as well as by loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting pose a threat, and pest - killing paper and certain chemicals in building materials and attacks by domesticated cats pose a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, they use their ears more than their eyes to catch prey as they search for food at night.
They use intelligent echo location technology to identify insects and obstructions on their flight path.
The NTS is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It consists of ten trained experts who carry out surveys, surveys in meadows and sometimes in rescue operations.
The company has set up Scotland's first and only bat-designated protection at Three Estate in Dumfries and Keloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says the estate is a great place for bats.
"We have a great place for bats here in the trivet," he said.
"We have old buildings, more old trees and a good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, and the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what bats need to thrive."
He emphasizes that it is very important to check for bats before undertaking maintenance work inside buildings, as single meadows can destroy the ground, causing the death of 400 female bats and younger bats, which can destroy almost the entire species.
Bats are protected and it is a crime to kill, harass, disturb, or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferral, the Scottish officer for the Wauwatosa Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He added: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many of our natural species, and we don’t know how their numbers are declining.”
Ronaldo's lawyers are suing the German newspaper for refusing to comment on allegations of rape
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and his lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which used his name to "want others to popularize him."
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news," saying he used his name to "want others to popularize him."
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorka, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Dare Spiegel reported that he agreed to pay him $375,000 to avoid any trouble over the incident.
Hours after the news of the claims surfaced, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on an Instagram live video, which he called "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news," Ronaldo, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, said in front of the camera.
They want to use my name.
This is usual.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's their job.
"I'm very happy that everything is going well," he said.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue him over the allegations, calling it "unacceptable to publish suspicious news on personal matters."
It could also be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years, and the player could be seeking damages for "moral reputation losses associated with a serious violation."
The alleged incident is alleged to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas and the Suite in Caseina.
According to documents provided to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorka reportedly went to Ronaldo's room and raped him there.
Cristiano Ronaldo apologized for the incident, saying he was "99 percent a good man" and "one percent a mistake."
According to the documents, Ronaldo has said that the two of them had sex, but this was done with the consent of both parties.
Mayorka has said that she went to the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, where she later admitted to the settlement held outside the court because she was "terrified by the attack" and worried about being "adorned in public."
34-year-old Mayorka says she is looking for a way to avoid the settlement as she continues to be mentally injured due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at Manchester United's Real Madrid club at the time of the alleged rape, and joined the Italian giants Juve this summer on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
The UK's exit from the EU: 'If we lose car manufacturers, the UK will always have to be sad'
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it loses its position as a world leader in car production after the UK leaves the European Union.
Toyota has told the BBC it is "painful" that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily halt production at its factory in Barnastaan, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has warned that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it could lead to job losses.
The Parnanasta manufacturing facility, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvi Cooke, executive director of Barnanasta Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about leaving the EU without knowing how the deal on cross-border business will work.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Oxford-based small-scale factory a month after Britain's departure from the European Union.
One of the biggest problems for car manufacturers is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be supply chain issues.
Toyota's production system runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts for cars ordered for production coming from suppliers in both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, the border could be disrupted, causing industry delays and problems with access to parts.
Toyota has said it will stop production if it can only keep more than a day's supply at its plant in Derbyshire.
Mr Clarke and Theresa May's experimental plan for future relations with the EU will be "measured precisely to avoid such tests at the border."
"We have to make a deal. We have to have a better deal, which means it's not just a win that we're going to enjoy right now, it's going to be an opportunity that we're always going to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"What Toyota and other car manufacturers need is for them to be able to keep up with the successful supply chains they've had in the past."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs could reduce the company's competitiveness and result in the loss of jobs.
Peter D'Souzawallaris, who has been working at Barnanasta for 24 years, is a unit union convener at the factory, and he is increasingly afraid of his teammates: "In my experience, once these jobs leave us, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have recommended an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House has said that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
As the case of Supreme Court nominee Fred Kavanagh continues, Donald Trump's highly tense meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for another week," the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the possibility of interference in the presidential judiciary.
Although Trump did not fire or fire the vice-presidential official, it was the result of Mueller's obstruction of freedom that caused months of talk in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
However, on Monday, he announced that he was leaving the White House.
Instead, it was announced to hold a meeting on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't" remove Rosenstein, but later, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which testified by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with the investigation.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Gavana, delaying a full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's secretary of state, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set and it may be this week, but considering all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, it seems that it may be postponed for another week."
But we will see, I want to be able to tell [the story] and I want to be able to tell [it].”
Some journalists will only object to the idea: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chrissy Teigen asked why.
Sanders said that the reason he rarely held a press conference was not because of the way television journalists "appreciated others," but: "I don't deny that they do it just to be praised."
He added that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the media.
'The president attends more Q&A sessions than any president before him,' he said, without citing sources: 'We also counted the numbers.'
Sanders said he would hold more brief press conferences and told reporters that "if I had the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it would be better for me to speak to him than for ever."
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it's going to take the place of a press conference."
Trump usually responds to reporters when he leaves the White House or when he attends open-air meetings or when he meets with foreign dignitaries.
It is very rare to have a press conference.
In New York this week, perhaps the president would have made an unconventional and bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters, and shown why.
The Secretary of State for Health writes a letter to EU workers in Scotland about the fears of a Brexit conference
The Secretary of State for Health has written a letter of thanks to the country's EU staff working on the NHS in Scotland, expressing his desire to remain with them after the Brexit conference.
Jean Freeman MSP wrote a letter, less than six months before the UK's departure from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already agreed to bear the cost of the application for asylum for EU citizens employed in the public sector services it has developed.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman said: "There have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal during the summer and it is moving towards the expected results this autumn.
However, the UK government and the EU have been slow to take the necessary steps to address the situation.
I know this is going to be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize at this time how much I value the contribution made by each and every employee, irrespective of their nationality.
The employees who come from all over the EU, who work with me, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system, and benefit the patients and communities in which we work.
"Scotland is your home, and of course we want you to stay with us."
Christian Aubergromby suffered a head injury and is undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit
Mike Organ of the Tennessee State Tigers said the forward, Christian Aubergromby, received treatment in the emergency department after he suffered a head injury after losing Sunday's game to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
The Tennessee State coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the side of the road and somehow got stuck there," Reed said.
Before he was brought to the surface, the coaches and medical staff brought him to Abercrombie for oxygen analysis.
An official from the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that there was no need for Aubergrombe to have surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was no "type/quantitative detail" of the injury, and that the Tennessee State team was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student in a red shirt, Abercrombie was playing in his first season with the Tennessee State team after moving from Illinois.
He had five interceptions on Saturday to get out of the game, including a total of 18 interceptions this season.
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged a higher registration fee.
In order to help the homeless with the extra money available under the new Tory schemes, foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher bond registration fee.
This move will make Carbone's effort to attract young voters nothing short of
The tax increase will apply to non-citizens in the UK.
The U.S. Treasury expects this figure to increase by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that the public who buy property in the UK will have to pay a higher bond registration fee - the extra money that will help the homeless.
This step was taken by Jeremy Corbyn to nullify the success of his bid to attract young voters and target high-income groups.
The increase in the registration fee will be levied only on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will give impetus to the government's efforts to fight the sleepless situation.
Additional tax - This is in addition to the current registration fee, which includes additional taxes levied on second home buyers two years ago and on home buyers on rent, which can be more than three per cent.
The government is expected to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
The estimated 13 percent of new London properties are bought by non-residents in England, making them more difficult for first-time homebuyers.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital city - have often become "mad cities" because most of the buyers are foreigners and spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the registration fee to help most young adults buy their first home.
He accused the big corporations of holding the land and raising the rent by not using it, and urged Mrs May to abolish the quota for affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing woes."
Mr Garbine has put forward a series of housing reforms to the extent that they are eye-catching, including rent controls and an end to "mistakes" and "no evictions."
He also wants to give more powers to the fora to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said that I would dedicate my leadership to fulfilling the British dream - that life should be a special one for every new generation.
We need to reform the housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be correct to say that it will be as easy for non-UK residents as it is for foreign-based companies and hard-working UK residents.
For most people, the dream of owning a house has become a reality, and sleeping on the streets without a home has become a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "top goal" is to become Scotland's manager on the same platform.
The Scott, 42, has taken on the life-changing challenge of North-East Club, who, for now, are third in the League One, three points away from the top.
Last season, after guiding St Mirren back to Scottish leadership, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I love playing for my country.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross said at BBC SportSource in Scotland.
"But I grew up watching a lot of Scottish games in Hampton with my dad, and that's what brought me here anyway.
I'll only be able to do that if I'm successful."
His predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Boyett and Palo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletics chairman had previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ibswich, saying he had no hesitation in following such established names in such a large club.
"The measure of success for me right now is 'Can I go back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the infrastructure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly a part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but if I can get back to the club, I'll see that I'm a winner."
Rose has only served three years in her management role, after a brief stint as vice-president in Dumbarton and 15 months as Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Allova progress from the lowest to the third tier, and transformed Saint Mirren from being the lowest, to winning the championship title the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was when he was playing at Glide, Hartleypool, Falkirk, Saint Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
When asked about taking responsibility for Alloah, he recalls, "Maybe it was real cross-roads."
"I thought it was better to play than to play.
This may seem strange, because I played quite well, lived a good life, and had a fairly high standard of living.
But it can be hard to play.
There is a lot of work to be done on a weekly basis.
I still feel the same way about work and life, but when it comes to managing it, it seems to be okay.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing the same, which is the most comfortable thing I can do, and I'm able to do my job with ease throughout my adult life."

The summer heatwaves have rattled Britains faltering wineries, but they have put more strain on restaurants.
Sales in bars and restaurants increased by 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, the data showed.
Compiling the figures, Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Group said: "Continuous heat, with England's longer-than-expected participation at the World Cup, created the same posture as the previous June, when sales in bars increased by 2.8 percent, but sales in restaurants continued to deteriorate.
Restaurant sales fell 1.8% in June, and in July, even worse.
The food, drinks, and beverages were all good, and the food was even better.
The food and drink stalls were also heavily affected by the sun, but not as inverted as those who run the restaurants.
It seems that people are turning to alcohol.
"In all managed wine shops and bars, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in sales this month, including a three per cent drop in food sales."
RSM Entertainment and Hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue to show the same trend we’ve seen since late April.
When it comes to the home-out-of-foods market, the biggest factors are the climatic conditions and the impact of large-scale community or sports events.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to slide, but a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop is particularly painful in the ongoing cost crisis.
It's time to tell whether a long hot summer, a food-and-mortar summer, should not have come at the worst of times for the restaurant operators, and whether the moderate temperatures we had in August will give them much-needed relief."
Total sales growth in bars and restaurants across the country, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in new brand releases.
The industry watchdog for the UK's bars, bars and restaurants, Cafer Beach Tracker, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the only established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account without the knowledge of their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - have social media accounts without the knowledge of their parents and Asian peers.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "fake insta" pages increased.
This increased the fear that they were posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show off to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - have created social media accounts secretly without the knowledge of adults.
A poll of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to Instagram, a photo-sharing website.
This is further exacerbated by the fear of sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account to show to their parents, while also having private accounts.

Ellie Doyle will be the "Voice for Athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eliot Doyle was elected non-administrative director of the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Board's Annual General Meeting.
"Toilet is Scotland's most popular athlete, and head Ian Beatty said, ""Over the last decade, it's been a wonderful opportunity to benefit from his varied experience at the international level."""
"Eileen has great respect in Scotland, England and across the athletics community, and bringing him to the board is sure to benefit the athletes in Scotland," Beatty said.
Toiley said: "I'm determined to be a voice for athletes and I'm sure I can contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."

He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldnt walk.
Only time will tell how long I will be able to recover.
It was a terrible training, but he has fully recovered, he has learned how to walk again, and today he is doing his fast-return training!
Thank you for these great reminders.”
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows has sparked an online debate.
A breast pump manufacturer has created an online controversy by comparing breast - feeding mothers with breast - feeding cows.
While introducing the "world's first silent-wearing breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad in a tung-in-cheek video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
In it, four mothers dance to the music in a straw-laden cowshed, with the following lyrics: "Aang, I'm milking the cow, the tail has no tail", "Let's see the tail, it's not the lap, it's my breasts"
The refrain continues: “Slaves, my kinsmen, I give milk to my children, I give milk to my women.”
However, the company's announcement on Facebook caused a furore.
The video, viewed by 77,000 people and receiving hundreds of comments, received mixed reactions from viewers, calling it a mockery of the dairy sector's "hotspots."
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
To give milk, she, like us, must conceive and give birth to a calf, and the only difference is that they go to Kalavadi within a few days of giving birth to their calves," one writes.
The Elvee breast pump fits perfectly within the breast-feeding range (the Elve/Mother)
He said: “It’s a terrible thing to have to deal with, and it’s a terrible punishment.
Why do they not use their children as a means to help themselves and their families?”
He said: “It’s a no-brainer.
Some of the people who bought it said that it was a "smart" purchase.
"This is a wise idea.
If I had bought one, I would have bought one.
The smell of milk made me feel like a pig.
It was a bit of a bummer, but I took what I was told.
It's a smart production."
Another said: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who are milking (mostly in the workplace or in the toilets) and it looks like 'cows'.
"This is not an endorsement of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, all of them are seen dancing with their hands in the air.
The theme behind the campaign is that many women who milk milk through the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvey pump is completely silent and does not have any wires or tubes, and it fits neatly inside the breast milk bottle, allowing women to move freely, have children, and even go out for milking.
At the Mother Institute, partner and ECD, Ana Palerin, says: "This Elvey pump is a very revolutionary product that deserves a bold and angry introduction.
By highlighting the similarities between lactating women and lactating cows, we wanted to bring to light breastfeeding and all its challenges, while also enabling it to be entertaining and, to a comparable extent, the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump offers.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has been in the headlines.

While the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be reunited with their supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants, and are afraid that their right to remain in the country will be eroded by their acceptance of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that patrons and the elderly in their homes would be required to register their fingerprints and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department, announced in parliament that he had arrested several people who had applied for help to support underprivileged young people.
The agency later said that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are supporters or family members of the supporter are here illegally in this country, and the vast majority of them are involved in criminal conduct.
"We're looking for them," said Mr. Allen.
While seeking detailed action on children, some of them introduced new rules requiring them to come to court within one month of their arrest, instead of the standard 60 days previously prescribed for slum workers.
Most people appear in court through a video conference call rather than going directly to an immigration judge in a case seeking legal status.
Those who do not comply will be deported immediately.
According to tent staff and reports coming out of the computer system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous and stressed, leading to acts of hysteria or attempts to escape.
Such concerns are more prevalent in large centres such as Tornillo, where the size is so large that a distraught child is more likely to miss the signs.
Taking children to the tent city without giving them enough time to mentally prepare and even reply to their friends can be a waste of time.
The Syrian government has called on the US, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their "invasive forces."
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawlam called for the return of Syrian refugees, even in the eighth year of the country's war.
Maulam, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces, under the guise of fighting terrorism, are illegal on Syrian soil and that it "will be dealt with in an appropriate manner."
"They should leave immediately and unconditionally," he said.
He also said the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He added that the "sacred war" will continue "until all terrorists are wiped out" by terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily involved in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops.
In the case of refugees, Mr. Maulam said the situation was such that they were able to return home, blaming some "superseded countries" and "spreading fear without reason" for the refugees' non-return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to arrange for the return of the refugees," he said.
"It's a political issue that needs to be addressed."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance for Chirac unless Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
UN officials say Russia and Turkey's recent agreement to establish a non-war zone in the last city held by the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to emphasize political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoids a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region of three million people.
However, Maulam insisted that the agreement had a "clear timeline," and hoped that the military operations would target only the holy fighters, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and "destroy them."
UN Ambassador Stephen de Mistura expressed hope that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria would be held soon, paving the way for elections.
Maulam also warned against interference, imposing conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the group, saying that the task of the committee should be limited to "reviewing the current provisions of the constitution."
Why did Trump win the election?
According to that argument, Mr. Trump himself will win the re-election in 2020, unless, perhaps, the LTTE audience thinks, he ends his presidency prematurely with condemnation and corruption.
Without a doubt, “the most inverted final ever before the presidency!”
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's to 1.6 million, nearly tripled.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" with 3.5 million viewers has gone to the forefront of cable ratings on major news nights.
After an attack toppled the capital, a cabinet secretary said of the president, "It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, who runs the ABC drama "Designated Survivor."
Nell Schowell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and a Feu hard truths about snoring into the Hollywood Boys" club, has another theory
He said he had been in a car accident prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told Mr. Trump that he was going to vote for them.
Why? he asked.
"He said, ""Because he makes me laugh,"" Mrs. Scoville told me."
It's so much fun and entertainment.
"More than anything on TV, the narrative from Washington, Roe v. Wade, will determine their future, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the world's economy.
This is a very rare event that can only be attended by the most experienced people.
Still, you know that Bob Woodwards brought the word "deep background" to his book "Pear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber vest ("It's a hat with a thick cloth" - the Washington Post said) and Mr. Trump's comments on Stormy Daniels, a panel of experts that you'll see when you turn your face to.
For some reason, I don't see Super Mario in the same way.
When asked about the spin-off performance of Trump's play and the daily storylines (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), he said, "Part of what he's doing is making it look like it's happening in real life, because he's giving you something every night."
You can't watch a show, or you'll fall behind.
When I went to see Mr. Flyce, the sun was shining 80 degrees outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was filming CNN and was lying in the house watching the MSNBC show.
He couldn't take his eyes off it, and neither did he see Fred Cavana, who is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, nor does he see the Supreme Court's future swinging.
"I remember when we were taking such rabid scenes and people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true."

Money flows out of the most difficult by-elections.
It should come as no surprise that the money flow to Pennsylvania's 17th district has been redefined by Congress to allow two incumbents to run for the same office.
This recently redefined suburban Pittsburgh district, representative of the Democratic Party. Conor Lamb stops them <0xE2><0x80><0x93> he won one seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another already incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, most of which is in the new 17th district.
Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally drafted the maps in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district is a fierce campaign finance race between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) funding sources of the major political party.
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a popular March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
A Republican has held the seat for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a light-hearted lead.
The U.S. wanted to penalize El Salvador for its support of China.
Ambassadors point out that with some support from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump held an amicable meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in 2017 and until the shareholders expelled the Trump Foundation’s executive team, he had a hotel in Panama.
In a statement earlier this month, State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said state officials had decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan."
But the fines were intended to only be imposed against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in the US in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The fines include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, which could have a severe impact on this Central American country, its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting that focused on security and economic growth to follow a similar meeting last year, seen as an attempt to curb the influx of immigrants towards the US.
But by mid-September, top management had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, putting an end to plans to impose any fines on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the meeting, a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, a diplomat said.
In addition, the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh news or punishments.
Mr Bolton, a White House spokesman for the three US officials, declined to comment on the details of the discussion, including the two who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the condition that the name not be released.
Their accounts were examined and confirmed by an external analyst, who was very close to the administration and spoke on condition that his name not be released.
the history of research
The next cat may have been a statement by Robert Mueller, the special counsel to whom Mr. Trump has shunned justice, and for now, there is very strong evidence in the government register.
"Mr. Mueller is likely to turn his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign engaged in covert co-operation with Russia's attacks on our elections.
If the Congress party is changing, as he prepares to go to the voters, and ultimately to a judge like him, Mr. Trump himself will have to take responsibility for the organization.
There are a lot of g-spots in it, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall - or the downfall of his equivalents in Europe - is inevitable.
In the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler only if the Western days turned against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, so we missed the opportunity to save the lives of the tens of thousands that followed.
It is in places of such fluctuations that the course of history changes, where the tide of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Today, the United States faces many such challenges.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who would be in control of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the report's publication, Rosenthin had been pouring water on their feet, advising the president to secretly investigate and register, predicting that he would be disqualified from office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times's account is inaccurate.
"What would we say if the newly-invited F.B.I. investigation into Fred Kavanaugh was not completely or fair - or despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony, he was confirmed by the Supreme Court?"
Are we going to vote for them in the by-elections to keep Mr. Trump in cages?
If we fail to do so, democracy will be destroyed.
But because of what I've learned in Paraguay, I don't think we'll let it go.
My mother, a Czechoslovakian Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that took him away from the home of my foreign ambassador.
He survived and emigrated to the United States, where, 60 years later, he sent the Holy Day candle to be lit on a table with the swastika symbol.
Is there any way for me to be able to follow my own path, and be able to follow my own path?

"Rangers' Graham Dorrance has been a positive thinker ahead of the Rapid Vienna clash
Following a massive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League from Group G.
The Rangers believe that a knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance from playing in the centrefield from his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he could use the result as a driving force for much greater success.
"For us, it's a good thing because the Villarreals are good players," the 31-year-old said.
"We played well and we thought we had a chance to win.
Maybe we've hit a bit at the end, and overall, the draw was a fair bit of a draw.
They may have played well in the first half, but in the second half we took the game and became the better side.
It's going to be another big week for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I think we can put some pressure on the crowd to be on our side and get a positive result.
Between all my injuries last year and the changes at the club, it was certainly tough, but it's a good thing for the place right now.
The staff is very nice and the kids are very friendly and the training is very good.
We are confident that we will be able to overcome the challenges ahead and we will be successful.
Women fall asleep in fear of these retirement savings
Some have even spoken to their family members about the fact that the poll participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves.
More than half of those surveyed said they spoke with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
“People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about it,” says Halle Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not tell them your wishes in time, you will not be able to prepare your family.
Plan with your counselor and your family to discuss where to get the care, since such choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also come up with ways in which you can pay for such expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care include a traditional long-term care insurance plan, a hybrid cash-value insurance plan to cover costs, or self-insure your own assets as long as you have money.
Make a decision on your legal documents: put an end to the legal battles.
Hire someone who will take care of your health care instead, such as a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that the experts are supervising your wishes when you are unable to speak.
Also, write a letter of recommendation to check your financial situation.
Choose someone who is trustworthy to make financial decisions for you and pay for your expenses when you are unable to.
Don't forget the little details too: Imagine your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Can you tell us about the medications and treatments you are taking?
Make sure you have these in writing so that you are prepared.
“Finance alone is not important, but who are the doctors and who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?"
Who will take care of the dog?
You have a plan."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise.
The relief authorities were unable to obtain any information from Dongala, which is in the north of the city of Palu, close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In the city of Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are the important facts about the Balu and Dongala areas on the island of Sulawesi:
Balu Nagar is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Region, located at the end of the narrow Gulf on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
Today marks the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami in Haiti.
Dongla is a region stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The province is an administrative region with a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Tongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated on Morovali, the opposite side of Sulawesi Island.
According to Indonesia's disaster relief agency, Palu and Tonga have been hit by multiple tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than 100 homes in Dongla.
In 1996, a tsunami hit western Dongala, killing nine people.
According to the geological system, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
December 26, 2004: A massive earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province strikes 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the Aceh region.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of strong aftershocks hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, just off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 - A 6.8-magnitude earthquake strikes the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, triggering a tsunami that ravaged the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009 - A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Menda<0xC3><0xAF> islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying more than 12 villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: In Aceh, a small earthquake struck the Beedi Jaya region, causing destruction and devastation, as people remember the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people died in the building collapse.
2018 - A massive earthquake strikes the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the north of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and destroyed thousands of homes.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Ballin is the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who has been arrested on felony charges.
According to a statement issued by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Pauline, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and on suspicion of interfering with the domestic violence report and preventing arrest.
According to the police report, he snatched her phone from her when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime.
The KTUU reports that Pauline has been detained at the Made-Soo Pretrial Prison and is being held in a $500 unsecured network.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his appeal, he declared, "He certainly did not commit any crime."
Ball is facing three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $250,000.
He has also been charged with Class B wrongdoings, which can result in one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time he has been accused of sex crimes.
In December 2017, she was accused of beating her father, Todd Polly.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to inform them that he had been beaten.
The case is currently pending in Alaska's former District Court.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence charge sheet, and possessing poison in her hand while intoxicated.
He accused his friend of punching him in the face.
A group of ex-servicemen harshly criticized Sarah Palin's son in 2016 after he was linked to PTSD and removed from the force in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: Death toll mounts to 100
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
While the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days, electricity and communication networks have been cut off.
The quake struck just outside the Indonesian capital, Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta.
Videos of the incident have gone viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu to celebrate the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty to be rarely awarded to anyone suspected of involvement in the NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment not given in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, has been accused of using a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on pedestrians and cyclists in October on a bike lane on the western side of the highway in Lower Manhattan.
If the death penalty is to be justified, prosecutors must prove that Tsaipov "intentionally" killed those eight men and caused "intentional" serious bodily injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, which he completes in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both men could face the death penalty.
In the weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts of murder, including the systematic use of federal prosecutors in well-planned criminal cases, violence, and vandalism.
Prosecutors said the attack required "extreme planning and deep thinking," describing how Saipov staged this "horrific, cruel and evil" act.
“Saifullo Habibullevik Cypov, injury, harm, and injury to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleeves, On-Lare Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Paganak<0xC3><0xA1>ko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been on death row for more than a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually commuted to life imprisonment and sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been married for two years before being convicted of spying and conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, Rosenbergs was executed by electrocution.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel sorry for the attack in the days and months following it.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment documents, Saipov told authorities that he was eager to carry out such attacks only after watching ISIS videos.
He asked the police to let him fly the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he did not see the 22-count indictment documents.
One of the federal government lawyers who argued for the tilt said the court's decision was "obviously painful."
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty will only prolong the agony of those events for all involved, rather than accept life imprisonment without any possibility of release," Patton said.
Earlier, a panel of lawyers had asked the government lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should put them in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Tory conference, vowed today to "make the people mobilize."
The former leader of the UK Freedom Party, from the harsh criticism emanating from the EU, said politicians should be 'hard-hit' - because Theresa May has said that one of her own MPs should be responsible for her negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, who is never in charge of the Conservative Party, told a rally in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, this time the UK would have been "out."
However, supporters of the Tories have underscored the challenge that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided leaders, joining a separate campaign against Brexit in the city.
The leader, amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainer supporters and the European Union, has been pacing his checkers' home reconciliation plan as planned.
Despite the political opposition, the allies insisted that he would go ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels - forcing EU critics and the Labour Party to choose his plans or 'disgrace'.
Mr Boon said he wanted to "throw out farmhouse projects" when he spoke at the 'Exit if exit' protest in Solihull.
He said Mr Farage should have made them more visible and given them the responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have come out this time," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit, but we have to throw out the farmhouse plans.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We have not waged world wars to silence dissent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn categorically denied that people's opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: 'It is completely untrue to say that the British people want to change their minds and remain in the EU.'
"Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Tory Brexit, told reporters: ""I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"The people who voted for our party, who are not popular with the public, who do not vote in favour of the opposition, who go to our party for its unpopularity and assimilation, are the ones who chose us first.
Please stop the farm projects and listen to the people.'
In a special message to Mrs May, he said, “The Prime Minister is doing his job when he fulfills his promises.”
Mr Farage, who was speaking at the rally, said that if they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 resolution, they should make the politicians "feel the crisis."
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class," he said.
"We are here today to tell you that they want to betray the decisions of the Brexit conference and we will not let you do that," he said.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want our political class, who are betraying the results of the Brexit conference, to feel the crisis.
"We, the people of this country, are mobilizing the forces that gave us the victory at the Brexit Conference, and we will never rest until we become a free, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Reigner supporters walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After launching the group this weekend, a small group of activists clapped and waved at the Tories against Brexit banners.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed Conservatives for a security issue at a party app during the opening of the conference.
"They're the ones who told the Information Technology Agency (IT) and the Canadian authorities that they're going to establish a friction-free border and a border-free Ireland for free trade," he said.
"This is totally fun.
"There's no such thing as a good product," he said.
Warren plans to "seriously think" about running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "think seriously about running for president" after the November elections.
According to The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall speech in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Teehl, who was Trump's 2016 co-leader of the Massachusetts campaign.
Many expected him to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting with members using the city council system since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was going to contest the presidential election.
Warren said: "The time has come for women to go to Washington and one woman to lead the way to fix our broken government."
Man arrested for shooting LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La-Z-Boy say they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Patton Row Police announced at a press conference at 11 a.m. ET that they had arrested Titian Simpson, 20.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
In the early hours of Friday, Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wyde Simps was stabbed in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
When he went to save his friend, Simpson shot him dead.
During questioning, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene and had a weapon and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without protest and taken into custody by the East Patton Row Parish Police.
Born and raised in Baton Rouge, the 6-foot-6-inch junior, Simps played 32 games last season with 10 starts, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the world title after the team was ordered to beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' command would play a big role in the game.
From the start, Pottas made a good start, almost repelling Hamilton in the first two rounds, retaining his position and attacking his teammate.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton to get stuck in traffic at the end of the pack, which must have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes later corrected themselves and followed Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after driving the wheels away, leaving Ferrari's driver in a double-move to protect the third corner, leaving the infield side undisturbed.
Max Verstappen, starting from the back row of Grid, was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then, after finishing the first ball and finishing the cart to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place, he led the bulk of the ball.
He eventually made it into the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed for the remaining eight rounds as Reikonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, because Vettori had done a fantastic job over the weekend, becoming a civilized man.
Hamilton said that the team has done an exceptional job of taking first and second place.
It's really an ugly body.
President Donald Trump has not leaked a letter from Senator Dionne Feinstein, accusing him of sexual harassment at a rally on Saturday, at his insistence, by his Supreme Court-appointed attorney, Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly cite Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead showed that the people in the Senate were "brutal, despicable, and unrealistic."
“One of the things that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is when you see anger, when you see people getting angry, merciless, despicable, and unrealistic,” he said.
"When you see releases and leaks, they'll say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I did not do it."
Do you remember ?
Dianne Feinstein, have you been leaking?
Remember his response... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disappear."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.," he said.
The letter came to Feinstein in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which were leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak had come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He kept it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
But his refusal did not leave a good impression on the president, about which he commented at Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what it is, it's really bad physical abuse.
He may not have done it, but it was really, the worst physical abuse I have ever seen.”
The president said the charges were used by the Democrats for their own benefit in order to defend the Supreme Court-appointed appointee, who has accused the three women of sexual misconduct.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
You've seen the hypocrisy, the derision, you don't care who they're hurting and who's going to step up and trample on to gain power and control.
Elite League: Dungy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
He scored two goals for the Windies in the first two games of the tournament
On Saturday, the Tunti Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in a rematch in Tunde.
The Giants got a two-goal lead initially from the bottom with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bevilleier scoring.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought the team's side to an equaliser before Twyer led the Giants back to the starting line-up.
Francis Bouchard equalized the Tundy team before two Lucas Lundald Nielsen goals were scored.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Kief's team, who were the ones to beat Tundy 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth game between the two sides, with the Giants winning all three previous games.
Dwyer's opening game came at 3:35 in the fourth minute, with one Kendall McFall from assists, with David Rutherford giving the assist, and Bevilleier doubling the lead four minutes later.
In a sensational opening, Sullivan brought his own team back into the game at 13:10, even before Matt Marquardt was able to help Kauni's balance goal at 15:16.
When he reached the end of the first half of the night, he saw the Giants coming to the fore in the first interval.
The home team once again got together, and Pachard scored a powerplay goal at 27:37 to level the table.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran, together, helped the team take the lead for the first time in the second half of the game, and saw their team reach the finals in the fifth half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games so far, will move on to their home town of Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
D<0xC3><0xAD>az, the air traffic controller, wants to make sure that hundreds of people on board survive the earthquake
In Indonesia, a traffic controller rescues a plane carrying hundreds of people from the ground, hailing him as a hero after his death.
More than 800 people have been killed and dozens of others have been reported missing since a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong aftershocks are wreaking havoc in the area, and many in the city of Palu are trapped in the rubble.
But as his coworkers ran for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agang refused to leave his seat at the heavily-fought control tower at the Mutiyara Cis Al Jufri Airport, Balu Airport.
Pattik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, remained there to ensure safe flight.
Then he thought that the tower was going to collapse, and he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Syroit, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, just before the helicopter reached the city of Palu.
"When we hear this, our hearts are broken," he said.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster relief agency says access to Tongla, Sigi and Patang is limited, with officials fearing the death toll could reach the thousands.
“While many bodies are still stuck in the rubble, we believe the death toll is likely to rise even further,” said Sutopo Parvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high rocked the city of Palu, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are arriving with aid and supplies.
Risa Kusumah, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing the bodies every minute.
Clean water is rarely available.
"They're trying to take the markets everywhere."
Jane Zelfand, head of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll see there.
It's already a mess, but it can still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Bali on Sunday and told the country's military: "I request you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation work.
Are you ready for that?" he asked.
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lombok struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says no one is missing after Saltwater Lake plane crash
The airline is operating a plane that fell into a Pacific Salt Lake in Micronesia, which said all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a news release that it had not been able to obtain a male passenger's details as of midnight on Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to locate him.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, including his age and country of origin.
After the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Sook Island Airport, the area boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six people were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the crash and what happened next.
The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Navy say the plane crashed into a salt lake.
Some people believe that the plane crashed.
U.S. traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a good thing," Jones said.
Jaynes and the others said they had to get out of the plane, which was sinking through an emergency exit.
He said the crew members were scared, screamed, and he was hit in the head.
According to the US Navy, sailors working at a nearby port also used float boats to help rescue people before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, not one of which is Air New Guinea.
An analysis of the night's bells by the woman who was fated to live
On Saturday, the prosecutor's claim came true in a retrial of a man accused of setting a Mississippi woman on fire in 2014.
US Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
He outlined to the jury how, using cell phone records, he discovered that on the night of her death, he had fragmented the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Delis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers.
The Clarion Ledger reports that on the evening of Chambers' death, Rowlett obtained location information from various cell phones that showed that Delis was with him.
Police went to Sanford to question him when reports showed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time he said he was with him.
Sanford made a decision on Saturday, testifying that he was not in town that day.
When the state attorney, Delisle, was in Sanford's truck that night and asked if he was telling the truth, Sanford said, "He's lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
It's also worth noting that Dumbledore has been missing for nearly two weeks.
The two had only known each other for a week.
Shortly after Chambers' death, Rowlett said that he had deleted all the messages, calls, and contact information of the Chambers from his phone.
"He's ruined her life," he said.
The parties will present their arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to a jury by the end of the day.
The High Priestess: What is mental hip hop?
The three-legged hip hop group wants to challenge their music with positive messages to change the negative impact on their music genre.
High Breit, from Bristol, says the group has moved away from its roots in hip hop music and political news and has gone on to face social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate the psychedelic hip-hop music.
Artists like The Fugees and Common, through artists like Akala and Loki, have seen a resurgence in the UK recently.
Another black hole?!
A New York nurse has sued a couple after receiving a "racist" text message.
A New York nurse has filed a lawsuit against the couple, accusing them of racially disparaging her after she said she was "another black woman" and had her job terminated after she received the wrong text message.
The couple denied that they were racist, saying the case was tantamount to a "bribery racket."
Linsey Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two, was a nurse on the first day of work in 2016 when she saw Giselle Maris, a black woman.
Mrs. Plasco-Flexman sent a text message to her husband, saying, "Do whatever you want, another black man."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her inattention, the "disgraceful" Plasco-Flexman told Maurice that the nurse he had been working with was an African-American, that she was not doing well, and that he had left the job and had sent her to work for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris gave them a day's pay for their work and sent them home via Uber.
Now, though laid-off Maris is suing the couple and has not signed a contract, he has already claimed compensation of $350 a day for six months as he said he would stay and work with them.
"Look here, I'm going to show them that they shouldn't do something like this," he said, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refused to call themselves racists, saying that when they could not trust Maris after catching her, it was reasonable for them to leave the job.
"My wife sent me something she didn't think she would ever tell me.
She is not racist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Flasco, told The Post.
"But even if it were wrong, would you give your child into the hands of someone who was rude?"
Is that your baby's too?
Tell me.”
Flasco said his wife was only two months pregnant and that he was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to support someone like that?
"That's not a good thing," the banker said.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has condemned the couple on social media and severely attacked their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that Bedington publishers feared that the bear would not be the same as the bear that spoke to readers
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankell, was born shortly after she accepted the book's edition, when she wrote of the letter: "It's hard to imagine anyone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's amazing to know what we know about Paddington's greatest success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being induced to write a children's book with a small bear toy, would have been anguished by the rejection of his work, in addition, the 60th anniversary of the book's release, which he said was a "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Describing Paddington as "the most important member of our family," he added that his father was proud of his gradual success.
"He was a quiet man, but he wasn't a quiet man," she said.
“But because Paddington was so loyal to him, it was to him, when your child achieved something: even if you didn’t do it, it was like it was something you were proud of.
I think he's seen success in that regard.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit for it."
My daughter was dying, and I had to give her the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Nice Hospital, where doctors struggled to save her life in vain.
"She's on the phone all the time, it's so bad, I didn't expect to be able to," said Mrs. Ednan Labrous.
Then I got a phone call from Nat, she said she was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I replied.
"I like you, Daisy," he said.
I'll get back to you soon, Dad.
I'll get back to you, Dad.
In order to keep her heart beating, the doctors gave her some medicine and left her body.
She had been dead for some time, it was just that she had stopped functioning as a member.
I knew it was going to happen, so I sat there and waited.
I couldn't cry or cry because I had family and other people around me.
We had to put everything together."
Eventually, Edna Labrous, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of what was going on around her.
"Nobody knows," she said.
"I had a headache and I was coughing all day.
It's hard to describe, but it's the kind of feeling I've been unable to put down for days when I was on the plane.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much she likes it."
In the bridge, sad women who give out information cards to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are fighting to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are providing cards on a Welsh bridge, containing promising news and helpline numbers.
Miss Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression when he was 13 and took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want anything to happen to my parents," he said.
Miss Davies, 45, who lives in Litney, said her son was a wonderful cook who would bring a smile to someone else's face.
"Everybody knows he's going to bounce back.
They will never be able to say, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>He’s got the power to do anything.’
Before he left, he said, “If you knew what you were doing, you would know it.”
In 2014, his brother, Tyler, who was 11 at the time, took his own life after seeing him.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be an outcome."
Ms. Davis made these cards to say, "Friends, just let someone know you're going to be there to talk."
Do not be silent, but speak your mind.
Ms. Humphrey, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly before her mother died.
"He didn't say anything, he didn't say anything, he was sad or depressed," she said.
"In the last couple of weeks, we've seen a change in our mindset.
On Christmas Day he was worn out - even when the children opened their presents, he did not look at them or see anything."
His death was a great loss to them, but he had to endure it too, and he said: “It has ruined the family.
It's split us in two.
But we have to fight it all."
If you are struggling to cope with the loss, you can call the Samaritans organization at 116 123 (UK and Ireland), or email jo<0x40>samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans website.
As the FBI begins the investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance
"I thought if we got what he asked for - a limited investigation in anticipation of completion within the stipulated time - we might be able to bring about some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and he feared that the group was "falling apart" amid an irreversible stalemate.
"Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's time for compassion to take over.
The by-elections are still five weeks away, and if the Republicans lose, as expected, on November 6, then they will be weakened in their attempt to get to the country's Supreme Court as long as they choose.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call Mr. Gana, who had called the senators and worked for him in the White House, to meet Mr. Bush's private secretary, his wife, Ashley.
What will happen when the FBI takes over?
The Senate will have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats on the ballot.
It is not clear whether Mr Gavana will get at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate vote, which would end the drag on Vice President Mike Pence and lead to his confirmation by the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's regime, the number of North Koreans who have left the country has fallen.
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of people leaving North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing information from South Korea's Unification Ministry, Park Pyong-seok said 1,127 people had left in the previous year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the most important factors were the tight border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the high costs demanded by traffickers.
Pyongyang has not publicly commented.
Most of those who left North Korea were eventually given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, the longest border between the two Koreas, and the DMZ, the most heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, is easier to cross than the border.
China considers North Koreans to be illegal immigrants and often forcibly deports them.
Relations between North and South Korea - where the two are still at war - have made significant progress in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on the nuclear talks that had stalled the talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed on broad terms to work in the direction of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in our country's security, and under such circumstances, there would be no way that we would put our weapons down first," Mr. Ree Avcre told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has said that Fred Cavanaugh is "crazy" and that he doesn't deserve the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who is about to nominate Fred Cavana to the Supreme Court, has called them "crazy" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his animalistic nature.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
In response to Gavana's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said, "I couldn't have said that, but I think if a woman had ever done that, she would have said she was 'crazy'."
He vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During her initial statement, Gawana was found to be very emotional, sometimes almost screaming, and having a sore throat while discussing her family and her years at her high school.
He openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grossly and cohesive assassination" organized by the angry Liberals after Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
In Pelosi's words, Gawain's witness proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because his testimony showed that he was biased in favor of the Democrats.
"With his statements, and the way he went after the Clinton family and after the Democrats, I think he has made himself ineligible," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if she would try to dismiss Gavana if she was found guilty, as well as if the Democrats had a majority in the House, she hesitated to respond.
"What I'm going to say is this -- if he's not telling the truth to the House or to the FBI, he's not just fit for the Supreme Court, he's not fit for the court he's standing in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she's concerned about Gavana's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she thinks of him as an old-time judge.
He declined to comment on whether he would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a crazy, one-sided person to go to court, and we'll say, 'That's not fair,'" Pelosi said.
All women have to fight against it.
It's a fair word war, which has been raging in anger for months and years, and he can't say it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” said Ms. Steinmeier after 45 years of being with me.
“This isn’t going to happen, is it?”
He continued, "A woman who was an officer somewhere was of great help to me, and even when she was angry, she cried, but she developed a strategy, that is, when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm furious."
He said he would go.
I think that's a wonderful idea."
To some extent, we allow tears to be a way of expressing anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One thing I remember well from my early work was sitting in an office dominated by men, where I was found crying in unspeakable anger, when an angry manager, who I had always feared, grabbed my neck and led me upstairs.
"I've never seen you cry," she said.
They don't know you're tough.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to make you like that."
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democrat Congresswoman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart for his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair with another woman outside of marriage and forced to run for election, Ms. Schroeder was so disgusted that she said there was no reason to examine any idea of running for president herself.
"It's not a good idea," he said, laughing for a moment.
"There were seven other candidates already in the race, the last one they needed, the other one.
One of them said, “It’s like a snowflake, and there are seven dwarfs.”
Because it was the final stage of the campaign, he was behind fundraising, and he swore that if he couldn't raise $2 million, he wouldn't enter the competition.
It was a losing battle.
It was only then that he realized that some of his supporters would give him $1,000 for men, and he would only give him $250.
And they marveled, "Do they think that I am going to be reprieved?"
When he began his speech by saying that he would not launch a formal campaign, he became increasingly embittered - thanks to the people who supported him, the organization that made it more difficult to raise money, to target voters rather than representatives - and to anger over sexism.
When asked about how the press treated him, Ms. Schroeder said, "You might think I had a nervous breakdown."
"You may have guessed that I'm a business tycoon.
I wonder what they're going to put on my wall?
“Is she crying?”
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing
While the initial counter-attacks of the trade war between the United States and China were tearing apart and the war seemed unlikely to end, experts say the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
A new significant fight broke out this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of items that would tax half of all goods coming from China into the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in a similar way, most recently imposing five to ten percent tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods.
China is committed to giving the United States a foot-step, along with the world's second-largest economy, a no-win situation at any point in time.
To push back on Washington means to comply with the demands, but to openly whip up the US would be a very uncomfortable situation for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, if Beijing makes good use of its military card, the US trade war crisis will only benefit China in the long run by reducing their dependence on each other.
"The reality is that the sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing is likely to trigger an economic reversal in either of the two countries, which the observers have agreed upon before," said Abigail Grace, a sub-researcher with a focus on Asia in The Center for New American Security, a thinker.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says He's 'ready' to Return Refugees to the Country
The Syrian government says it is ready to help refugees return to their homes and is calling for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by a seven-year-long war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawlam said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation is more balanced and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In order to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rehabilitating the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
There are all conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country, and they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that directly targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mawlam said the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the war-torn country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that support terrorism.
The European Ryder Cup was held in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team in a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Lee Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
Since 1993, the U.S. team has faced six consecutive defeats on European soil and has never won the Ryder Cup.
Denmark captain Thomas Jorns scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, and the European team took the crown back.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was floundering all over Tornament, drowned his tee-shot at the bar-3, 16th hole, and hid his match for Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shines in all of his circuits and has become the 1st person out of 4 players to go 5-0-0, ever since this tournament's current system was launched in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest-ranked athlete in the European team, was defeated by Darfjörn Olesen of Denmark 5&4.
The world's first-order athlete, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Bolder, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup match.
Former striker Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who played in eight Ryder Cups, became the European champion in all of Tornament's tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't resist.
It has been a difficult year.
I want to thank God for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It was about the team, and I’m happy that I was able to do that,” said Garcia, who is passionate about European success.
He was replaced by his native compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles match on Sunday by 2&1.
“Defeating Tiger Woods is something I’m incredibly proud of and I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods, who lost all four of his games in France, now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The odd statistic kept by one of the greatest athletes of all time is that from just next to Jack Nicklaus, he has won 14 major titles.
The U.S. team, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Faina, stumbled across Fairways on all weekends, playing high-end golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Farig, speaking after his team's agonizing performance, said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought as hard as they could."
This morning, it was time for a bit of a warm-up in Europe.
We lost it.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of them played very well.
We will get back together and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward," he said.
I love these guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to beat them.
They played better than us."
New information on redfish: There has been a decrease in digestion in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that reddish - coloured digestive tracts have generally decreased in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County have been reported to have exceptionally blooming conditions - which only indicate a decrease in the digestive tract.
The flowering of redapple extends along the coast, from northern Pinellas, to southern Lee County, for a distance of nearly 130 miles.
The patches can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but only in a few places compared to last week.
Red flags were also seen in the area.
It was reported last week that there were moderate sediments in Pinellas County or beyond the coastal area, with at least the highest concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, the lowest to the highest levels in County County Manhattan, the lowest to the highest levels in County County, the lowest to the highest levels in County Sarasota County, the highest to the highest levels in County, and the highest to the lowest levels in County Charlotte County.
Respiratory strains continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier County.
There has been no reported case of a respiratory tract infection in northwest Florida in the past week.
