There have been revolutions before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not just praise that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and Indian politics.
Today, we can see that there is a perception among the people that revolutionaries were mere fools and did not care about human lives.
The period of Bhagat Singh gives us a sense of their humanity, clarity of thought and ability.
After the April 1929 bombing of the Constituent Assembly, Bhagat Singh's name became popular in India.
In Tamil Nadu, it was introduced to the public in 1930.
But within a year of its launch, its popularity had spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in the history of the country, including that of Mahatma Gandhi, no leader born in the North has ever spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
That's because they're paparazzi.
The week after Bhagat Singh's death, an editorial was published in the Republic Weekly titled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial appreciated many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and made some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some of the sections from the table are:
"In fact, if Bhagat Singh was convinced that all his policies were right and that the way he acted was the right way and if he decided to carry it out, we would certainly say that he should have acted as he did, and if he had not done so, we would not have said that he was a reasonable man."
We call him a real man.
It is our strong conviction that India really needs a policy of Bhagat Singh.
Had Bhagat Singh not been hanged and brought back to life, there would have been no basis for this success.
If we hadn't done that, we would still have had Benghazi and the death penalty.
Why did Bhagat Singh have to suffer and die of illness on his own, rather than his mother's life to show the world the path to true equality and peace for the people of India?
No one else has the right to say it, but we have the right to say it, and we have the right to say it.”
This is what the Father has revealed in the parable of the sower.

Therefore, there is no reason for the government to be indifferent to the plight of the Kashmiri people.
Let me ask you, how many people have died in the last eight years of the Clinton administration?

DMK President M.K. Stalin visited the site of the excavations at Keeladi, showcasing the Tamil culture of Vaigaikarai.

The city's civilization began in the 6th century BC on the banks of the Ganges River to the north.
But in the south, on the banks of the Vaigai River, Tamils lived a high-class urban life in the 6th century BC.
The results of the excavations are an attempt to rewrite the history of the Indian subcontinent.

Speaking to the media, Tamil Nadu Minister for Official Language and Tamil Culture K Pandiarajan said:
Phase 5 of the excavations at Keeladi marks a turning point in the historical study of the Sangam period in Tamil Nadu.
Keeladi was a prosperous area from 6th century BC to 1st century AD.
The study of urbanization on the banks of the Vaigai river is based on the evidence available at present.
Scientific chronology of the excavations at Keeladi has concluded that the Tamil-Brahmi period is more than 100 years old and Tamil Nadu was the first literate society in the 6th century BC.
Samples from 70 skeletons have been sent to the post-graduate and research institute Deccan College for scientific analysis.
The species was classified by species in the analysis and identified by species such as the whale, buffalo, goat, wild boar, arthropod and peacock.
Cattle, buffalo and goats are used for agriculture and some of the animals such as cheetahs, cheetahs and wild boars are also used for food.
With the conclusion of this analysis, the Sangam society, whose main occupation was agriculture, also took up animal husbandry.
The samples of bricks, lime-based roof tiles and clay-textile coatings have been sent to the University of Vellore for analysis.
In each of these, minerals such as silica, limestone, iron, aluminium and magnesium are available in the study.
In order to conserve such rare species, a museum is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.20 crore at a prime location for the benefit of a large number of Tamil scholars, students and the general public.
Phase 5 of the project will continue for two weeks.

Is BJP doing politics in Tamil Nadu?
In any case, it is said that the BJP will eventually take over caste politics in Tamil Nadu if Suthi and Thamara can't be planted anywhere else.
When Modi became the Prime Minister for the first time, he was in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time, i.e., during the Lok Sabha elections, Amit Shah said, "You don't know what to do, you have to bloom lotus in Tamil Nadu."
However, only five of the five seats were up for grabs.
The BJP is in power across the country but there is a wave of protests in Tamil Nadu.
It is above all a matter of Triple Talaq, Kashmir, imposition of Hindi, one nation one language.
When everything is put together, it becomes more transparent.
That is why the BJP leadership is so tight-lipped on the leaders of Tamil Nadu, which is why the state leadership is yet to be appointed.
The BJP, on the other hand, is planning to sweep the state in the next Assembly elections.
It seems that the BJP has come to a conclusion almost through direct field report, intelligence report and so on.
Whether it is the AIADMK or the DMK or the DMK, there is a feeling among the community that the two Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the Nadars, the Vanniyars and the Devendrakula Vellalars.
This is said to be a cause of concern for the Dravidian parties.
The BJP has already started implementing this strategy.
It was a way to honor, honor, or honor the memory of that person.
Tamilisai Soundararajan was appointed as the Governor of Telangana.
Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be giving importance to Nadars, who hold high positions in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP behaves in such a manner, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.
There's no question that this is going to be a boon for Bush in politics.
At the same time, it is not clear whether these activities of the BJP will become more fuel for the burning fire as Tamil Nadu is already reeling under caste politics.
If it were true that the caste had started to burn, even the lotus that is now blooming in Tamil Nadu would have been burnt in the same fire!
