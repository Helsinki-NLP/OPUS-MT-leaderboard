Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about "sitting like a fool"
There is a lot of anger among some lawmakers over the proposal to change their designation to "MWPs" (member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal arose because there was a plan to rename the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament from across the political spectrum are concerned that this move will invite ridicule.
An assembly member from the Labour Party said his party was concerned that "the name bears a pronounced resemblance to the TWP and the PWP."
To the readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "TWP" means dull, and "PWP" means dull.
A Plaid PM also said that she suggested other names as she was "not happy" with her group as a whole.
He noted that his group had an "open mind" regarding the name change, but suggested that the word "muppet" from MWP was a brief phrasal jump.
In this case, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a draft of the bill to change its name, said: "The final decision regarding the descriptive wording of what shall be called the members of the Assembly shall certainly be discussed among the members."
The Government of Wales Act, 2017 empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public opinion and received widespread public support for what it called the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the status of Assembly members, the Commission favoured the designation of Members of Parliament or WMPs, but in the Public Opinion Survey, the WMP received the most support.
It is clear that the assembly members are suggesting other names, but the fight to reach a consensus will be a headache for presiding officer Elin John, who is expected to submit a draft law on the change within weeks.
The law relating to modifications would also include other changes relating to the manner in which the Assembly functions, including the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
When the law is discussed, the members of the assembly get a final vote on the question of what they will call themselves.
Macedonia to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote is set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province known as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to a piece of its territory, and Athens has consistently rejected its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Jorge Ivanov, a opponent of the Plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Sayeev, argue that the name change is only the price they would have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Mary's Church is in a state of mourning
"Historically, the older people I've talked to have said that there was a bar and a mosque in every nook and corner," Mr Adams said.
“There’s no two today.”
He said he understands the need for closures.
"Nowadays, people interact in different ways," he said.
"People no longer have living rooms in bars to go to on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leadership expects, "more soon they will be back where they started."
He added that apartments with rented rooms full of people could be built in lieu of churches, which would not help the remaining wildlife sanctuaries in the area.
"Most of the people who buy rentals in such buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will accelerate to the day when all the churches will be closed together, because most people who move into these rentals are unlikely to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the churches of white people, with Harlem becoming a black community, and Harlem becoming a metropolitan community in 1870, ten years after St. Martin.
The first white Methodist church moved here in the 1930s.
The church of black people who worshipped nearby, named the building after themselves.
St. Martin's Church was captured by the church of blacks under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of small merchants on 125th Street, and Rev. John, because the street, the principal place for shopping in Harlem, opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused much damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to renovate the building, and they commissioned Carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called Carillon "the church bell of the poor."
The expert who read Carillon in July described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an irreplaceable historical tool."
According to Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, this was the first carillon ever played by a black musician in the world. Dionysio A Lind was a black musician who moved to a much larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merry Weather, St. Martin's Church could not find another replacement for him.
The complex story of architects and contractors has been heard in St. Martin for the past few months, some of whom have been brought up by the church's alma mater, some by the episcopal figure.
In July, Westry, the governing body of the parish, which includes Alma leaders, wrote to the diocese expressing their concerns that while the diocese had nothing to do with hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese, the diocese should be "paid."
Some residents have complained about a lack of transparency in the system.
A 13-year-old boy who was driving a lobster in California was injured by a shark.
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday, the opening day of the season.
The attack took place near Beacons Beach in Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Sunday morning, while he was diving in the sea with friends for about half an hour, he heard a boy screaming for help and his friends approached him and pulled him out of the water.
At first, I thought it was the sound of a baby crying, but I got a bite!
He said he later found out that I had a crush on him.
"His whole thigh was torn open," Hammel said when he got the baby.
“I called everyone to come out of the water and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>There was a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The child was airlifted to San Diego Radi Children's Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told reporters that he saw a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but the shark was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that there were injuries from the trauma on the upper part of the child's body.
For investigation - security purposes, access to Swami at Nesinitas from Ponto Beach, Casablade has been closed for 48 hours by the authorities.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but they are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s to capture the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is preparing to take on the brands Boots, Super Drug and Debenhams by opening department store-style beauty shops that employ specialist assistants.
As part of its focus on the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, Sainsbury's plans to open 'Beautiful Isles' in 11 stores across the country, and if this becomes a success, it will open more stores next year, with the cosmetics market in the UK still in a downtrend, despite sales of fashion goods and home appliances.
The investment in the beauty sector is part of an effort by supermarkets to take advantage of shelf space used for TVs and microwaves.
Sainsbury said it will double the number of cosmetics products to 3,000, and these products will also include the brands Revlon, SC, Tweezerman and Dr. Paupeau for the first time.
The current product ranges like Loreal, Mabiline and Butts Bees will also have more space with similar branded spaces, as seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is once again introducing boutique makeup range, and most of the products are vegan-friendly, and such products are increasingly demanded by young shoppers.
In addition to this, Fragrance, a perfume retailer, will be allowed to try out shop discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will start operating at Celli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small quantities of daily food from local convenience stores are now seen, which means that there is a lot to be done to entice people to visit supermarkets.
As supermarket chains struggle against discounter firms such as Aldi and Lidl that sell more services and non-food products, outlets will be more like department stores, said Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsburys.
Sainsbury's is opening argross outlets in hundreds of stores, and many stores have introduced Habitats outlets, which Sainsbury's acquired two years ago, which the company says has increased grocery sales and made the acquisition of the chains more profitable.
The earlier attempt by the supermarket to revive the Beauty Department and Pharmacy Department had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's experimented with a combined venture with Boots, but the collaboration ended with disputes over the distribution of revenue from chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 of Sainsbury's pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Adding a unique range of expensive skin care brands, including La Roche-Pose and Vichy, across four stores, the company said Lloyds will also play a role in the project.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have drastically changed the look of our beauty islands to improve the environment that customers get.
We have also invested heavily in hiring specially trained assistants who provide advice and suggestions.
Our range of brands is designed for all purposes, with an attractive environment and convenient locations which means that we have now become a cosmetic destination that challenges the old way of shopping and customers can’t escape.”
Peter Jones 'indignant' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holye Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 deal with Dragon's Den with Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on contracts with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to spend on a home - accessories brand, Truely.
People were comparing the business of these pairs with Gaineth Paltrow's goup brand.
The next morning, the 30-year-old announced on Instagram that he was retiring from the show.
Willoughby's last-minute exit from the lucrative lifestyle brand business has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones - with Willoughby pulling out of the deal to focus on his new big deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
In a turbulent meeting at Marlowe's headquarters in Buckinghamshire, Jones's business was revealed by his close friends to have agreed to a golden shower on TV, as he had received new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The world has compared their business to Gaineth Paltrow's Goop, a brand that would double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune if he continued in the business.
With Willoughby announcing on Instagram that he was leaving Trully, Jones took a flight out of the UK to visit one of his holiday homes.
A news source says: “True has been one of Holly’s priorities for a long time.
It was a long-term project that could help Holly financially for the next one or two decades.
Holly's decision to quit shocked everyone involved with the venture.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because the launch of this venture was supposed to take place soon.
At Marlowe Headquarters, there is a godown full of goods to sell."
With large investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to textiles and homewares, experts believe the withdrawal of Morning Presenter, one of Britain's most financially capable players, could be a huge liability for the company and delay the launch.
This is the end of a long friendship between the two.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for over ten years.
Willoughby began working with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's production company.
Willoby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S, and will now be seen as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity, instead of Ann and McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business affairs."
After a long time, we fell in love."
He has been criticized by the media for his "non-responsiveness" toward the North Korean leader.
"Why did the president give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the "news anchor."
"I didn't leave anything."
Trump said he was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June, which he hailed as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
Nuclear disarmament talks are still ongoing.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "relevant response" from the US to its initial denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a more optimistic view.
"We have a very good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, such as the suspension of rocket experiments, helping to free hostages, and the repatriation of American servicemen's remains to their homeland.
He had a unique way of talking about his relationship with Jesus.
"It's easy to talk the way the president should talk, but instead of 10,000 people trying to cross outside of this limited space, we'll have about 200 people standing here right now," Trump said.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than ten percent of the Lombok population has lost their home, it has not been declared a national disaster, a pre-requisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not want to request international help, which is a bit of a challenge," Ms Sambang said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear if foreign officials will be able to work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to relief efforts.
Considering the earthquake that Indonesia has to experience on a regular basis, the country still remains unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Asiha, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
Although the warning is in effect, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even with the best of weather, traveling to many of the islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters have made the transportation of goods more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, has now left for Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
During the election campaign, President Joko Widodo promised to improve Indonesia's infrastructure, but he spent money on roads and railways.
As Mr. Joko is set to face re-election next year, the lack of money has made his rule miserable.
Mr Joko also faces pressure from the sectarian problems that have been lurking in Indonesia, with the country's Muslim majority preferring to follow a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes after Christian gangs and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets with knives, bows, arrows and other deadly weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring the goal in the 89th minute in a match at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Zardan received a pass from Shakiri when he was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal post, during which Liverpool were trailing 1-0.
Sturridge hit the ball to his left side before hitting the ball facing the post.
This effort flew the ball over the box and the ball slipped facing the right upper part of the net.
The ball fell to the body of the jumper Kepa Arisabalaga and finally shook his right arm.
"I've been trying to be in that position to get the ball, and always have a player like Shaq pushing the ball forward as much as possible, so I've tried to make it as time-consuming as possible," Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw the cannon coming, I touched the ball, I didn't think too much, I took the shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time with a goal from Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In that game, the Blues striker gave Matteo a pass before turning around in the middle of the field and rushing into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic took a quick 'Give-and-Go' pass in the middle of the field.
He then led Hazard to the box and gave Kovacic a beautiful throw ball.
Hazard hit the ball with his left foot and struck Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.

The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the tsunami in the country had risen to 832.
Several people are reported to be trapped beneath the rubble of buildings that collapsed following the 7.5-magnitude quake, with waves rising as high as 20 feet, Sutupo Parwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is scattered among the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested 30 people on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in a brickhead in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Muse, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are appealing to anyone who has seen or heard anything unusual in the area to come forward with evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its initial stages, but I request those living in and around John Street, Brickenhead, to come forward to give evidence to anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, as there may be some footage on the dashcam footage of the drivers, as such information may be critical to our investigation.'
A police spokesman said the owner of the body was a resident of Buckingham and their bodies were found inside a property.
Friends who believe they know the deceased woman arrived at the crime scene this afternoon to ask questions about where the body was found.
Police said they are investigating the matter and are in the process of identifying the victim's family members.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muse, tried to climb into his flat but was stopped by people entering or leaving the building, police said.
The taxi driver was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will take hours to get back in and out of the building.
I've heard people say that the whole area is a crime scene.
I saw a woman crying at the crime scene.
She said: "It was terrible.
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
A group of police officers watched from inside the building.
Anyone in possession of the information is asked to mail directly to the <0x40>MerPolCC address, call 101, or call Crimestoppers without informing them by calling "247 30 September" or by calling "0800 555 111."
Cromwell's statue in Parliament was the site of the most recent monument demolition, sparking a "history twist" controversy.
The removal of Cromwell's statue should be called poetic justice, because England's cultural relics and religious artifacts were destroyed by his fanatic Puritan followers in a manner similar to what the Taliban had done.
Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "idiot" and "an attempt to distort history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current debate over the removal of the statues necessitated the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster.
The events of the idolatry during the English Civil War were never at Crowell's command, and Cromwell never did.
Cromwell is now being sacrificed for the events of his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell, in the previous century.
The wonderfully built Cromwell statue is proof of the 19th-century opinion on Cromwell and is part of the history of a leader many think is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "While carrying on his monologue reign, he was the one who protected the palace from pressure from external forces, more so now than at the end of the 19th century, when many, perhaps many, considered Cromwell.
Whether it is a complete and accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is undeniable that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation over time and Cromwell was an acknowledged individual leader who represented one of the two factions that fought to divide.
His achievements as a 'Lord Protector' should also be celebrated and remembered.
A Chinese farmer was killed.
A farmer has been killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man known as 'Yuan' was found near a piglet market in Lupanshuu, Guizhou province, where blood vessels were ruptured and covered in blood.
A pig farmer in China's Qinghai province, on 30 May 20015, prepares vaccinations for pigs in a pig farm.
According to reports, the man arrived with a relative from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he was found dead in a nearby field.
He said there was a large amount of blood coming out of his mouth.
According to the forensic report, the pig, weighing 550 pounds, hit the farmer and killed him.
The so-called "Woo" was "full of blood in my cousin's legs, broken in pieces," according to the Guangdong Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market to feed the pigs at 4.40 am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The dog did not attack the victim or his family.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop him from attacking anyone, while the police collected evidence from the scene of the murder.
According to reports, the man's family and market authorities are negotiating for compensation for his death.
Although rare, incidents of attacks on humans by pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was hit by a 650-pound pig tractor, and his wife saved him by scaring the pig.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was killed and eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba-cursion that told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood might act as a "stimulus."
"They are playing.
They're stingy, very inquisitive... and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect," the farmer said.
Heavy rain is expected in the southwestern U.S. as part of the end of Hurricane Rosa.
According to the weather forecast, the storm is weakening as it moves upwards into colder seas off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the rose will bring heavy rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday morning, Rosa was expected to hit a speed of 85 meters per hour, a Category 1 hurricane that stood at 385 southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move south on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a cloudburst has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east and reach the west coast of the U.S. As a tropical storm approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture into the north and southwest of the U.S.
It's expected to rain 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity and approaching cloud cover will act, causing heavy rainfall across the southwest over the next few days.
Rainfall between 1 and 4 inches can cause sudden flooding and landslides locally, and landslides in the desert.
In some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, heavy tropical humidity can cause rain that reaches 2 to 3 inches per hour.
Rainfall between 2 and 4 inches is expected in the southwestern parts, especially over Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, there is a possibility of sudden flooding as the conditions will deteriorate rapidly.
It is strongly advised not to travel to the desert where there is a threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains, which make the canyons a slippery slope, and thunder and lightning, can cause local turbulent winds and dust storms.
The approaching cloudburst will bring heavy rain to parts of southern California's coast.
A total rainfall of more than half an inch is expected and may cause minor landslides and slippery roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region this year.
Tropical rain showers are expected to reach Arizona on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and will become widespread on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rains are expected to continue in all four directions on Tuesday and continue into Wednesday.
Warmer temperature changes will be felt throughout the US in October as the Arctic Ocean cools but the tropical wave continues to be really hot.
This can sometimes lead to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A perfect example of dramatic temperature fluctuations across the central U.S. can be expected on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha and Nebraska, and between St. Louis, Des Moines and Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will begin to increase and develop again.
October is expected to start with a heat wave over most of central and eastern U.S., with a spread of 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which could be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of temperatures above average in the western U.S. until the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by more than 20 million viewers.
The testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexually abusing her in 1980 on six television networks, was seen by more than 20 million people.
While regular programs were interrupted by broadcasters for a last-minute turnaround on Friday, political parties continue to distance themselves from the issue; the turnaround was part of an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had assaulted him at a high school party and tried to dress him up.
"""I am 100 per cent sure that nothing of that sort has happened,"" he said."
On Friday, more than 20.4 million people are likely to watch it, Nielsen reports.
The average viewership was recorded on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership data from the Met networks that broadcast the news, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, is yet to be available.
In addition, Nielsen has technical difficulties in taking in the number of people sitting in the offices and watching TV programs.
To explain it, it has a sizeable audience for people who watch a football match or an Academy Award.
Commentators on the Fox News channel, who strongly supported Cavanaugh’s appointment, said Nielsen led an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the full-day trial.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
NBC received 3.1 million viewers, followed by NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million.
Public interest in the matter continued to grow after the trial.
Flake was the main star of Friday's dramatic events.
The moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying that it would vote in favour of Kavanau, and on Friday morning, protesters shouted slogans against him as he tried to board the elevator for a trial by a judiciary committee, which had captured cameras of CNN and CBS channel.
When people were angry with him, he looked down for several minutes and was live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," one woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"You have the power when so many women are powerless," someone told him.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he had more to say at the committee's meeting, before closing the elevator's door.
Later, at the time when the Committee was voting to decide whether the nomination of Kavanagh to the entire Senate should go forward for a vote, all cable networks and broadcast networks broadcast it live.
Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake was partially convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
The decision was taken after talks with Crohn's and several other senators.
Flake's decision had power because it was clear that the Republican Party did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister says he is "playing politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that critics of her plan to leave the European Union were "playing politics" with the future of Britain and that the national interest was being undermined.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2019.
On the front page of May's interview, she also published an interview with Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, who, in an interview, called the UK and the European Union's "totally ridiculous" proposal to retaliate against each other's tariffs, fuelled the attack on her "checkers plan for Brexit."
Dayton Simpson, suspect in shooting death of LSU star, has been arrested in connection with the shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing 20-year-old Wade Sims, a former LSU basketball player.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released video footage of the clash between Simpson and Simpson, but police said the glasses were lost during the fight.
The police recovered spectacles from the scene of the murder and found Simpson's DNA samples in them, according to CBS brother WAFB.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed that he had fatally shot Wade.
Prosecutors say he has a bond of $350,000.
A preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office said the cause of death was a bullet wound from the head to the neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for helping to carry out the investigation that has moved the arrest.
LSU's chief executive, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for their "serious vigilance and effort for justice."
Simmons was 20 years old.
This six-year-old forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
Upon learning of Wade's death, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in a great shock" on Friday morning.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanic ash spits up in Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocat<0xC3><0xA9>petl volcano reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
After the volcano's face was activated and gas and ash were left out for more than 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexico residents to stay away from the volcano.
The building was being watched by several bells and whistles.
Just like Xochimilco, images of people showing ash-trays on the windows of cars in the city's vicinity have been circulating on social media.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed an increase in activity on the volcano, located about 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake that rocked central Mexico at 7.1 magnitude.
The volcano, which has been active since 1994, is known as "Don Goo."
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the country's independence election.
Riots broke out between pro-independence protesters and police in Barcelona, with six people arrested, and thousands taking part in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's referendum on independence.
The police took action after a masked mob, which supported separatism, threw eggs at the police and threw a dustbin, creating black clouds of dust on the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
Police resorted to lathicharge to control the protests.
When pro-independence groups chanted for several hours "not to be forgotten, not to be pardoned," the anti-union protesters shouted "let Spain live forever."
Local media reported that 15 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but more than a year after the Catalans celebrated the referendum supporting the partition, tensions continue to rise in free-spirited areas.
Although a majority of voters supported independence, the number of those who voted was small, as a majority of those who opposed partition abstained from voting.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were infected with nuts last year when police tried to close polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups had camped throughout Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
Despite the protests, the protesters were forced to find a way out.
Sixty-eight-year-old Narcissus Termes, who was attending a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for the future of Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are in a state of shock," he said.
In local elections held last December, although small but important victories were achieved, the parties supporting Catalan independence have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, either because some of the best leaders have fled the country or because some leaders have been put under house arrest while awaiting trial for their role in organising the Referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Forty-two-year-old John Peugeot, a mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone, said the leaders of both parties were stoking the fire.
"Things are getting worse," he said.
Auriol Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since late last year before a trial, announced on Saturday that she will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the deterioration of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government," he said.
London derry: People arrested for crashing car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballinagarh Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Blemings said both the gates and the building were damaged.
The car's crossbow is likely to have been fired.
Meng's goal against the Rangers was 1-0.
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston led to victory.
As manager of the Ibrox club, Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 matches.
Holt's team was promoted to second place and Dolly Meng's goal became a different goal.
Gerrard's team continues to be without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday, they must face the top team, Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them.
On Thursday, they will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, the division's unbeaten run has expanded to six games, and Holt, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller last month, has yet to lose.
Livestock wasted the best opportunities provided by the visiting team.
Holt's team had to be far ahead before scoring the goal, as their direct moves presented the Rangers with all sorts of problems.
The goal was scored by Allan Lithgow and the goal was scored by Craig Hallkett, who returned the ball with a header.
"Knowing that we were able to confuse the visitors by our performance in the middle of the ground, hosts Livingstone were content to allow the Rangers to play in front of them.
That's how this important project was born.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and then Livingstone tried an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson bringing the ball to Menga, who, in turn, scored the ball from the centre of the box.
The Rangers held the ball most of the time at that point, but the hosts' defense was unbreakable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly kept the net intact.
Although the ball played by Alfredo Moreles was intercepted by Kelly, the practice continued until the second half.
Scott Pittman also tried to score, but the Rangers' goal was not conceded, and Lithgow bowled the ball out of the open field in Livingston style.
Crosses continued to come to Livingston's box, but all in vain, and the two penalty claims that Glenn Middleton was shown as a tackle foul and accused as a handball were rejected.
The term "expertise" comes from Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macron Arena
An epic performance and the result of Livingstone.
By continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory, they have excelled.
After returning to the top spot, the style of play or the team was rarely changed, but Holt's ability to hold the team together after he took the position should be appreciated.
The club had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was able to put up a well-prepared defence in order to keep Conor Goldson and Joe Voral active throughout the game.
The Rangers had a lack of motivation to compete.
"When they were under Gerard, they played superbly, and they've fallen far from that standard.
They didn't have the finishing ability and only once did they reach the goal face of the host team, which was a warning to the Rangers as they were now at the bottom of the points table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's visit to Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, the smiles and blue skies were palpable.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - a visit aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They also discussed human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
It has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police laid out security reasons to prevent a crowd of about 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters of Erdogan had gathered outside to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters - many of them Kurdish - raised their voices and condemned Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to Germany.
The protests and cheers were a reflection of the division of some German Turks to see the visitor as a hero and others to abuse him as a dictator.
Cyclist killed in road accident in UP
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 BST, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deepford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics examined it, but the passenger died on the spot.
The accident came less than a month after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the deceased and inform his relatives.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and motorists have been asked to avoid the site of the accident.
Six officers injured in clashes inside Long-Latin prison
Six prison officials were injured in an attack on a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and the riot is still ongoing.
To bring the situation under control, specialist Tornado officers have been brought in, and the encounter, involving eight prisoners, is taking place inside a wing.
A small number of injured soldiers were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "HMP has deployed a specially trained prison staff to deal with developments in Long Latrine.
Six members of the staff were treated for the injury.
"We will never condone violence in our prisons, and we will certainly hand over those responsible for the violence to the police, who will probably spend more time in jail," he said.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, there were reports that the jail's governor had been given treatment after an inmate was attacked.
In October last year, the prison staff was attacked with pool balls by inmates, and officers trained to control violence were deployed to handle serious confrontations.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City by raising the risk of sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for cloudy areas)
A tropical depression of this magnitude is rare over Arizona, but as early as next week, when the residual power of Hurricane Rosa moves into the southwestern desert, it is likely to cause sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to cross Phoenix on a direct route and arrive on Monday evening along with the rain.
"Since 1950, storms or low pressures have brought only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix."
Katrina (1967) was a cyclonic storm within 40 miles of the AZ border," the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, and Arizona's Mogollon Rim may have up to 5 inches of isolated rain.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, can only receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, but there can be up to a total of 1 to 2 inches of isolated rain.
In the case of areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain that Rosa brings may be a blessing, as the area is facing severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, as drought is currently experienced in the South West, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial.
According to the U.S. Dot Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least severe, second-highest category of extreme drought.
The first hurricane to make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, who has not given up on the storm's power, is expected to make landfall on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm's response to the cold waters of the Pacific will reduce wind power.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of tropical winds.
Heavy rains across parts of Mexico are likely to cause flooding, putting them at risk of sudden flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and in some places as much as 10 inches is possible," Weather.com reports.
Then, as a tropical depression, it will move north across Mexico into a tropical storm before reaching its border with Arizona early Tuesday morning, then across Arizona, then into Thetan Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or its residual strength is extremely heavy rainfall over Baja California and the northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert South West," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
The rain is expected to cause sudden floods, landslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Mid-Season Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
At around 04:00 BST on Saturday, a teenager was found injured on the Excelsior terrace in the mid-afternoon area of Norton.
The child has been admitted to the hospital and his condition is stable.
Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man had been arrested in the Radstock area of Evonne.
The police have been asked to hand over the mobile phone footage of the incident to anyone who has it.
Trump said Cavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's 'little bit of anger and hatred'.
"""One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to protest against the Democratic Party's ruthless and unfair tactics,"" Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia."
"Trump said Cavanaugh had to endure the Democratic Party's ""little bits and pieces"" throughout the nomination process."
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, emotionally denying Christine Blaze Ford's allegations that she sexually harassed him when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the trial that his allegations were true.
On Saturday, the president remarked that the American people had seen the “grace, virtue and courage” of Kaunas on that day.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote given by a judge with a history of the 10th shift of public service and the most skilled legal scholar of our time," he said while speaking to supporters in West Virginia.
While talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's nomination.
"It's just one of the most important decisions of our lives.
"I'm not really competing," he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to “oppose and prevent.”
With regard to Cavanaugh’s nomination, an aide to a senior GOP leader told CNN that the first important procedural vote on the Senate floor will take place on or before Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people were killed when waves swept through the coast of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi following a massive earthquake and tsunami.
On Friday evening, when hundreds of people gathered for the festival in the city of Palu, waves rose six metres (18 feet) to land, destroying everything in front of them, and hundreds of people died in the floods.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Even when the tsunami threat was high yesterday, there were people on the beach, and people who did not flee immediately because of the warning were the victims," Sutupo Parvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, told Jakarta.
"Not only did the tsunami come, it flooded cars, logs, homes, and everything on the land," said Ngueroho, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before crashing into the coast.
He further stated that some people climbed on the trees to get relief from the tsunami and they escaped.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
An aerial view released by the disaster management agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and a mosque covered with water.
On Saturday, large waves following the end of the tsunami continued to pound the beaches.
2.4 An area inhabited by people experienced a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than a home nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said the city's geography, located on a long and narrow coastline, may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was "extensive" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were recovered from the bottom of the collapsed buildings, while 540 were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nungroho said there could be more deaths and damage in Dongla, a coastal area about 300 km north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugraho also said that the communication systems were "interrupted without any information" from Dongla.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but there's a way to be even worse," Red Cross said.
The agency was widely blamed on Saturday for not issuing a warning that there would be a tsunami in Palu, but officials explained that the waves were picking up within the time the warning was issued.
An amateur photo of a man who is giving out a tsunami warning to people walking down the street from the top floor of a building is going viral on social media.
Within a few minutes, the water had washed away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to confirm whether the footage is original.
Due to the earthquake and tsunami, the power supply was disrupted and the authorities had difficulty coordinating rescue operations as communication systems were disrupted across Palu.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the survivors lacked food and other basic amenities.
The city's airport is open only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia is more than 800.
Situations are bad.
The staff members of World Vision escaped the tsunami and arrived in the city of Palu, living in tents made of tarpaulin in the courtyard of their own office, but they passed through the sights of destruction.
"I've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Situations are very bad.
While relief teams have started to ramp up relief operations, some have complained that well-trained foreign volunteers have been prevented from travelling to Palau.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid, supplies and volunteers can only benefit from a natural disaster if the government declares it a national disaster.
It has not yet been declared a national disaster.
"This is still just a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can make arrangements for international aid, but that's not the case yet."
It is now the second night in Palu after Friday's tsunami, and friends and relatives are hoping that those who have lost their loved ones will come back through hopeful stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman from the rubble of the building, who was lying next to her mother's body.
For the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month, two of the paragliders coached by Gendon Subandano, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, were missing in the tsunami.
Including Mr. Mandagi, the others who were trapped in the Rowa Rowa Hotel were also his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional stress," he said.
Mr Gendon recalls that within hours of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, the news had spread among the paragliding community and he had sent out WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who had participated in the beach festival.
The messages were all received with only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blue check marks.
"I don't think that's the message," he said.
$26,750 stolen while filling an ATM in Newport, Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday in Newport, Lewey, Brink's officer robbed $26,750 while filling an ATM.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release that the driver of the car was trying to fill an ATM in the complex for entertainment.
While he was working, another person "ran away from the back of the Brink employee", stole the bag of money which he had brought for delivery.
According to the press release, eyewitnesses saw multiple suspects running away from the scene of the crime, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about a crime should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper pronounces his name as “Y”
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to "YES."
In a tweet on Saturday, he wrote: "The man who is officially known as Kanye West."
For a while, West's nickname was "Yes," which he used as the name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The renaming comes ahead of a live broadcast on Saturday night and he is expected to release his new album 'Yandi' during the event.
The show's creator said West was coming in place of Ariana Grande, who was pulled out of the show for "emotional reasons."
West had previously said that the new name was an abbreviation of the current professional name and that the word had religious significance to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and 'yes' means 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, you are me, we are all of us.
I've gone from "you" to "you," which means "one" - no matter what we're good or bad or confused, this is our reflection.
It's a reflection of who we are."
West is one of the most famous rappers.
Sean Combs, known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P Daddy, or Daddy, said he was in love this year and called him Brother Love.
Jay-Z, a rapper who previously worked with West, has changed his name to "Jay-S," which means he can say his name without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's president-elect says he won't use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andreas Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country enters the 50th anniversary of its bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador said at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration at Plaza, killing about 300 people. This marked the beginning of a wave of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the younger generation in Mexico by allocating a monthly subsidy to students studying and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of education and employment opportunities is the reason for the rise in youth unemployment.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
Cai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner, has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple to double U.S. spending on research in the region as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Lee made the remarks following announcements by various departments of the U.S. government about AI, even if the U.S. does not have an overall official AI policy.
Last year, China unveiled a plan to top the list of innovation by 2030.
"Given the fact that all other countries are far behind the U.S., doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we're also planting an eye on what's next in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding means that the next big AI gain is likely to be in the US.
Authored by Huffton Mifflin Harcourt under the title "AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," Lee is now the CEO of Synovation Ventures and has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, China's most important AI company.
In 1980, he built an AI system at Carnegie-Lellan University, defeating the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee appreciated the impact of U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project's Robotics Challenge, and asked when there would be more to reach out to the next philosophers.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have a hard time finding government funding.
"It's not the Chinese who are taking away the Academy's best, it's the corporates," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired highly successful people from universities to work with AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes could help support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think people who take a PhD in AI should have the ability to naturally get a green card," Lee said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are funding U.S. researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation is also funding people at academic institutions, but the level of academic activity in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at involving partners from industry and academia, and High House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, Dapra has announced that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
The U.S. government has been calling for a National Security Commission to be set up for artificial intelligence for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move intended to find a solution to a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union or NATO.
As Macedonia is a province within Greece, the name of its northern neighbor Macedonia represents a claim to its territory, so Greece, using its veto power, blocked Macedonia's requests for membership of either NATO or the European Union.
The two countries reached a settlement in June over the new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that changing the name could weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's population, which has a Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubt that this minimum requirement might not be met, as at least 50 percent of the voters would have to vote in order for the referendum to be valid.
The ballots read: "Do you agree to the membership of NATO and the European Union under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The renaming support group, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argues that the name change is the price Macedonia must pay for seeking access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO; Macedonia is one of only two countries to emerge from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for Macedonia's youth, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, and the European Union means a more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Giorgiev Skopje, a member of Skopje's Seventy-nine group.
A number of members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the referendum, regardless of whether it is legal or not.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes, the turnout percentage in an hour was 36 per cent, compared to just 16 per cent in a plebiscite.
"I have come to vote for my children, Europe is our place," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Thanevski, a voter at Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zayne and his son Dusuk cast their votes in a referendum on the renaming of the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strmica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, in front of tents prepared by plebiscite boycotters, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavrdakov prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs.
"We are not opposed to joining NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kawardhakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to take over as Macedonia, we can ask for help from China or Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
According to Prime Minister Sayeev, the current level of unemployment in Macedonia is more than 20 per cent, and the investment required for NATO membership will be enough.
“I believe the name change will be supported by a huge majority because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Mr. Zayev said after casting his vote.
He said, "The result will be the confirmation of our future."
According to the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters took part in the referendum - a percentage lower than the required percentage.
According to the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters took part in the referendum - a percentage lower than the required percentage.
Seventy percent said they would vote "yes."
In order for a referendum to be successful, a candidate must receive 50 percent of the vote and one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the government's policies, which turned the West in power last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero advances to break up the entire line of defence in the UK
Manchester City were beaten 2-0 by Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute as easily as he could.
At the start of this effort, the Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field.
Before hitting the ball into the open field, Aguero leapt through the middle of the three British defenders.
And then there's Aguero's four green jerseys.
Aguero dismissed a defensive player and duped a number of defensive players near Britain's goal face.
On seeing the sterling on the left side, Aguero handed over the ball.
This English forward, however, returned to Aguero as soon as he got the ball, and then the ball hit Aguero's right arm, bouncing off Britain's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," Pep Guardiola, the city's manager, told reporters.
"We played for 55-60 minutes.
Thats what had happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But in the Premier League, the Sky Blues were the first priority for Sterling.
The goal was scored in the 20th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball at the British border.
Leroy Zain Aguero was handed the ball by the left-arm spinner.
Shane hit the ball for a while, then handed it over to Sterling, who was on the move.
Before the ball reached the boundary, the Sky Blues forward hit it into the net.
In the Champions League group game, City will face Hohenheim at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neker-Arena in Sinheim, Germany.
Sherlock Holmes Wants to Play the Game of Life
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there is no reason to see another start.
But Scherzer, who has always wanted to compete, wants to get on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but that will only happen if the Rockies still have a playoff mentality and the Rockies have a lead in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockets beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are looking to win their first-ever division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, we know that the atmosphere in the crowd in Denver is going to rub in our fingers and the other team will be at the top of any point I face this year.
Why can't I compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but Scherzer, who has expressed interest in such a situation, is likely to allow it.
Scherzer, who is set to take his 34th start, threw a bullpen on Thursday and will be at his natural rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander, Shercerc, has 18-7 from 220 2/3 innings this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts.
Trump's tour of West Virginia
While talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly mentioned the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've done so far will depend on the outcome of November.
It's just one of the most important weeks of our lives.
"This is the biggest one -- I'm not competing, but actually I'm competing, and that's why I'm running everywhere, fighting for the magnificent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see the terrible, terrible terrorist groups of the Democrats, and you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to get back into power by whatever means necessary, i.e. with a little bit of humility and indifference as you can see.
They don't care who is being harassed to get power and control, they don't care who's stepping in, they want power and control, and we're not going to give them that."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “oppose and prevent.”
Asked what he saw in the last four days, Trump said Democrats were "abundantly angry, depraved, merciless and dishonest."
When the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking referred to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, the audience cheered.
Do you remember the answer?
You've been to the doc?
Oh, oh, what.
"No, no, no, no, I can't wait for that - it's really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a political party.
Forgiveness does not open the door to repentance.
I wasn't surprised when the momentary workers of my local party voted to give me a warning.
I'm the latest member of the Labour Party who's been told that they're not welcome.
I had the same experience with my colleague, Joanne Riya, who was a staunch advocate of antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The notice for Saturday's Nottingham East Labour meeting stated, "We want the meetings to be embeddable and productive."
In almost every eight years of my life as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night have been like that.
Sadly, this is not the nature of many meetings today, as the promise of "more kind, more gentle" politics has long since been forgotten; indeed, if such a promise had ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party cannot be excused from differing viewpoints, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
"As soon as Jeremy became the leader, my colleagues, who I had long thought were from a political standpoint similar to mine, hoped that I would go in the opposite direction and take views that I would never agree with, regarding national security and the single market as the European Union.
"When I speak to the public, there is a lot of shouting on social media, regardless of what the issue is, some people say that I should throw out my MP post and I should quit Central politics and I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I'm certainly more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I come across are related to political issues.
I am deeply moved by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face sexual or racial harassment every day but never shamelessly put their heads down.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is the fact that the levels of screaming are natural occurrences.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer an elaborate church, and the party is becoming narrower when it comes to every "no-confidence" motion, or when there is a change in the election rules.
For the past two years, I've been getting a lot of advice that I should lower my head and not talk so much so that I'm "precise."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a schoolboy. I was outraged by the way the government of Thatcher showed that my entire school classroom was really groundbreaking. Then, as a local councillor or a government minister, I always tried to provide better public services to those in need.
I have not hidden my politics under any circumstances, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should have any confusion about my policy understandings and the areas of my disagreement with the current leadership.
"To those promoting the Friday resolution, I want to say one thing: As the country advances toward a Brexit that offends homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But what I really want to convey is not for Nottingham Moment, but rather for Labour Party supporters and non-followers in my constituency: I am proud to serve you, and I can assure you that I will not be deterred from interfering in what I believe to be in the best interest of all of you, for threats to scuttle my position or political move.

Aries 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable ore to the fore
While the previous two draws may have put the final result on a nearly curve, it is certain that Ayr deserved a victory in today's, surprisingly fun Tennants Premiership match.
The top two teams on the list are the top 10.
In short, it was the best defense and their courage to test the chances that put the team ahead, and coach Peter Murchi has every right to be happy.
"I'm happy that in all the matches so far, our ability has been tested and they still haven't felt defeat, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie commented: "Yesss owes Ayr, they were the ones who took the lead in testing the possibilities."
Frasier Climo scored the goal in the 14th minute of the Grand Andersen's attempt, which put Ayr in the lead, but through the Warriors, the yellow card awarded to Scotland's Cap Rory Hughes for the contest, gave Melrose a chance, but the effort of Jason Buggot was fruitless.
The ore was put into the Klimo lead with a penalty, and before that, it was almost half-time for Klimo to score a solo effort, 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and they were able to narrow the gap between the scores by 5 points when Patrick Anderson's effort put Baggott on target.
Ruyarid Nott suffered a serious injury and the game was called off for a long time, and when the match resumed, the ore rebounded, and Stafford McDowell's effort brought Klimo to the goal.
The temporary captain was given a yellow card, and Bruce Colvin was unable to reach the goal as he was given a chance by Melrose in the ring of intense pressure.
Although the home side started to bounce back, when Hutchinson was given a yellow card for pushing Klimo without a ball on the penalty lineout, MacPherson made an effort by rushing to the side of the ore that was advancing.
Climo scored again, as he did when the match resumed, before taking the box kick from David Armstrong's Cauldron Rowe and sending Gregor Henry from the edge of the field for his fifth attempt at home.
A game-changer in the restaurant industry
This came to the fore when Ford Kiran took over as the director of a restaurant company licensed by Still Game star Ford Kieran.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, who also co-stars with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield in the show.
The star couple's ninth series has been announced to be out soon and it will be the final series of the show and it seems Kiernan is busy planning his life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Mon Ltd.
The actor is yet to comment on the news, but a Scottish Sun source has hinted that Kiernan is planning to focus on Glasgow's "growing rental business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, landlocked, hopes the court will open the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the Rigging-Clade Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is hoisted on government buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the same motto: “By right the ocean is ours.
It is our duty to restore it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, it is still vividly remembered that in the bloody resource dispute of the 19th century, Chile was forced to cede its coastline - once again a desire to sail across the Pacific Ocean.
Although this hope has been inside for decades, it is reaching its peak now, as Bolivia has been waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and the country certainly expects the outcome with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calassadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will look sympathetically at Bolivia's claim, and after decades of volatile negotiations, they think Chile is obliged to consider allowing Bolivia a way with absolute authority to the sea.
Bolivia's most influential local president, Evo Morales, who has to face a controversial battle for reelection next year, has a lot to look forward to Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed last August.
According to some analysts, it is unlikely that the court will pronounce the verdict in Bolivia's favour, because even if the court says in its favour, nothing is going to happen.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on a matter within the territory of Chile, and has stipulated that the outcome of the negotiations will not be determined.
Pas Sarate, a Chilean expert on international law, said the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments, indicating that the case was "not complicated."
Instead of taking Bolivia's goal forward, developments over the past four years may have been a setback to this goal.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Sarat<0xC3><0xA9> said.
Morales aggressive rhetoric may have also spilled over into what may have been Chiles good view of Bolivia, they noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at times, but it will be difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Weltz<0xC3><0xA9>, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, denied the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
He said Monday's ruling was a "wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreements" related to bilateral interests.
Morales has denied that the issue of the seas is a stepping stone to his political gains - and that he is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents.
"Bolivia should never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This is an opportunity to change the way we think about the future."
North Korea won't give up its nuclear weapons until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the country would not denuclearize those who can trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to live up to its commitments made at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came three months after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began trying to restart stalled nuclear diplomatic talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that continuing subacute ailments and the US's reluctance to end the Korean War would only be a "pipe dream" if North Korea was ever to be dragged to its knees.
First, the U.S. is reluctant to accept Pyongyang's declaration without any significant disarmament effort.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
There is widespread uncertainty as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning a warhead, which could be seen as the only way to ensure the security of the country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest line-up of the huge hat collection coming soon to High Street near you has been showcased in Parisian fashion
If you want to increase the size of the hat collection or completely hide the tail, you don't need to search any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a line of crazy-looking oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway.
This summer, Instagram has been overtaken by hats that seem to be completely impractical, and the designers have brought their eye-catching creations to the ramp.
Valentino's master piece was a wide-brimmed, over-the-top light brown hat with wide edges, like a moustache on the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry - embroidered watermelons, a magician’s hat, and a pineapple <0xE2><0x80><0x93> but these hats were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also lighted a collection of strange masks, many of which are suitable for use in halloween.
These colorful masks stitched the lips of many and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than Horticulture.
One creation reminded me of a complete scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're in great shape, you're in luck.
According to style-watchers, these large-sized hats will soon be available in shops near you as well.
These large sized hats came in the form of 'La Bomba', a two-foot wide-edged, vicole hat that everyone wore, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajowski.
The cult label behind the caps that didn't go viral on social media, which led to another huge creation, was a large straw beach bag, like a swimsuit, and the models wore it on the ramp.
It was a unique creation from the collection of the Parish Fashion Week's La Riviera SS19, a burnt-orange refiya bag with a white leather handle on top, with a rafiya kunjir hair cut off.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to Female: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>I hope to see big hats and beach bags on High Street next summer <0xE2><0x80><0x93> because the designer has made a big impact, so it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.’
John Edwards: Language Skills Needed for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and with another set of exceptional exam results, continued in 2018, individual and collective success in sports, music and other community endeavors strengthening academic excellence.
Represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools strive to provide the best possible service standards for students and parents.
The goal of free schools is to prepare students for advanced higher education, for careers they have chosen, and for their position as global citizens.
As an educational field where a unique school curriculum can be designed and implemented, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes over his head.
But when I speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that when she wants to build relationships with people from other countries and win their trust, she cannot rely solely on English.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league charts with the highest success rate within independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS schools, which have 74 schools as members, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher A grade in Mandarin, 72 per cent of students studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that children and students will most likely need in the future.
As with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere, languages are now considered a subject of choice.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the challenges faced by employers were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
These skills are inexhaustible in a globalized world, where languages are needed for future employment opportunities.
Whatever may be the career path chosen, if the candidates have learned a second language, they will have long-term expertise like this so that they can really take the lead in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, knowing the person in multiple languages will naturally put him far ahead of the competition.
According to the results of the YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents said they were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, while 15 per cent said French was the only foreign language they knew.
That's why investing in language teaching is becoming an important topic for today's children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those with language proficiency in developing countries, will give children more of a chance to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
While most schools will focus on more classical modern languages, such as Mandarin or Japanese, other schools will teach languages that are considered important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a handful of languages to choose from within independent schools with teachers who specialize in the foreign language field.
Although we do not know what the future holds, Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children to succeed in life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed.
In a global business environment, it is not impossible to deny that languages will continue to be an indispensable part of the future of the country, and therefore should be reflected in education as well.
Of course, truly modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, variety and excellence for the children of Scotland.
Ai Fut Bien Le Fare.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron will play for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
This is the first time LeBron James will be playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's not yet known how long James will play.
"Time will be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' reporter, Mike Treadle, tweeted that James would only be playing for a limited time.
Following his first practice this week, he asked James about the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, in places with a large number of followers, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to securing the vote for his nominee on the Supreme Court, Trump also aims to increase popular support ahead of the mid-term elections due in November, as there are widespread fears that the Republican party will lose control of Congress when the polls are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on September 29, 2018 at 7pm Eastern Time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which is marred by allegations of sexual misconduct against him, and a Senate confirmation vote that was due to be held as the FBI investigates the matter has been postponed by a week.
The primary goal of this conference is to give a boost to the Republican Party, which faces the November election.
According to Reuters, the goal of the five rallies next week is to "energize volunteers and supporters as the party seeks to maintain and increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives."
"Control of Congress is very critical to the president's agenda, so as we heat up the campaign, he will visit as many states as he can," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, which will be organized at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, "will attract followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the attention of the Pittsburgh media".
Trump had visited West Virginia last month as well, and it would be his second visit with Saturday's rally, which Trump won in the state with more than 40 percent of the vote in the 2016 election.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is in the minority.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey to have a president come to the forefront of opinion polls," Simon Heyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA show fighting spirit to keep hopes alive as they storm into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon 'Forsoms' may have been exactly what was needed for this year's Ryder Cup.
While the dynamics of the game are entirely a fabricated command, it's something that players actually believe in, especially in matches like this.
If so, where is the pre-order now?
"They were six points ahead, now they're four, so I guess that's a small jump for us," said Jordan Spieth as he left the game.
With 12 games to go, Europe are four points ahead of them.
However, as Spieth puts it, Americans think the wind is a little too much for them and a lot to be proud of. Spieth and Justin Thomas’s play is nothing short of inspiring them. The two of them have played together all day and are proud to have scored four to three points.
In the case of Green Bay's defensive lineman, he's a role model for others.
After playing two games, both Spieth and Thomas were two points behind, when a vital putt was made to get the match into four all-squares.
His dog, who won the game at 15, also received the same cheers as he told people that he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"What you really need to do is dig deep and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each player.
18 games to prove it.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players in the last two days with more points than Spieth and Thomas.
The other four are from Europe, but they don't share the same fate.
The only pair that didn't take a bogey shot on Saturday afternoon was "Mollywood". But they dropped the bogey shots on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and on Friday morning after the last nine holes played.
They're the players who have to lose on Sunday, and the way their energy seems to flow around you from the loudspeaker. When the sun sets over the Le Golf Nationals, there's no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to ensure a European victory.
They both play different games at the same time.
However, talking about European greatness remains a thing of the time.
Sergio Garcia, the hero of the foreballs of the morning, when he was playing in pairs with Alex Noran, was unnerved by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson.
In the first nine holes, a bogey and two doubles pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit that was too difficult to recover.
No one is going to make you cry on Sunday.
It's interesting to see foreboding and foreboding because of the mutuality between pairs, the advice they give to each other, the advice they don't give, and the way any strategy can change in an instant.
Europe, which has so far played well as a team, is going to have a good lead for the final day. But this foursome session has shown that Team USA, some of them, especially their country, have a fighting spirit.
Europe lead 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe, which has risen from Saturday's Fourboles and Foursomes to a 10-6 lead over the United States, is going to be a healthy achievement for the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Inspired pairings Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have led the way in scoring four points at the Le Golf National with two wins over Tiger Woods who are struggling to play.
Two years ago, while trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hasseltine, Thomas John's European side led the series 3-1 in the morning foreballs and dominated the high-scoring American side.
Although the U.S. had more resistance in Foursoms by winning two matches, it was not enough to reduce.
If the team wants to keep the title, they need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row. At the same time, he is the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four games, while Molinari, also known as "Mollywood" after an exciting weekend.
They beat Woods and Patrick Read in foreballs, and then came together to beat the self-confident Woods and the American newcomer Bryson DeCambue, 5&4, even more impressively.
Woods, who pulled in two games on Saturday, showed explosive performances but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four in fours, seven in a row.
Justine Ross, who was laid to rest for the morning's fourballs, came back to form with Henrik Stenson to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cope 2&1.
However, on that pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris, Europe couldn't make it all their own.
Three-time major winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, scored two points for the United States on Saturday.
In the foreballs, they went on to win the hard-fought 2&1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and then in the foreplays, Poulter and Rory McIlroy, who lost their opening two holes, came back to beat 4&3.
Although Furyk's side needed a draw to keep the trophy in the hands of the holders, only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a four-point loss to the singles.
Even though it's been a couple of days, I think Sunday's game is going to be better.
North Korea says there is "no way out" of unilateral disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had increased distrust in the United States and there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong said at the annual United Nations General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "substantial steps for good," including halting nuclear tests and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and taking a pledge not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not received any response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., we can't have faith in our national security and we have no way of disarming ourselves unilaterally in such circumstances."
Although Ri reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to its "stage-by-stage" approach to denuclearization, his statement assumes significance as Pyongyang has not ruled out unilateral denuclearization, as it has done in the past.
He also referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the summit in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promised to ensure the security of North Korea; the first summit was held in Singapore where an active US president and a North Korean leader met.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. wants Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls for the easing of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is pushing for 'first nuclear disarmament' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal forcibly and even to oppose the 'declaration that the war is over'," Ri said.
"The notion that we'll bend to our knees with sanctions is a pipe dream for people who don't know about us."
"The problem is that our confidence is growing because of the continuing sanctions."
He did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a U.S. leader said at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, referring to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, the minister added: “The party on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the US, and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such an end.”
Even so, the tone of Ri's current speech was dramatically different from that of his speech at the UN last year. Ri told the UN that Trump's calling Kim a "rocket man" was a "suicide attempt" and that North Korean rockets aimed at the US mainland were necessary.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in denuclearizing, but said there was still much more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit, adding that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that Pyongyang should be paid by the UN Security Council for the actions it has taken so far.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “The implementation of the sanctions proposed by the Security Council must remain energetic until full, final and verifiable denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council has unanimously raised sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeo was seen on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
North Korea condemned Pyongyang, saying it was making progress, but said that within a few hours after his departure, he had raised "requirements such as the raising of gangsters."
North Korea, in its meeting with Moon earlier this month, had promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that he was demanding "equal measures" - security guarantees in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn the course to get enough sleep
This year, a new course was introduced to all students at Harvard University to help them get more sleep and combat the growing "macho" culture of learning through the night, including caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's top university often lack clarity on the basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course is designed by Charles Seessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first course of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>I’m in my last year, what’s the matter with me now?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, provides students with the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of University Health Services, said the decision to introduce the course came after students were found to be experiencing severe sleep deprivation over the course of the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, they can hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep-wake time.
In another study, students were asked how long-term sleep deprivation increased their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages students to think about their signage routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But just as you have the right to know the health consequences of choosing to smoke, we believe they have the right to know as well."
He said that a culture that takes pride in saying 'learned without sleep' still exists, and that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - while not sleeping to avoid weight gain we are pushing the brain into starvation mode, which results in a sustained hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped design the course for Professor Sisler, who attended the class in his first year at Harvard last year.
He stated that the said course opened his eyes and prompted him to conduct the said course throughout the campus.
As a next step, he expects all postgraduate students to be asked to complete a similar study plan, before joining a competition-based institution.
Professor Seysler recommended that students who are alarmed should consider the timing of sleep and wakefulness, and should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting; this blue light can degrade your circadian rhythm in the usual way, causing problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 0 Rangers: Meng’s goal defeats Gerard’s players
When Dolly Menga's foot left Steven Gerrard's shattered team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston, the Rangers once again felt the strain of being away from their regular left foot.
Since their 4<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1 victory at St Johnston in February, the Ibrox side has been looking to register their first away win, but Gary Holt's team, as manager of Gerard's, only suffered their second defeat in 18 games, eight points behind Hartz, the unmanageable captain of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the underwhelming Rangers didn't feel like it was going to come back.
The Rangers now slipped to sixth while Livingstone climbed up to third, only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
It would be more difficult for the Rangers to take care of Linsman Art and Span by hitting an object that seems to have been thrown at the back of the line.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that reached the finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, dropped the same Livi 11 last week that scored a point from Harts. The well-trained team must have made him so happy that he was able to suffocate his opponents at every stage.
Although the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingstone handled the ball well enough to get them.
They should have scored in the second minute of the game when Menga's first Leif pass sent Scott Pitman to Allan McGregor's goalpost, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
Although a brilliant free-kick by Keegan Jacobs came close to Captain Craig Halkett, his defensive ally Alan Lithgow only managed to score a shot in the back post.
Despite the loss, the Raiders showed more confidence in their offensive line.
When Alfredo Morlos and Steven Lawless met in the 15th minute, it seemed certain that he had received a penalty, but the Colombian's appeal was rejected by the referee Steven Thomson.
The first half saw just two shots from the Rangers, but a header by Laszana Colibaly and a kick by Ovie Izaria did not bother Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
No one can deny that Livi's 34th-minute goal could have been against the course of the game, but given their agreement, they deserved it.
The Rangers once again failed to manage a setpiece of Jacob's brilliance.
When Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield didn't respond. Robinson chose Meng to keep his calm and complete what was simple.
Gerrard responded by dropping Ryan Kent instead of Colibaly at break. The change almost brought about a sudden shock. He, who was playing with the wing, made a move with Morlos, but the heartwarming Kelley jumped out of his line to stop it.
Livingston, however, kept the visitors in the game, and Lithgow and Halkett took long shots one after the other.
Holt's side could have pulled off their lead in the final stages, but McGregor continued to deny Jacobs and Lithgow opportunities.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, argued for another late penalty when he teamed up with Jacobs, but again Thomson denied it.
Panchangam: Founder of the Geiger Counter
Now a page from our "Sun Day Morning" Panchangam: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... The day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to an instrument known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a major reference point for science, has become the mainstay of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms that produce radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is it breaking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
Despite its name, it still exists today.
The new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to "find" the motherfucking cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment.
It involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and transplanting them into a lab.
Then, they can 'see' a common protein that is responsible for many cancers and then inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial of a vaccine in patients with a variety of cancers has shown promising future results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, their ovarian cancer disappeared over a period of more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein known as HER2, which causes many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a vaccine with a very promising future.”
Prof. Berzofsky explained that HER2 influences the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating leukemia.
After his presence in the SNL, Kanye West, wearing a giant hat, has come out in support of Trump.
But that's not all
After an unrelated performance that heaped praise on U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020, people booed Kanye West during a live show on Saturday night.
After singing the third, Ghost Town, wearing the Make America Great hat that night, he railed against the Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, they say, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>How do you like racist Trump?’
"If I had been born in the United States, I would have died a long time ago," he said.
With regard to the sexual assault rights raised by Christine Blasey Ford, the SNL show began with a skit starring Matt Damon, jeopardizing Brett Kavanaugh's affidavit before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Though not broadcast, the footage of West's futility was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
By posting this, it's not clear whether Rock tried to mock the West.
In addition, he complained to the Western audience that he felt very uncomfortable on the stage wearing a hat.
"They scared me on the spot.
She said, “Don’t wear that hat and don’t go there.”
They threatened me!
"They say I'm in a sinking place," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the place where I drowned? Wear my Superman cape because it means you can't tell me what I should do," he said, adding that he wanted the world to move on.
"Test your love."
After hearing his comments, Variety reported that at least two times the audience was in awe of Cuvie and SNL cast members, where one told the publication: "The entire studio fell into mortal silence."
West is portrayed as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
A lot of people were surprised to hear the song "I Love It" by West wearing a Periyar bottle.
West received support from conservative group TP USA's Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing out in the crowd."
But Karen Hunter, who hosted the talk show, tweeted that West was "just how he was, and that's absolutely amazing."
"But I will not decide to pay a reward (to buy his music or clothes or support his "art") for someone I believe has embraced and vomited an ideology that is harmful to my community."
He is free.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, Rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, tweeting that he was "the man who was officially known as Kanye West."
West isn't the first artist to change his name, and he's following in Diddy's footsteps as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
West's fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, and he was previously known as Prince.
A man has been charged with murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Mumbai.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been accused of sexual assault.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the thirty-one-year-old actor attacked Macho Hero's stereotype by saying that young boys believe that they need to be tough to be respected for such roles on the screen.
In an interview allotted to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem of the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to his co-star Rose Leslie (31) in Game of Thrones, admitted that he "certainly" believes he needs to address the issue.
“I now feel personally, very strongly <0xE2><0x80><0x93> where did we go wrong with regard to masculinity?” he asked.
“What do we teach the growing boys, with respect to the problem we see now?”
Since there are a lot of male characters in TV shows, Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What are some of the characteristics that young boys need to have in order to be men, as taught on TV and on the streets?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change this situation?
“There’s something wrong with the young people.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not do the prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and that he was "tired of the plots and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which is the story of a film producer and his rapist brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that brought him out of Game of Thrones is that he thinks he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so that show gave me a future family and a life to move on," he said.
In this Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played the role of John Snow's girlfriend, Yegrite.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions from infected individuals.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said that the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost disappeared.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is growing at a rate of one lakh per year.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
China abolished homosexuality as a criminal offence in 1997, although discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.
Because of conservative values that persist in the country, studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women themselves.
Men often suffer from sexual problems because they don't have enough sex.
In an effort to address this problem, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV drugs universally available since 2003.
Maxina Waters said her staff and GOP senators' data had not been compromised, calling the allegations "dangerous lies" and a "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat stressed that these were only claims made by "extremely right-wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked online shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanagh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office, and the information of a member of the Waters staff was released.
"This baseless allegation is absolutely false and completely false," Waters continued.
There has been compromise on the identity, personal information and security of one of my employees as a result of these false and false allegations, but my employee is not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is totally false and totally false.
Waters' statement went online, inviting criticism from many, including former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"There's a lot of anger in this denial," Fletcher wrote.
"It shows that they don't have the passion to become a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
Do not be arrogant.
Do not question the motives of the accused person.
We need to be calm and peaceful."
Fletcher was trying to compare Waters’ response to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics had accused of being seen as too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's a great event," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these bogus claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to light and that they are held legally liable for all their acts of causing damage or danger to all my employees or any of my employees," they continued.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's Powerless Spy Spoof
Brexit has become a method of seeking prominence in any new British-inspired film, and it seems to apply to this second part of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - the franchise that began in 2003 with the film 'Johnny English' and made a comeback in 2011 with the film 'Johnny English Reborn'.
Is this self-serving satire on the issue of how absurd we are as a nation, a new export opportunity?
In any case, the blindfolded, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has a second chance at fattening things up - more than anything else, his signaling is a vast comic creation designed for non-English-speaking, film-affiliated areas.
Of course he's a dull secret agent, from weird hypocritical to elegantly charming, but he's also made Mr. Bean's fantasies and the chariots of fire with the theme of the London 2012 Olympics feel like a trap for a young man who donates a single note to the tune.
In Barclaycard TV commercials that no one remembers now, he is actually based on Atkinson himself, a traveler and a mysterious man.
This latest Johnny English release has one or two good motifs.
I liked Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval-era armor, with rotating blades firmly on the helmet for a while.
Atkinson's ability to physically poke fun is evident in the film, but the jokes have no power, and are strangely overpowering, especially during the era when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently adding comedy to themselves as a ingredient.
I feel that the humor in the film is more designed for children than adults, and I have never experienced Johnny English's crazy adventures as new or more focused than the silent movie funniest Atkinson played as Mr. Bean.
This is a film where the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super secret network and reveals the identity of all British agents working in the field of secret intelligence, while disappointing the on-duty agent - it's a pity that Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a minor role.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is already politically battered by popularity, who is proud and all-consuming. The truth is that even though Emma Thomson does a great job of portraying this character, such as Theresa May, they have nothing more to do in the script.
Since the personal details of all the spies who are actively working in the intelligence domain have been leaked, the prime minister's intelligence advisers inform them that someone who has retired needs to be brought in.
Johny is an unorthodox Englishman, working as a schoolmaster at a wealthy institution, but the party teaches 'off-the-record' lessons on how to perform 'undercover' activities: there are some good interactions here, and Johny teaches the School of Rock-Type Academy English spying.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an urgent briefing and reunited with his longtime classmate, Bog, who has been played by Ben Miller again.
Bug is now married, and his wife is a sub-marine commander, destroying Vicki Pepperdine in this 'jolly-hockey-stick' role.
Batman and Robin are back in the Secret Service of Here Magisti, and "Work" has begun, but things are getting worse as they face Vashya Sundari, who plays Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister dangerously falls into the trap of the powerful tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Jake Lacy plays Jason Volta, a notorious billionaire.
English and Buff begin a procession of artificial concoctions: they set fire to a French restaurant in the guise of waiters; they smuggle themselves abroad in Volta's luxury boat and make a mess; John English things up as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
They have certainly brought out all the talent for this part of the film, but since it is so melodious and hilarious, it is like watching a little TV in total.
It's an average movie.
When I saw other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t help but think: Can the British film industry play a role that suits the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
The Labour Party has rejected a proposal to allow Britons to work four days a week and earn five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a progressive plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but buy five days' wages.
According to reports, the party wants the profits generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on to the workers by the company's capitalists by giving them an extra day off.
If this happens, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but will be able to buy back the old pay itself.
According to news sources, the idea is in line with the partys economic agenda and the party is planning to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
As a means of getting workers to benefit from the changing economy, the idea of a four-day work week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress.
A senior leader of the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ideal aspiration for the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and as the party’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse a four-day week, and the Green Party offered a four-day week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present this ambition is not accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>The idea of a four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.’
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profit-earners" in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in white companies may not get their full share back because a labor government may be able to charge "deductions" based on perceived wrongdoings.
He confirmed that there are plans to induct workers on company boards and create exclusive honorary funds for handing over 10 per cent stake in private sector firms to employees.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say the FBI investigation will change their minds in 60 minutes
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which delayed a final vote to nominate him to the Supreme Court by more than a week, raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings would prompt any Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelli, author of "60 Minutes C," asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if finding anything would lead to their decision to change.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to trial and I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after that allegation came out, I called him and asked him, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Did you do this?’
He showed determination, determination, and unflinching determination."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be fixed in stone.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and that’s just an indictment shot,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett bravely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Balsey Ford.
"No one has been able to confirm his name.
This is a 36 year old story.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted in New York this Saturday, with impressive performances by the stars at the annual music event, as well as a notable mission to: Eradicate the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to take part in the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shan Mendis, but also to raise awareness of the program's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that works with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get a free ticket to attend this event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert lovers need to perform a number of tasks or “actions”; these activities include volunteering or emailing or calling a world leader or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
With only 12 years to go, how successful has the Global Citizen been?
Is giving people a free concert ticket as a reward, a fundamental way to persuade people to respond favorably to a call to action, or is it a different form of philanthropy <0xE2><0x80><0x93> a condition that people think makes a real difference <0xE2><0x80><0x93> by signing an online complaint or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, helping a platform of different goals.
The measures have helped push world leaders to announce pledges and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are aimed at driving mobility into the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had selected 390 assurances and declarations derived from their operations, and distributed or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the money they have raised so far has had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
After receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, one of the key assurances is that they have been offered $35 million to help the country end malnutrition in Rwanda. The Power of Now is a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to the full potential of their potential."
"With the support of the UK government, donors and national governments, and global citizens like you, we can bring the social injustice of malnutrition to a complete stop in history," Tracy Ulman, the power-of-nutrient ambassador, told a crowd at a live music event in London in April 2018.
After taking more than 5,000 steps calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a programme called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children as nutrition.
One of the frequently asked questions on its website is the question “Why do you think extreme poverty can be ended?”
Global Citizen replied: “It’s going to be a long and hard road <0xE2><0x80><0x93> sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement in front of us, we will win because when we come together, we are stronger.
This year's event in New York will be hosted by Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Moni, while Deborah-Lee Furness and Huff Jackman will host the event.
The U.S. could use the navy as a "siege" to block Russian energy exports.
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed that Washington could seek the Navy's help "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East, according to the report.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria was a means of finding new markets, and it should be noted that Russia was acting because it had been invited by the legitimate government in Syria.
"I believe they're interfering in the Middle East because they want to be the bearer of energy in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe and in the South of Europe," he said.
According to this official, there are ways and means to solve this.
"With our navy, the United States has the ability to ensure that ocean lanes remain open, block their energy if necessary, and ensure it doesn't reach the market," he said.
He was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, and pointed out that in practice, the two are one and the same.
Referring to Russia as a "single-engineered horse" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels, he said the economy's overrun with Iran and Russia is "more or less making the most of the fuels and using one instead of the other."
The Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, barring Russia.
For that, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Germany a "prisoner" of Berlin Moscow.
Moscow reiterated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the economic reasons behind Washington's fierce opposition to the project are an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a backlash from Germany, and Germany re-affirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big headache for me when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will make a "decisive decision" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would make a "decisive decision" regarding running for president following the midterm elections.
She confirmed that she would consider competing at a town hall event in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set right our broken government and demand that the government have a woman on top of it," she said.
“After November 6, I will be taking my running for president seriously.”
During the town hall, Warren assessed him by saying that President Donald Trump was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before we can vote," he tweeted on Friday.
However, according to an opinion poll that came out on Thursday, the majority of people in Warren's own constituency are of the opinion that Warren should not run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run.
Thirty-five percent of respondents supported such a measure.
Former governor Deval Patrick received the most support in the opinion poll, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy, while 48 percent opposed it.
Other high profile Democratic leaders who are likely to contest the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially decide on the issue in January.
Sarah Palin speaks out about the PTSD of track milk at Donald Trump's rally
After joining the army in September, Trak Palin (26) spent nearly a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"When I think about what my own son was going through and what he was going through when he came back, I can understand the trauma of the other families who are suffering from PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers bring with them when they return home," she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as an "elephant in the room," "they come back a little bit differently, they come back tersely, they think, they think they get some respect for what every member of the military and the air force has given the country," she said of her son and others who have retired from the military.
He was arrested Monday from Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, who had a weapon when he assaulted the woman and was intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and D.C. to challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of lynchings or domestic violence.
Representatives from 10 states and the District of Columbia filed a 'Friend-of-the-Court Brief' in Washington on Friday in support of a person seeking asylum and opposing the new policy.
The full name of the complainant in the "Grace vs. Sessions" lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said she was harassed by her partner and "children who are members of criminal gangs," but her application for asylum was rejected by US officials on June 20.
They were arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where widespread attacks and domestic violence by criminal gangs are taking place, where large numbers of applicants for asylum in the US come from.
In 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals repealed the U.S. asylum policy that allowed asylum seekers fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum if they did not have documents.
In a statement issued Friday, District Attorney General Carl Riessin said the new law "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all claims for asylum be settled based on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, but such a ban violates that principle," the court said.
Lawyers then argued in a briefing, saying that the policy of denying entry to immigrants hurt the U.S. economy, with asylum seekers more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to ensure that asylum seekers who escaped attacks from criminal gangs and domestic violence could no longer be granted asylum.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Refuge is never intended to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day - even all the serious ones.
Search and rescue operations underway in Palu as the death toll in Palu has doubled
The situation was even worse for the survivors.
"The pressure that is being felt is severe," said Risa Kusumah, a 30-year-old mother of a boy with a fever, comforting him at one of the evacuation centers in the troubled city of Palu.
"The ambulances are arriving every minute.
There's no clean water."
Residents could be seen returning to their dilapidated homes, picking up stuff soaked in water and trying to find anything that could be moved to safer routes.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake has left hundreds of people injured and destroyed hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwee Harris, who suffered a fracture in the back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where the patients were being treated outside the building due to continuous strong tremors.
When he and his wife, who lived on the fifth floor of the hotel, were shaken by the earthquake, Dwyer Harris' eyes were filled with tears.
"We didn't have time to defend ourselves.
I feel like I'm stuck to the rubble of the wall," Harris told The Associated Press, adding that she and her family had come to the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I didn't hear a sound.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are somewhere safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "targeting" with propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper about the bipartisan gains of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread China's propaganda.
The US president had referred to a supplement provided by China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register - Iowa State's best-selling newspaper - after he accused China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections due to be held on November 6.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election were a new step in intensifying Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, relations between Beijing and Washington have been embroiled in an escalating trade war, with the two countries frequently increasing import tariffs on each other's goods.
In the trade war, China had earlier increased import tariffs in retaliation to the US, with economists in China and the US saying the new tariffs were designed to target import firms in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and long-serving governor of Iowa and owner of one of the largest firms exporting agricultural products to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling the threat by publishing Propaganda in our own independent media," wrote Bransted in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By issuing an ad paid for in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the freedom of expression and freedom of the press that is being nurtured in the United States to propagate propaganda," Brandstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here on the news stands on the streets of Beijing, you will see limited voices of dissent, and no real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people may have about China's chaotic economic path, because the media is under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also wrote that his article had "failed to become one of China's leading newspapers from its promise to be published," but did not mention which newspaper it was.
As the Kavanaugh caucus continues, Republicans will crack down on female voters before the midterm elections, analysts say
Many top Republican party leaders, including political analysts, have warned that during the upcoming midterm elections, the Republican party will face setbacks, especially from women, as the Supreme Court sided with nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sex scandals and would defend him.
The sentiment around this is very high, and it appears that most Republicans already want to go ahead with a vote.
“There is no going back,” wrote Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reehr said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute demand for an FBI investigation may not be enough to pacify angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow or November," Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group Mooon, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
Despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's affidavit, the Judiciary Committee controlled by the Republicans decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, and on Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the corridor of the Senate and chanted "November is coming!"
"The Democratic Party's enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu, who conducts political analysis without bias, told the Rothenberg news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But there is still a way to go, especially among women voters inclined back and forth in the suburbs, and young people between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't like the president but don't vote often."
Even before Ford's ad-affidavit, which details allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested a backlash would follow if the Republican went ahead with the confirmation.
"This is troubling the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote on whether to be appointed to the Kavanaugh bench, it's about the way Republicans have handled this allegation and how Republicans have treated the victim," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, the group that assists the Democrats in their election, said.
However, in the context of the affidavits of Ford and Kavanagh, Americans seem to be divided on who to trust, and they are a little more inclined to trust Kavanagh.
A new opinion poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents believed in the authenticity of Ford’s affidavit, while 35 percent said they believed in Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believe Cavanogo lied to them in his affidavit, and only 30 per cent said so about Ford.
Following a request from Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was attacked by a drunkard at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitalia.
World Wide Web founder to launch new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The company, named Inrupt, is the latest project in this technology legend, built on Berners-Lee's own open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview granted to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the motive behind the intruder was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said.
"This is a historic event."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "individual online data store" or a POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This technology is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available in a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which types of information can be accessed by which people.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
"John Bruce, CEO of Intrap, said, ""The idea behind Intrap is to be a company that provides resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone."
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce and IBM, some on-staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Intrap website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that will make all of their business models go head-to-head overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post published in the media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Irupt's mission is to "provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the Net Neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"In this next era of the web, I'm incredibly optimistic," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard van: Victoria Cross-winning priest remembered for his role in World War I
One hundred years later, the only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross for his role as a fighter in World War I was commemorated by his own countrymen.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vane was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellingleys and Lehigh Court.
However, four days later, he was assassinated by a sniper, whom he never knew was awarded the highest British military honor.
Two of his grandchildren unveiled the monument at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Van, one of his grandsons, said the unveiling of the stone was "vigorous symbolism" exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, published on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane led his battalion across the canal de Saint-Quentin, "through thick snow and with cartridges fired from field and automatics."
He then leapt into the firing line, exhibiting "great aggression," leaping solo into a field-gun column, advancing his battalion and dropping three of his enemy soldiers.
A month before the end of the war, on October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane was killed by a German sniper.
"I know I haven't been able to live up to the example set by my grandfather, but that humbles me," said seventy-two-year-old Michael Vane.
He and his brother Dr. James Vane laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "extremely proud to be playing his role at the parade," adding, "The bravery of a true hero is proven by the support that so many people give."
MMA fans had to sleep through the night to see the Bellator 206.
Imagine what it would be like if you had been up all night to see the crowded Bellator 206 and were denied this important event.
The bill, from San Jose, features 13 fights, including six on the main card, and is live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were fighting, viewers in the UK were shocked when coverage shifted to the Peppa Pig.
They were desperate to get out of bed in the morning.
A fan on Twitter wrote that the screen turned into a "kind of dirty joke" for children's cartoons.
"Because of government regulation, they had to switch to a children's program as it was not appropriate to broadcast that content at 6 a.m.," Dave Shorts, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
The pig, yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Koecker, said the company would try to schedule more events in the UK in the future.
"When I think about replay, I think we can fix this problem," Kocker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't fix it until Sunday is our time and Monday is their time."
But we are trying to solve it.
Trust me, when the coverage changed, a lot of text messages flew here and there, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it and at first we thought it was a technical glitch.
But that was not the case.
I can assure you that it won't happen again.
We've had six fights - five of which we've been fighting - and I think we've given the audience more than we needed.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly says he felt 'uncompassionate' about sex
Olympic swimmer Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this inspired Daly to win.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which features Lauren Lavern, he spoke about gay rights that give others "hope."
He said he has lost interest in being an Olympian.
Kirsty Young, who has been a regular presenter of the show for a long time, was on leave for several months due to illness.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> sat on Laven's first program as shipwrecked, saying that he felt "less" than others when he was growing up because "the society did not approve of his liking of boys and girls alike."
He said: “The feeling of inferiority and being different than others are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed to this day.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something," so he didn't get discouraged when everyone finally came to know about his sexuality.
Having won the bronze medal twice at the Olympics, Dali has now become a big LGBT campaigner, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to request more countries to legalize heterosexuality.
He said he was open about it because he felt lucky to live in public without any adverse consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
Three-time world champion Daly said he was "surprised" to have fallen in love with a man, the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her, but he said age difference was never an issue.
"When you went through so much hardship at such a young age - competing for the first time at the Olympics at the age of 14 when Dali's father died of cancer three years later - it was difficult to meet someone of the same age who had experienced the same heights and depths as him," he said.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Daly, and this changed his "whole perspective," Daly said.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have talked about 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"There are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
It's my Olympic gold medal."
In 2011, at the age of 40, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> was diagnosed with brain cancer, bearing the same name as his late father Robert.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said his father never accepted that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if there were still tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be at the forefront.
"But I couldn't say 'Dad won't be there until I see him in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he took his last breath, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Dali competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to sink a motherland in front of a crowd at an Olympic Games, and there couldn't have been a better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his selection of his first song <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Proud by Heather Sman <0xE2><0x80><0x93> and this song resonated in him until the Olympics, when he still had a flutter when he heard this song.
Desert Island Discs Sunday at 11:15 BST is on BBC Radio 4.
Michael Jackson wasn't in the best of form on Sunday.
American Phil Mickelson will make history when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to pick up his form so that it doesn't become an unpleasant milestone.
Captain Jim Furyk released Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time in the history of the two-year-old event, at the Foreballs and Foursoms on Saturday.
Instead of playing for the United States more often, he won five majors and spent the day training in the trenches in the hopes that he could solve his own problems.
The 48-year-old, who lacked the accuracy of the ball even during his playing career, is not suited for the tough Le Golf National course, a ground full of thorny grasses that punishes the wrong shots.
Although the golf course is no longer that difficult, Mickelson will face reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth straight game. He has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
Mickelson's game will definitely be decisive if the Americans have a strong start when they play 12 singles matches under four points.
He has shown his confidence in his players and says he can't say anything else.
"He fully understands what the role he will have to play today. He told me that he will be ready tomorrow by hitting me on the outside and encircling me," Furic said.
He has a lot of confidence in him.
He's been a great player and has contributed a lot to the team this season.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it happened.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
A rider's cup that doesn't match the heights of his personal record will mark the end of his career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws. however, his presence has brought to the team many things that could not have been bettered, Furick said.
"He's fun, he's funny, he's fun, he's a great guy to have on the team," Furick said.
I think it was a lot of fun for the young players to play against him this week, and it was a lot of fun to watch.
He'll do more than just play.
The great leader of Europe, Captain Thomas John, will soon be gone.
European captain Thomas John is well aware from experience that even if the unruly lead to the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup is doomed.
Dane made his debut in a match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team captained by Zev Ballesteros scored five points more than the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a very slight margin, winning the lead 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that there's a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at the Brookline, where we lost, we won at Valderama, but it was just a win," John said after watching the class of 2018, where John's team won 5-3 at Le Golf International and 10-6 yesterday.
This is the reason why I and the rest of the team are not finished yet.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Get out of this situation and do the right thing.
Nothing lasts until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal and that is to try to win this trophy, which is our full focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in my team, but we know better who is on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Delighted with his team's performance on the rough golf course, John added: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow's events will be different.
It's great to be on the course with a partner when things are going well, but if you're on the course alone, your potential as a golfer will be fully tested.
That's the message you have to give among the players, that is, bring out the best in you tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to go and get the best out of him."
Unlike his opponent Jim Furyk, who has the opposite attitude, Jim urges players to perform individually rather than as partners, the only exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury has seen both ends of the great sporting event on the Angel of Death on the last day, and Fury, who was part of the team that won at Brookline, was beaten by Europe when he brought out the "Miracle of Medina."
For the final day, when asked how the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, assembled his players, he said, "I remember every bit of it."
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but as seen in Brookline, you want to have a fast start as seen in Medina.
When the speed goes the other way, there can be a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We've set the line-up, we've got the players' style that we think is right for us, and you know, we're trying to take out a bit of magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the responsibility of leading the blow and in the top-match he will face Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I went with this group on this order because I think it covers it all the way," John said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship commission has been postponed again.
The German Navy's latest warship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older and Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, it will not be commissioned until at least next year, local media reported.
A military spokesman was quoted as saying that the commissioning of the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleship, the Rheinland-False, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The Navy was supposed to receive the vessel in 2014 itself, but the fate of the pride project was adversely affected by the problems it faced before delivery.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that these ships will also have some stealth technologies, such as high-powered artillery and air-to-air, ship-to-ship missiles and radar, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that there is no need to carry out long-term repairs, so new warships should be able to be deployed, far from the ports of the mother country, for up to two years.
However, the die seat suggests that the continuous delay in commissioning means that these warships, equipped with advanced technologies, may have expired by the time they enter service, allowing Germany to demonstrate its strength in foreign countries.
The ill-fated F-125s gained media attention last year when the German Navy formally refused to commission the ships and sent them back to Hamburgerhelle Blom and Vose Shipyard.
It was the first time in the Navy's history that the ship was returned to the manufacturer after taking delivery.
No one knows anything about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media reports that the ship has several critical "software and hardware faults" and therefore the battleship would be of no use if deployed for a war mission.
The software flaws are particularly important as the new Baden-Württemberg class ships are controlled by a group of 120 men, who are just half of the sailors on the older Bremen class warships.
Further, it has been reported that the ship is overloaded, which will reduce the ship's load and limit the Navy's ability to innovate in the future.
Reinland-False is believed to weigh 7,000 tons and be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the German car in World War II.
While putting things off due to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - becomes an issue.
It was initially expected to cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, but is now said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 ($3.6 billion).
In light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling, issues affecting the latest warships are of particular importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "deployed ships."
The officials said the problems were compounded by the fact that old ships were decommissioned but not getting new ships for the purpose.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-Württemberg class warships were of any use to the Navy.
The Secret Life of Pets
To understand how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food, a new research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands.
The findings are expected to be useful to gain new knowledge about the behavior of these flying unique mammals and help guide future bat conservation efforts.
At the Inverrewe Gardens in Wester Rose, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will observe the common bats, the soprano pipistrelles bats, and the brown long-eared Doubenton bats.
Special recorders will be set up at key locations around the estate to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will conduct a mobile survey using hand-held detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will help to determine the frequency of bat sounds and to know which bat species produces the sound.
Subsequently, an ecosystem map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the topographical-periphery of bat behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's natural conservation adviser, hopes the survey's results will reveal what areas of the ecosystem are most important to bats and how each of the bat species is used.
For bats and other related species, this information can help determine the benefits of ecosystem maintenance activities, such as the creation of grasslands and the best maintenance of woodlands.
Over the past century, the number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly.
Bats are threatened by the destruction of habitats, development activities, and buildings that affect wetlands.
Wind powered turbines, electric light, fly papers, chemical treatment of construction materials and attacks from pets are threats to bats.
The clouds aren't really dark.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use highly complex echo-location techniques to accurately determine insects and obstructions in the flight path.
The NTS bats, which are in charge of the maintenance of more than 270 historically important buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, are considered very serious.
The institute has ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, conduct nest tests, and sometimes rescue the animals.
The organisation has opened Scotland's first single dedicated bat sanctuary in the Triewa estate in Dumfries, the Galloway, which inhabits eight of the bat species found in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is a perfect model for bats.
"There's a lot of room for trolls here," he said.
"There are a lot of old buildings, a lot of big trees and good habitat.
But there's still a lot of unknowns about bats, so what we're doing here and in other estates will help us understand more about what's needed to make bats mature."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before repairing them inside buildings, because accidentally destroying a single nest can kill 400 female and children, sometimes even exterminating the entire area.
It is illegal to kill, injure, disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferral, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public for help.
They said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t know how many bat species exist and how well their numbers are increasing.”
Ronaldo's lawyers to seek compensation from the magazine for the alleged sexual assault
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and said people using his name "are making a name for themselves."
His lawyers are preparing to move court against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Cristiano Ronaldo is accused of raping an American woman named Kathrin Mayorga, who played for Portugal and Juventus, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Ronaldo allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the matter secret, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video within hours of the allegation being reported, the thirty-three-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
"It's a lie," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a live stream.
They want to use my name.
This is natural.
They want to get fame by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm fine," he added with a shrug.
In relation to the allegations, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a defamation case against Der Spiegel, which lawyers described as "an inadmissible reporting of doubts in the realm of privacy", according to Reuters.
Christian Shertz, the actor's lawyer, said the actor would seek compensation for "moral damages that are as serious as a violation of the law," adding that "in recent times, this is one of the most serious violations of individual rights."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suit at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room after meeting at the nightclub, where Ronaldo allegedly made her feel at ease.
After the alleged incident, Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled in front of her and told her that he was "99 percent a good man" but that he had cheated on her with "one percent."
Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but documents claim that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took photos of the injury at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside of court, saying she agreed to the settlement because she felt "worrying about the retaliation" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said he is still waiting for the court's decision to dismiss the case.
Ronaldo, who left Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, moved to Italian club Juve this summer at a fee of $100 million.
Brexit: UK 'forever sorry' for the loss of carmakers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its status as the world's number one car manufacturer after Brexit.
Toyota said it was "concerned" that the UK had told the BBC it would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a change," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that if there was no deal, it would result in the loss of jobs due to the impact of delays in the country's borders.
Toyota's Auris and Avensis plant produced 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I'm of the opinion that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop manufacturing at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Managing Director in Berneston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work, with regard to Britain's departure from the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says that the Mini plant at Oxford will be closed for a month following the Brick City closure.
In the event of a Brexit without an understanding, the main concerns that car manufacturers say are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line operates based on "time of arrival of components," with components arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a barrier at the border, leading to delays and shortages in parts, the industry said.
The company said it would be impossible to stock up on more than one day's worth of inventory at Toyota's derbyshire plant, so production would have to be halted.
Clarke said Theresa May's checkers' plan for future ties with the EU was "precisely planned to avoid such checks across the border."
“We need an understanding. We want to have a better understanding that not only allows us to enjoy the current success, but allows us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"What we have had is a very high level of successful supply chain, and the evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers reminds us that we definitely need to be able to stay that way."
While Toyota did not say how long the plant would be shut down, the company warned that in the long run, the additional costs could reduce the plant's competitiveness and result in job losses.
Peter Suvallaris, the unit union convener at the plant, who has been working in Berneston for 24 years, said his members were concerned by the increased levels: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein delayed: White House
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “will be delayed by a week” as the feud over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's interference in the justice system.
Whether or not Trump will expel the deputy attorney general, and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been the fuel of Washington rumors for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Despite the news that he was going to retire, he went to the White House last Monday.
Trump is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't want" Rosenstein to be fired, but delayed the meeting to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee trial, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, had to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, delaying the entire Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date set for that, and it is likely to happen this week itself, and I think we can defer it for another week, considering everything else the Supreme Court has."
I'm always interested in learning new things."
Sanders has not held a White House press conference since the 10th of September.
The host, Chris Wallace, wondered why.
Sanders stated that the lack of press conferences was not due to resentment towards the "mass" of TV reporters, although she stated: "I don't disagree with the fact that they're coming together."
She also suggested that the media and Trump would have a direct contact.
“The president handles more Q&A sessions than his predecessors,” she said, adding without evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
"If the media gets a chance to ask the President of the United States directly questions, that's a lot better than talking to me," Sanders said.
You've seen us do it so many times over the last few weeks and now instead of holding a press conference, you're going to talk to the President of the United States directly."
When leaving the White House or attending open sessions, Trump routinely answers questions during press conferences with distinguished people.
It's very rare to find newspapers.
This week in New York, it was revealed why it appeared independently but strangely before the assembled reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary also wrote to EU workers working on the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they continue to do so after Brexit.
Less than six months after the UK left the European Union, the MSP sent a letter to the British government.
The Scottish government has already offered to cover the cost of the status of permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in the field of public services transferred.
In the letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "With the summer, the UK and the EU continue to negotiate compromises on withdrawals, and the expected decisions may be made this autumn.
However, the UK is preparing for a no-deal Brexit.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff irrespective of their citizenship.
The invaluable experience and skills shown by colleagues from many parts of the EU and elsewhere have played a huge role in strengthening and improving the health care system, benefiting patients and society.
"Scottish is your home, and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Kristian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after losing to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"When he came to the sideline, he collapsed," Reid said.
On the sideline, the trainers and the doctors put Abercrombie on a stretcher of oxygen and took him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"There is no information available on the extent or type of the injury," he said, adding that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
It was the first season in the state of Tennessee since Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year graduate, moved out of Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before the end of the game on Saturday, including 18 tackles this season.
Foreigners will have to pay a high stamp duty when they arrive in the UK.
Foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory plans.
The move will neutralise Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
Taxpayers in the UK will have to pay more stamp duty.
The scheme is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - more money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting higher incomes.
In the UK, stamp duty will be levied on individuals and entities who do not pay taxes. The extra money will support the government’s move to provide housing for the homeless.
Surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty imposed two years ago on second homes and tenancy properties - can be up to three per cent.
The goal is to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Outsiders buy 13 per cent of London's newly built properties, making it difficult for first-time buyers to get into the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a good percentage of buyers are foreigners who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of taking possession of land but not using it, and called on Mrs. May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "particular depravity."
Mr. Corbin announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions of "non-conflictants."
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: “I said last year that my position as Prime Minister would be dedicated to restoring the British dream, that is, making life better for every new generation.
This means that we need to fix our housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that non-UK residents and foreign companies can easily buy homes like hardworking British residents.
The dream of having a home of their own for many people is far from over, and one is that the shame of not having a home where you can sleep well remains quite a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to take control of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" at one point was to control Scotland.
The 42-year-old is currently third in the league with the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club.
After leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"As a player, my ambition is to play for my country.
I got a B cap, and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC Scotland’s SportsSound.
"When I was a kid, I grew up watching a lot of Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always held me back.
I'll only win if I can control the game."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland manager included Dick Advakt, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin Onil, Roy Keane, Gus Poit and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic Boss says he has no hesitation in being the successor to established names in such big clubs. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success will now be measured by the question, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
The structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly place it in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but once I can bring this club back, I feel like I've been successful here."
Rose spent only three years of her managerial career in Dumbarton as assistant boss and on Harts' coaching staff for 15 months.
He later helped Alova make her way to the third tier from the defeat, saving St Mirren from the defeat and making her the championship title winner of the next season.
Rose says she feels happier now than she did in her career at Clyde, Heart Lipool, Falkirk, St. Miran and Hamilton Academics.
"It may have been a real turning point," he says, taking on the role of Leova.
"I've always believed that management is better than playing.
It may seem strange, but I've earned the right to live without a problem, to reach a certain height.
But it can be difficult to play.
Every week there is a lot going on.
I still have work-related difficulties and dedications, but management feels very good to me.
I’ve always wanted to be in management, and now I’m here, and I’m happy that I’m doing what I love at my age.”

The best time for a pint is 5.30pm on Saturday.
In the UK, there has been an increase in the number of people who have lost their homes due to severe weather.
Sales in the month of July were up by 2.7 per cent in pub bar groups, while in restaurants it was down by 4.8 per cent.
The figures were compiled by Peter Martin, CGA of a business consultancy, who said: "Continuous summers and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup took place in June and July in pubs.
The restaurant sector, which contracted by 1.8% in June, fell further in July.
Restaurants and bars have been operating at a slower pace than they have been in recent years.
The food was great in the summer, but the food was not good.
Everyone is going out for a drink.
The sales of beverages in bars and pubs across the country increased by 6.6 per cent month-on-month, while food declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, of Lisher and Hospitality Analysts RSM, says: “These results, which were seen in late April, are still coming in.
The most important factors influencing sales in markets are climate and social sporting events.
It's no exaggeration to say that restaurant groups have to worry about this, however, the 4.8 percent year-on-year sales drop is in addition to the continued focus on price.
Food-led operators are likely to have the greatest impact on the long-running summer, and we'll have to wait and see if the mild weather in August can provide temporary relief."
The overall growth of 2.7 per cent experienced in July in the wake of new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors, in fact, indicates a slowdown in brand rollouts.

One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One survey revealed that one in five children - even those as young as 11 - may have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake insta" pages.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of children said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children <0xE2><0x80><0x93> even 11 years old <0xE2><0x80><0x93> make social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "Fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of the students have a clean “main” account and confidential personal accounts to show their parents.
When a mother visited the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, she was stunned to see a teenager in it calling out to others to “rape her.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have 2 profiles, and half of those have secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Bucknan said: “It’s an unpleasant fact that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elid Doyle on the Scottish Athletics Board "That Will Be the Voice for the Ballots"
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most well-known track and field athlete, and Ian Beatty, chairman of the sport’s governing body, said: “It’s a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the vast experience they’ve gained internationally over the past decade.
“Elyde is highly respected in the Scottish, UK, and world athletics community. And we believe that bringing them on board will greatly benefit athletics in Scotland,” Beatty added.
Doyle said: “I am very excited to be working as a voice for athletes and believe that I will be able to contribute and help my own to lead the sport in Scotland.”
An American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, lost his mobility to a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke on the same day a month ago.

Mother's milk-based diet has sparked controversy online.
A video of a mother breastfeeding her baby has gone viral on the internet.
To launch a product titled "the world's first wearable unbrushed breast pump," Consumer Tech Company LV released an interesting music video showcasing a new pump facility for mothers.
It depicts 4 Ammars dancing to this music at a place where straws are laid for cows. The lyrics read: "Yes, I'm milking milk, but you can't see the tail." And "If you don't listen, I'll tell you, it's not the calves, it's my breasts."
He said, "Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, I'm going to cross the milk."
However, the company's Facebook page has been embroiled in controversy.
The video, which has over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from fans, with many commenting on the dairy industry's "connections."
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, produce milk by fertilizing and giving birth to their babies, except when their babies are removed from them within a few days of birth," he said.
The LV breast pump (LV/'mother) can very well be placed inside a nursing bra
Another commented: "It's hard to understand that a mother and a child are the same.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can breastfeed their babies?”
Another added: "It's a no-brainer.
Some people have commented that the song is "interesting."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have done it if I were pregnant now.
When I was growing up, I felt like an animal.
It's a bit of an exaggeration, but I accept it as such.
"It's a good product," he said.
Another commented: "This is an interesting ad aimed at mothers (sometimes in the workplace and toilets) who look like "pumping cows."
This is not a criticism of the food industry."
At the end of the video, the women are seen dancing around the fire.
The idea behind this campaign is that women who pump their breasts feel like cows.
Although the LV pump is definitely convenient, there are no wires or tubes at all. And the nursing bra is properly fixed inside, which gives women the freedom to walk, pick up children and go outside while pumping.
Anna Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, says: “The LV pump is definitely a revolutionary product. It needs a bold and turbulent start.
We have tried to bring to light the difficulties associated with breast-pumping by comparing breast-pumping with breast-feeding mothers and cows. We are showcasing the new pumping freedom in a very interesting and approachable way.
This isn't the first time the LV pump has been in the news.
At the London Fashion Week, the model, who is a mother of two, used this product to make the cat walk for designer Martha Jackbowski
Hundreds of migrant children have been moved to tent camps at Texas Border.
While the number of children crossing the border each month has remained unchanged, there has been a huge increase in the number of children in prohibited immigration, as some of the Trump administration's rough policies make it difficult for sponsors to pick up children.
Many traditional sponsors become undocumented immigrants and risk their lives if they come forward to take on a child's responsibilities.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities, sponsors, and adult members of their household were asked to submit their fingerprints and share the information with the immigration authority.
Matthew Albanese, a top official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the congress that a dozen people had been arrested for sponsoring a miner who had not been with them in the past week.
The agency said about 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"More than 80 per cent of the sponsored persons and their families are illegal immigrants, and a large part of them have criminal backgrounds.
"We're trying to protect them," Mr. White said.
In order to settle the child matter expeditiously, the officers had enacted new rules, according to which they would have to appear before the court within a month of their detention.
More and more people are making conference calls instead of appearing in person in front of an immigration judge for their application for legalization.
Those who do not deserve it should be thrown out of the country immediately.
Depending on the situation in the next few months, as with the comments and reports of Shelter activists, children who are incarcerated most of the time become anxious and depressed. This can lead to worse mood swings and attempts to escape.
The reason for this is that children are more likely to be neglected in large facilities such as Tornillo.
She said that moving children to Tent City without mentally preparing or even giving them the time they need to say goodbye to their friends would only increase the pain they are experiencing.
The United States, France and Turkey are calling for the immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Interior Minister Walid al-Moulam urged Syrian refugees to return home at a time when the country's war is entering its eighth year.
Maulam, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the foreign military presence on Syrian soil is illegal in the name of combating terrorism and that it will "treat them as it should be."
"They need to get back to normal," he said in a statement.
Maulam stressed that the "war on terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is almost over.
He said the holy struggle would continue until "illegal aliens" and "terrorist groups" were eliminated from all Syrian territory.
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria that provide training and advice to Syrian Arabs and Kurdish militias opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops in this war-torn country.
Maula said it was time for them to return to their homelands. He also accused "some Western countries" of spreading "false fears" and keeping refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"It's a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the construction of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, provided an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations, according to UN diplomats.
The Russian-Turkish pact excluded a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region of more than three million people.
Maula stressed that there was an "exact time limit" to the agreement, and hoped that the military offensive would target fighters from the Nusra Front, including jihadists linked to al-Qaeda, "and that they would be wiped out."
United Nations Ambassador Stefan de Mistura said he expected to convene the first meeting of a new committee, which will include members from the ruling and opposition parties, to prepare the country's constitution and conduct elections.
Maulana had put forward the conditions for the government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's function should be only to "review the existing provisions of the Constitution."
Why did Trump win for the second time?
According to that logic, as many liberals expect, Trump may win the 2020 election if the impeachment scandal does not end his administration.
This will undoubtedly be one of the most dramatic endings of the game.

Since 2014, Prime Time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to reach 10.5 on MSNBC and 16 on MSNBC.

Money is flowing out of the hard-fought midterm elections
It's no exaggeration to say that Pennsylvania's 17-year-old cash flow was driven by the redeployment of congressional districts that brought two officers into the race for the same position.
The recently reconstituted Pittsburgh Democratic Representative, Conor Lamb, won a seat in another district in a special election last year.
Lamp competes with another official, Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the 12th district of the former Pennsylvania, which now exceeds the 17th district.
In January, the Supreme Court ruled that the old districts had been unconstitutionally shown to favour Republicans.
The new 17th Congress marked the beginning of an economic battle between the major financial parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamptey became a household name in Pennsylvania when he won a narrow majority in the special election in March, which was widely viewed as the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats have a small chance of winning.
The U.S. is considering imposing fines on China for its support of El Salvador, which it later withdrew.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have supported Beijing, despite considerable discontent from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Trump had a hotel in Panama, but its partners fired Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "in light of recent decisions that Taiwan will no longer be recognized," Department of State spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
The fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in economic benefits and visa restrictions, are expected to distress Central American countries and lead to an increase in unemployment and murder rates.
As domestic meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rescheduled their high-level meetings to review the progress of last year's high-level talks on security and economic prosperity, a step forward in efforts to curb immigration.
High-level officials are calling for the conference to be pushed forward by mid-September, which will also help to consider penalties for El Salvador.
Deputy Prime Minister Mike Pence, who has been assigned to convene the conference, postponed it to mid-October to include top officials in the administration, according to policymakers.
The three U.S. diplomats returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new sanctions or new messages.
Bolton, a White House spokesman, declined to comment on a discussion that began with three US officials who had agreed to talk about the uncertainty of the domestic situation in the United States, including diplomats.
This was followed by a discussion with the outside world, which focused on the uncertainties of the situation.
Study history
The next major event to come is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which may be specific evidence in public records about Trumps unfairness.
Mueller is investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia.
Is it possible that Trump and a jury at that meeting will not be held accountable if Congress takes responsibility as it prepares to go before the voters again?
If Trump and one of his fellow jurors at that meeting takes responsibility as he prepares to go before voters again, it is likely that Congress will not take responsibility.

With Villarreal in season 2-2, midfielder Graham Torrance has not been able to make his debut due to a knee injury, but he believes that the result of the match can do wonders on the springboard for the Rangers.
"It's good for us that Villarreal is in good condition," the 31-year-old said.
“When we go out to play believing we can do something, we come back with the point.
This may be the last time we look at it, but it's worth noting.
We played well in the first half, but we came back better in the second half.
Thursday is a big night.
We can expect to get three points, but this is a difficult game because they have good results from their last games. But I believe with the support of our people, we can do this and we can achieve a positive result.
The past year has been difficult due to my injuries and the changes that have taken place at the club, but now it's been a relief.
The squad is very good and the players enjoy playing and the training is very good.

Women lose sleep over the fear of savings during their retirement.
While many of the survey participants had clear views on how they should be protected, very few had to speak to their family members about it.
Half of the participants in the study said they talked to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10% of people talk about it.
Everyone needs a family member to take care of them, but many are not ready to even talk about it, said Holly Sinder, vice president of the International Life Insurance Business.
This is where we start.
If you don't talk to your partner and children together, you may not be able to give your family the protection they want.
Discuss with your counselor and your family and make sure you know where and what care you’re taking. These decisions are an important factor in how much it will cost.
Bring your financial adviser to the field: Your counselor will be able to give you advice on how to meet these expenses.
For this, you can opt for a policy that ensures traditional long-term protection in your interests to raise money, or a hybrid cash value life insurance policy that covers such costs, or self-insured from your own savings - as long as you have the money.
Find a solution to your financial problems: Win legal battles.
Hire a person to take care of your health. You can hire a trusted person to take care of your health and make sure that the professionals are working according to your wishes, even if you are probably unable to communicate.
Find a successor for your property.
When you are unable to do so, you can entrust the most trusted person to make financial decisions for you and pay your bills.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding the death toll could rise.
Rescue officials said they had no information about the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, as communication lines were blocked in Donggula Regency in northern Palu, close to the center.
More than 16,000 people were displaced as a result of the earthquake.
Here are a few facts about the provinces of Palu and Dongla in the island of Sulawesi.
Palu Sulawesi, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, is a very narrow strait on the west coast of the island. Its estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Tonggala Regency is located 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi on the island of Sulawesi.
This regency is an administrative region below a province, with a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal town of Tonggalla.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated on Morovali, the opposite coast of the Sylvais.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, there have been multiple tsunamis in Palu and Tonga over the past 100 years.
The 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Tonggalla.
In 1996, a tsunami in the western province of Tonga killed nine people.
Geographically, Indonesia, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, is frequently prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important recent earthquakes and tsunamis
2004: A major earthquake hits 14 countries off the coast of the Indian Ocean on December 26 in Indonesia's Aik province, North Sumatra, killing 226,000 people, more than half of whom were in the Aik.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coasts of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on Indonesia's most populous island of Java caused a tsunami that devastated the entire southern coast and killed more than 700 people.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in the city of Patang, the capital of North Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake in the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra in 2010 caused tsunami waves up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing more than 300 people.
A minor earthquake in the PD Regency in the province of Aiken in 2016 caused much damage, prompting panic among people, especially after the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
But this time, it wasn't because of the tsunami, but because of me, more than 100 people were trapped under the collapsed buildings.
In 2018, a massive earthquake struck Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly from the island's north.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Pal, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
In Saturday’s report, Alaska State Troopers reported that Pauline, 29, who lives in Alaska’s Wasilla, was arrested for domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he had also seized the phone from the woman who tried to inform the police about the alleged offences.
According to a report by KTUU, Paul was taken on an unsecured bond of $500 and remanded to other-supatrial facility.
He appeared in court on Saturday and said he was "not guilty" when asked to apologise.
Pal faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, including a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He was charged with Class B, and was sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time a criminal charge has been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was arrested for allegedly harassing his father Todd Pal.
The incident was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is pending in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
He and his girlfriend had been stabbed in the face.
In 2016, Veterans Group had criticised Sarah Paul for allegedly blocking her son's services in the PSTD.
Indonesia earthquake: Death toll mounts to 100
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The death toll is expected to rise in the coming days as the power transmission networks are down.
The earthquake was felt in central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident have gone viral on social media.
As the tsunami approached the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the shores of the city for a beach festival.
Federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty to be handed to the suspect in the NYC terror attack.
New York City prosecutors have called for the death penalty for Saifullah Zaypov, accused of the NYC terror attack that killed eight people, the rarest federal crimes since 1953 that have ever been committed in the state.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a home depot rental truck to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the way.
According to the Southern District of New York's cause of death notice, lawyers have to prove that Zypov "intentionally" executed all eight men and that they "knowingly" caused serious bodily injury.
Both of these charges are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Sipo with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of abetment to robbery, which federal prosecutors have used for ordinary organized crime, and charged with assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.
Lawyers said the manner in which the crime was committed was "harmful, cruel and depraved" and that such an attack required "substantial planning."

Five of the victims were Argentines.
A decade later, the Southern District of New York is facing the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was convicted in the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009 it was commuted to life imprisonment.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death in a New York federal case for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were electrocuted to death on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any remorse even days and months after the attack.
He told police he was happy with his job.
Saipov told authorities that the attack was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also told them to hoist the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
Federal defense counsel David Patton, who appeared for Saipov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to commute the death penalty to life imprisonment without any possibility of being released from jail will only add to the psychological impact of all those involved.
Saipov's defense had already appealed to his lawyers not to seek the death penalty.

Nigel Farage had vowed to "straighten up the People's Army" during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Yukip leader noted that politicians should "know the heat" from the Euros - one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be put in charge of negotiations with Europe.
Peter Bourne, the de facto backbencher in Birmingham, said in March that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have already been 'out'.
The Tories underscored May's challenges in aligning her divided ranks by joining a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to protect his cheeks and compromise plan from attacks by Brexiters, renegades and the European Union.
The Allies argued that they would go ahead and make a deal with Brussels regardless of the direct setbacks - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their promise and the 'difficulties'.
Bourne said he wanted to "expel the chickens" at the Lewes Leaves rally in Solihull.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made an equal stakeholder and given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I support Brexit, but we need to get the cheese out."
Speaking to the BBC, he said: "We are not against the war.
We want to make our own rules in our own country.”
Bonn rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 poll. The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to continue is completely untrue.
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins also attended the march, and she told reporters: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The jokers are not so well known in the public, and the opposition is not going to vote for them.
Please stop by and take a look at the trailers.
In her message to Miss May, she added: “The Prime Minister can only hold his office until he keeps his promises.
Farage said that if you want to avoid the decision taken in the 2016 plebiscite, politicians at the rally should be encouraged to "heat up."
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our ruling class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit but we're here today to tell them - we're not going to let you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to 'heat up' our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country, which has given us victory in Brick City, and we will never rest until we become independent, autonomous and a United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the reminderers had marched to Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Over the weekend after the group's launch, Tories' little-known credentials were skewed against the Brexit banners.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party began the conference by mocking the security issues faced by the Conservatives' party app.
These people are telling us that the IT systems are right, that we have all the technology for Canada Plus, the friction-free borders, and the unrestricted free market in Ireland.
This is a farce
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to closely monitor the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully analyze her run for president after the November election.
On Saturday, the Mossachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Mossachusett sex, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running against GOP state representative Geoff DeHail in a November re-election. DeHale was co-chair of Trump's Mossachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is some debate as to whether Trump will run for president in 2020.
After coming to power, the 36th meeting of the Town Hall format was held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon.
One of the participants asked if they were running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to mend their broken regime.
Arrested in the shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was announced at the 11 a.m. ET news conference by the Baton Rouge Police Department
The man in the video has been identified and he released video footage of Friday night's shooting.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the University of Southern California campus on Friday morning
“Wayne Sims had a bullet wound to the head, resulting in his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters via 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade went to his friend's defense and shot Simpson.
Simpson, who was having the weapon in his hand, was interrogated and admitted that he was present at the spot and Wade Simpson was shot.
Simpson was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department without a warrant.
The 6-foot-6-inch junior Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, including 10 starters, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2,9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ended the world title after handing over the team mandate to beat Sebastian Vettel.
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in a match in which Mercedes’ team orders would play a big role.
Botswana had a good start at the pole, and in defense of his position in the first two turns, invited home to attack fellow members of the team, which left Hamilton in a bad mood.
It was crucial for the home to go to Pitts first and allow the vallet to run Hamilton in traffic.
Mercedes followed home by catching a lap, but Hamilton went ahead with the wheel-to-wheel action, cutting off the Ferrari driver, who was reluctant to hold on after a double-double to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his twenty-first birthday.
He then held on to the tyres for a quick finish, trailing Kimi Raikkonen by a large portion of the race to fourth place.
He finally reached Pitts on the 44th lap and reached Raikon 4th as he was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps.
"It was a difficult day because Walter did so well and was a gentleman who told me to let him go.
"The team did a great job," Hamilton said.
It was definitely body language.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's claim that the Supreme Court had not leaked a letter written by Christie Blaise Ford alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Nominee Brett Kabanok.
While President Ford did not directly address the letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee at a rally in West Virginia, he said what was going on in the Senate showed people how selfish, untrustworthy and bad-tempered they are.
"The most beautiful things that are happening right now in the Senate are the possibility of happening when you see angry, selfish, bad-tempered and disloyal people," he said.
When the news gets bad, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Dion Feinstein, did you steal?
You remember their answer <0xE2><0x80><0x93> you leaked the document <0xE2><0x80><0x93> “Oh, oh, what?”
Oh, no.
I didn't cheat."
Oh, wait a minute.
We didn't leak, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator's face.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the allegations made by Ford against Cavanaugh, and it was leaked in the first days of September - but Feinstein denied it had been leaked from his office.
"I didn't try to hide Dr. Ford's allegations, and I didn't let their story out," Feinstein told a committee.
They asked me to keep it a secret, so I did.
But their protest didn't feel so good to the president, and at Saturday night's rally, he said, "Let me tell you, it's bad body language.
They may not have done it, but they showed a body language like they had never seen it before."
The president said that while the Supreme Court defended the nominee, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, Democrats may still be making allegations from their side.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
"You can see their selfishness and bad behavior, and it doesn't matter who they're hurting or who they want to run after to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Doerr scored two goals for the Giants.
Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Staines on Friday in a 5-3 win over the Elite League in Dundley on Saturday.
Jaynes had already taken a two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Doerr and Francis Belluer.
Mike Sullivan and John Crownee were bringing the home side in before the Giants' lead Dyer was restored.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Butchard scored for Tendy before Lucas Lenduard Nelson scored the goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Kiffi's men in a back-to-back 2-1 win over Dundy in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides.
With the help of Kendall McFall in the 4th minute at 3.35, Doyer's opener came in and four minutes later David Rutherford doubled the lead with the help of Belvedere.
After a busy opening time, Sullivan returned home on 13-10 before being given the equaliser by Matt McCartney at 15:16.
At the end of the first half, the Giants took the lead by scoring their second goal of the night before taking the first break.
The home side reorganized the group and Bouchard once again placed them in the level teams with a powerplay goal of 27-37.
At the end of the second period, Crowne and Charles Coren helped Neilson to take the lead for Dundy for the first time in the match and ensured his team's victory in the fifth half of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will return to Milton Keynes on Friday for their next match.
An air traffic controller has died while trying to avoid a plane with 100 people on board.
The air traffic controller, who died in Indonesia, became famous after his death as the plane carrying hundreds of people made a safe landing.
A massive earthquake in the island of Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people and caused a tsunami.
Heavy rains are continuing to affect the area, with many of the city's residents still trapped in the rubble.
While many of his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Giunavan Agung, who fled from the control tower at the Palau airport, was not ready to give up his job.
At the same time, he remained in the office to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, flew safely.
He then realized that the control tower had collapsed and he was going to jump from there.
He later died at the hospital.
"Indonesia's air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said: ""His decision may have saved hundreds of lives."
We had arranged for a helicopter to take him to another big city hospital from Balikpan in Kalimentun.
But we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is very sad news," he added.
According to a statement by the country's disaster mitigation agency, the death toll in Dongla, CG and Boutong is likely to rise to thousands as access to the city is limited.
The agency's spokesman, Syutopo Parvo Nagrao, said the death toll was likely to rise as many could not reach them and many bodies were still under the rubble.
The storm, which was more than six feet high, led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military industrial aircraft are delivering services and goods.
"The bodies are being transported in an ambulance every minute," Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News
Clean water is very scarce.
"Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has arrived at the scene looking for survivors, but we don't know what they can see there.
This is a big problem, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the country on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "You must complete all the tasks related to evacuating people day and night."
"Are you ready?" he said to CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed 550 people.
Air New Guinea reports that one person has gone missing after the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which flies the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing and that the crew of 47 passengers had been safely evacuated from the crashed plane.
In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Air New Guinea said it could not find a male passenger.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond to requests for more information, such as the age and citizenship of the missing person.
Local boats arrived to help the passengers and crew of the plane that crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuck Island airport.
According to officials, seven people were admitted to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six people were in the hospital and all were out of danger.
It is not yet clear what caused the crash and how it happened.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before reaching the runway at Laguna.
Some eyewitnesses said the plane appeared to have crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jains said the plane was too low to land.
"It's really good," Jensen said.
Jones said she and her crew were forced to walk through the water to exit the emergency exit.
He stated that the flight attendants were frightened and shouted and he sustained minor injuries on his head.
The US Navy said the sailors involved in refurbishing a sea bridge nearby helped rescue people using a wind-filled boat, which landed the plane in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air New Guinea's aviation safety network says 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the past two decades, but none of them were from Air New Guinea.
Timeline of a woman's death at night.
On Saturday, the prosecution once again considered the argument of the accused in the case of the burning alive of a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the investigation.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone records to put together details about the exact night's movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old deceased Jessica Chambers.
Contrary to his earlier assertions, Clarion Ledger reported that he learned that he was present with the Teles Chambers on the evening of the day of the incident with location information collected from several cellphones.
When the defendant claimed he was in the vicinity of his friend Michael Sanford, the information he had collected from the cell phone indicated he was near Chambers, police said, speaking to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford admitted that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by a lawyer if it was true that Teles had said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied: "It's a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
According to Teles, they had known each other for two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records indicate they had only known each other for a week.
After Chamberss’ death, he removed the Telechasers messages, calls and contact information from his phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of my life," she said.
The final debate is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the verdict to be delivered the same day.
The Hybrid: What Is Conscious Hip Hop? »
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative aspects of the art form with positive messages in their music.
According to The Hybrid, hip-hop has moved away from the kind of sensibilities that highlight political messages and social issues.
They want to bring hiphop back to its roots and re-promote the Confucius hip hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have recently undergone a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black man?!
New York filed a lawsuit against the couple for the "anti-racism" message.
A New York-based couple have been charged with racial abuse after they received a message from their mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied the allegations and said the case was one of looting.
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when Giselle Maurice, who came to take care of her child, found out she was a black woman on her first day at work in 2016.
"No, she's a black woman again," Linsey Plasco-Flaxman said in a message sent to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, they sent it to Maurice twice.
The New York Post reported that when Amalie learned that the "disturbed" Place Co Flexman was an African American who had preceded her, she told Maurice that she had worked very poorly and that she intended to be a Filipino.
Maurice was paid a day's wages and left home in an Uber.
A lawsuit has been filed against Maurice and his wife, who have been offered a six-month payout of $350 a day, which is said to be a pre-determined salary, but has no contracts.
"I'm going to let them know they can't do this." She said in a post on Friday, adding, "I understand it's discriminatory."
The couple objected to the claim that they were racist. They said they had no choice but to quit because they couldn't trust them after verbally abusing them.
"My wife sent me a message that she didn't want to say.
But they are not anti-Semitic.
"We're not racists," her husband, Joel Placeco, told the Post.
"But if you're wrong, would you be willing to hand over your children to someone who's been cruel to you?"
Your newborn baby?
Not at all.
Describing the case as a "robbery," Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months earlier and that she was "in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to follow someone like that?
"I don't think that's a good thing," he added.
Although the legal case is still going on, the verdict soon made the couple's social media profile public, defaming their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not agree with the book The Bear.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jenk, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote in the letter: “Before it was published, it was very difficult to put ourselves in the position of someone who read it for the first time.
It's interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book, was confident even when it was rejected, inspired by a small doll. She added that the 60th anniversary of her death was "poor and sweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of the family" and added that her father was very proud of her success.
"He was very quiet and didn't want to leave," she said.
Paddington was a reality for him, as if you had a brilliant kid, and we'd be proud of what you've done.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
If it was his creation and imagination, he would have given his credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
With her daughter descending, they rushed to the Nice Hospital Louis Pastor 2, and the doctors made an unrelenting effort to save her life.
“She would also be called Nad to say she was in a worse condition than the fire, and she didn’t expect to survive,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperos.
"Then I got a call from Nad, I told her she was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
I did the same.
I said, "Tasha, I love you so much.
I will come to you soon.
Ill be with you.
The medicine that was given to her by the doctors to pump her heart was slowly disappearing from her body and was leaving her body.
She died shortly before it was over.
I had to wait to see it all.
I couldn't cry or scream, I had my family and others around me.
It was very hard for me to hold it all in.
Mrs Edn<0xC3><0xA8>ne-Laperos, who was mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the flight with other passengers.
"Nobody knows," they said.
“I had my head down, tears were pouring through my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to describe, but it's the same feeling I had when I was in the Air Force.
He needed my love and care.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards are used by women to prevent suicides.
Two women who lost their loved ones are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are among the people who receive postcards, including inspirational messages and the phone number of people who need to call for help.
David's son, Tyler, had been depressed since the age of 13 and had committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I wish that no one would ever have to go through the same thing as I did."
Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lidney, recalls that his son was a grown-up chef and owned a smile that attracted everyone.
"He was known by his name among all.
He always said that his smile was the light of his life.
Before he died, he left his job because he was "in a very dark place."
Taylor's brother, who was only 11 years old at the time, committed suicide in 2014.
Ms Davis said: “I’ve always been concerned about the outcome of evolution.”
Miss Davis created the cards, "To let people know that you have a lot of people around you, including friends, who you can reach out to for help and talk to."
Shut up, you need to talk.
A friend of Miss Davis's for many years, Miss Humphreys lost her partner, Mark, at the age of 15, shortly after his mother's death.
“He never said he felt sad, depressed, or anything else,” they said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his behavior had changed.
On Christmas Day, when the children were untying the same things, he didn't look at them or say anything to them.
They said his death was a big tragedy for them, but they could have endured it. "It created a big gap in the family.
We were all stumped.
We have to fight and move on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I felt that if we had got what he wanted - an investigation with deadlines, an investigation with limits - we could have brought about some unity," Mr. Fleicke said on Saturday, adding that the committee "feared" a partisan crusade.
Why don't you want the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh and his Republican aides?
It's time to satisfy them.
With just five weeks to go for the mid-term elections on November 6, if Republicans don't win as well as they'd hoped, their efforts to bring them to the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called to the Senate and lent a helping hand to Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and met with Bush, his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What will happen to the FBI?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but Vice President Mike Pence could end the partnership and be confirmed by the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, North Korea's number of defectors is declining
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, there has been a decline in the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byong-seung, quoting data from the South Unification Ministry, said the number of furloughed workers was 1,127 last year, up from 2,076 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates for smugglers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
Most defectors from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship over time.
Seoul says about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have crossed through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the DMZ (Defence-free Zone) between the two Koreas.
China sees these refugees as illegal immigrants, who are often forced to return to their home countries.
Relations between the North and the South <0xE2><0x80><0x93> though still virtually at war <0xE2><0x80><0x93> have improved significantly in recent months
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for stalled talks on denuclearization.
This comes after a historic summit in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in June in which they decided to jointly work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday criticised the U.S. sanctions.
"Without trust of any kind in the US, there is no certainty in our international security. So it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says that Brett Kavanaugh is "unmade" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unmadi" and said she was "unfit" to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think, if a woman spoke like that now, she would have called herself 'Manmade'," Pelosi said in response to Cavanogg's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emphatically denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Talking about the family and the high school period, he was at times very emotional and kept raising his voice and coughing.
Cavanaugh bluntly blamed Democrats on the committee, calling it a "ridiculous and coordinated homicide" organized by outraged liberals over the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi noted that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, as she said he was showing an anti-democratic attitude.
"I think such statements, and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats, disqualify him," she said.
Pelosi expressed disappointment when asked if she would be impeached if she cemented Kavanaugh's position and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I'm saying is -- if he's not willing to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, and not the position he is in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about how the Cavanaugh policies would look against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, especially when he is considered an orthodox jurist.
In his confirmation arguments, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether some of the Supreme Court decisions could be overruled.
“This is not the time for a mad, easily influential person to go to court and say, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>That’s great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It's a juicy abuse, an intense anger that's gone on for months and years, but they can't show it without crying.
45 years ago, Miss Staine told me, "We cry when we're angry."
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “A woman who was an executive at a place helped me a lot. She used to say that when she was angry she cried too, and when she was angry she developed a habit of crying. She used to say to the person she was talking to, “You might think I was crying because I was sad.
I am furious."
Then they continued on.
I think it was a very wise decision."
Tears of anger can also be allowed, but they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One thing I remember from my previous job was that I was crying one day in an office full of male staff because of the anger I couldn't express - when an older woman, a manager I'd always seen, grabbed me by the scarf around my neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're so sad that they'll only be happy to have you as their heir.
Petraeus Schoeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Garrihart in his race to become president.
In 1987, when Hart was booted out of Monkey Business and kept out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder was so disappointed that she thought there was no reason not to run for president.
"It wasn't a big decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates at the time, and they never wanted another one.
It was called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was so long, they were behind in raising money, so they vowed not to compete until they raised $2 million.
It was a losing war.
Some of her supporters gave $1,000 to the men, while she only gave $250 to them.
She asked, "Do you think they'll take advantage of me?"
She was very emotional when she stated that she was not doing an official campaign - thanking those who supported her, anger at the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of on representatives - all of which suffocated her.
"Everybody thought I was tired of the nervousness," Schroeder said of the media's reaction to him.
"You may have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
“I remember thinking, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>What are they going to put in my grave?
“Is she crying?”
How will the US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
When the US and China hear the ramifications of a trade war and the war is not over, the rift between the two countries will be beneficial for Beijing, he said.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most important event of the week was the new price data on goods worth about $200 million, including virtually half of all goods coming from China to the U.S.
Beijing retaliated in the same coin every time, recently raising tariffs by 5 to 10 percent on 60 million American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., and the world's second largest economy is not going to suddenly lose its luster.
"Resisting Washington means yielding to commitments, but publicly bowing before the US is shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping
But experts say that if Beijing can do things right, the US trade war pressures will reduce interdependence between the two economies and in the long run will be in China's favour.
Abigail Grease, a research associate specializing in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said: "If a political decision taken suddenly in Washington or Beijing causes an economic collapse in either of the two countries, the outcome is likely to be more dangerous than observers have concluded."
Syria's interior minister says the refugees are "ready to return."
The Syrian government says it is ready to return refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the seven-year-old war-torn country.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said the country's facilities are improving
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has been trying to normalize and rehabilitate the areas that have been destroyed by the militants.
We now have all the necessary facilities for the return of refugees. Terrorism and unilateral economic policies would have affected their daily lives and forced them to leave the country.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
"The Syrian government will continue to provide all possible assistance to rebuild the devastated country,"" al-Moulam said"
He stressed that he would not accept any kind of help from countries that have tried to incite riots, or from others on conditional terms.
Rider's Cup win in Paris
Team USA defeated Team Europe 2018 to win the Ryder Cup. The team won the final score of 10.5 <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 16.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
It was the U.S.'s sixth consecutive defeat on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Under the captaincy of Danish captain Thomas Jorn, Europe won the tournament again, scoring 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has struggled for most of the tournament, put his tee shot in the 16th hole of the par-3, defeating Francesco Molinari in the match.
Italian golfer Molinari Terra was one of the four players to score 5-0 in the tournament, which began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to Denmark's Thorb John Olympus, the lowest-ranked player in the European team, on 5&4
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter in the final of his career.
Played in eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the all-time winners of the tournament with 25.5 points
"I'm not a person who cries all of a sudden, but this time I couldn't control myself.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you for choosing to trust me.
I'm glad to have the coffee back.
Everything is teamwork and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said of the European victory.
He handed the lamp to fellow golfer John Raham, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2 & 1 on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods and I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Raham.
Tiger Woods has lost all four games in France and now holds the record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
With 14 major titles - only Jack Nicholls won more than that - he was one of the best players of all time, and his tactics were strange.
The team was struggling throughout the USA over the weekend, excluding Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who had been outstanding throughout the tournament.
"I'm proud of them, they fought," U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing game.
There was a time when we were putting pressure on Europe.
But we were devastated.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of them played well.
We'll regroup, we'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward."
I love these guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You deserve to be congratulated.
We're just playing better than we are."
