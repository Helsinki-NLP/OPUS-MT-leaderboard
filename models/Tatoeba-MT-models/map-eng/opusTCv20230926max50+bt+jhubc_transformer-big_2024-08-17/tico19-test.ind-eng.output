Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in European Union/Economic Region countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that, although the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should increase its readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients who will require health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80<0x25> of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, namely a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospitalization, while another 6<0x25> experience a critical illness that requires intensive care.
Mortality of patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced a further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on WHO case definitions.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA and Great Britain (UK) countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with the date included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified by each country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 a.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14-day layoffs, so taking into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK countries, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present a cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. compared to Italian cases during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK
The 14-day cumulative incident trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar cumulative incidence trend (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 signal that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This was in spite of the difference in stages that countries experienced, the variation in public health response, and the possible difference in case definition between countries and the difference in protocol to choose patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which included follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10<0x25> of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case acceptance data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are only available for 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> of cases respectively (data are not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to supplement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the death toll.
The study, conducted in 2010-2011, showed large variations in the availability of intensive care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of health care capacity, with an estimated prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases for every EU/EEA and UK country associated with risk <0x3E>90<0x25> beyond intensive care bed capacity, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Because so far cases are categorized in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Regional Unit Naming level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As shown in the ECDC’s recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is crucial to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the containment approach to the mitigation approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt to the correct response if that is not the case.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as the country has the possibility to further increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA state health care systems will likely face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and more prevalent in the elderly than younger people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing subject of research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps understand and eradicate this menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who are ordered to stay at home during the holidays and a few weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients repatriated and 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warned that COVID-19 is the “enemy of the No. 1 audience” and has the potential to damage more strongly than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established the sequence of the virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in this fast-growing new subject area.
As much as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far regarding disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
Traditionally, CoV is considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15<0x25> of colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic CoVs for humans twice, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which caused outbreaks that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with dire morbidity and mortality.
Because of this, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections of health care providers were reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, a region quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market were considered to be the initial sites of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
As the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still has to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the following epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected people are over 50 years old, few are under 20 years old, and only 14 are infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction figures (R0) are 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05) and a custom R0 of 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases was 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>) and customised mortality for all patients was 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large, enveloped viral subfamily containing single strands of RNA sense.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bulges or spike (S) envelopes bind to their cell receptors, angiotensin-exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by a cover glycoprotein and a nucleocapsid protein forming a vesicle containing a virion, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> of the 10 samples sequenced; the samples were taken from the site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin part of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to human ACE2 is weaker than its binding to S SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that is not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded with orf3b and a protein secreted with orf8 password.
The orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, arranged forming a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and intermediaries
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96<0x25> identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as virus carriers from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the pangolin, a long-necked mammal eating ant often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of the genetic homology on CoV found in pangolin and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, 1<0x25> of the differences spread throughout the genome are still major differences; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have yet to be obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75<0x25>, disinfectants containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivate the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system via a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes the C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon type I (IFN) synthesis which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses joined the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell function by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, failure of compound organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by the onset cluster, is more about the elderly with the disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, showed that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days was based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent the infected person, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to the virus or are infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early COVID-19 symptom, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, lameness, headache, sore throat, rinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the development of the patient's disease progresses rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Comparatively, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with a higher level of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throat (13-25<0x25>) are shown as main symptoms and ventilation support is required for about 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was at 2<0x25> with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Comparatively, SARS mortality in November 2002 accounted for 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37<0x25> of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95<0x25> confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Because of this, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Classy chants are often found in a family or from a group or vehicle such as a yacht.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacting an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients repatriated from the hospital can carry the virus again. This raises awareness to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, the patient has normal or decreased count of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and the rate of blood deposits increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. fibrin breakdown products in the blood, and lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
Photos of thorax were found in large numbers of COVID-19 patients and were characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunctions lower surfactant levels and increase surface pressure thereby decreasing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Because of this, the worst findings on thorax photos are often parallel to the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as many nucleated syncitial cells in the lungs of patients who died of this disease, in accordance with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only rely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of a history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input instrument) using a dip stick without a single timer.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current therapies and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of compound organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the handling of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include T cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine 4 signal suppression; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended to be given with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, an analog of nucleotides, was found to be beneficial in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and the creation of antibodies
There is a long history of blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, cured patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, several plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or conducts effective antibody filtering against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of the various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, since effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top recovery rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87<0x25> of its patients, which included Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>), and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which used TCM only in about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13<0x25>).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom progression (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> compared to 46.2<0x25>) and mortality was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> compared to 39<0x25>).
Nevertheless, TCM’s efficacy and safety are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and at more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combinations, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 are very fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even susicillity were ever reported.
Tracking contact history and mandatory quarantines, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from the reservoir of infected animals and humans to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the appearance of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which in the long run and effectively makes antibodies neutralizing and/or protective against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the efficacy in vivo of the vaccine candidate in the elderly and the model of the latent challenge and its protection against zoonotic viral infections must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without a sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a model of disease prognosis is very important for the health care body to prioritize its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred at the age of 30-65 years with 47.7<0x25> of patients over the age of 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care tended to have comorbidity and complications and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which signaled age as a prognostic factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Heart events are also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to also be able to bind to colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional marker for heart and liver dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Photos of thorax and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are an immunosuppressant that is widely used as a supportive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered tremendous stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the initial phase.
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, major efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of cutting off the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
Most optimistic estimates say the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model for predicting the final outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conca swab and throat of patients who had recovered and returned home from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicated that the re-identified virus could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs are in place in China, when seen based on declining numbers of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases with half also deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
It may also be that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the feces, giving rise to the possibility of new transmission, namely feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, particularly health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with an infected patient or person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep the saliva splash of potentially infected people out of the air or attached to the surface of the material, where the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (the 1860s series number) can protect against inhalation of virions of as little as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions being able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate even five stacked surgical masks into one, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (the 1860s serial number) instead of a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear translucent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to keep a distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low transmission properties and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and prevention and containment of the disease is not an issue.
This message has calmed people’s fears, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, so that this critical time is too late to stem Wuhan’s small-scale disease.
The disease control agency in China should take lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) more restrictive to stem the potential of an epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often to issue targeted and effective exercise to raise public awareness of the disease.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread across China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gave the impression that the SARS outbreak was repeated again.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to stemming the epidemic and handling patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than young people and more about men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91<0x25> compared to 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA asai to check for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can give positive results again to the virus examination.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues are still to be resolved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology was found to be 96<0x25> between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoV bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from bats.
What animal is an intermediate species to transmit the virus from the host of origin, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off transmission and the outbreak can re-spread at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and result in further pathological changes?
Does this virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How do viruses develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, end like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take some time to find them.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as colds.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how HCoV infection can be very damaging and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, viruses are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir mother of several HCoVs has also been known.
Animal host identification has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Research into CoV-mother interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of the current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted those HCoVs from the point of view of genome evolution and recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of successful host transitions and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) comes from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positively charged, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes bulges or spikes (S), sheaths or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are a source of genes mostly alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while poultry is a major reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organ.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in history today, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), further called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is off and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, mice, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs adapt well and are nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The zoonotic origin tracking of HCoV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and limiting factors in the occurrence of migration between species.
The study can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries, and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we give an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that HCoV parent viruses are usually nonpathogenic in their natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after transmission between species to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
Animal coVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the snot of cold-affected patients, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the upper respiratory tract in 1966, which was further adapted to grow in the WI-38 pulmonary cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of colds, which include headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and coughs seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential series pathways in the still-feeding brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild colds.
Few patients with weakened immune systems show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atipis pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first cases of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-communicator, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and chills, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinases are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30<0x25> of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be deadly, particularly in patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, the elderly, and weakly immune patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Descriptions of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the same viral isolation from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and peaks occur in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crutches.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four community HCoVs have all adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases come from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30<0x25> of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with high case deaths, at 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the scariest viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections and caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a rough case death rate of 3.4<0x25>.
It should be noted, case deaths in Hubei, China, were at 4.2<0x25>, while case deaths outside Hubei were at 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high homology of nucleotide sequences, at 82<0x25>, they both group into different branches of phylogenetic trees.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of mild or even nonspecific symptoms without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, similar to both community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 are at least as high as community HCoV.
On the other hand, declining transmission capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like any other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a fecal sample.
"Whether fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it remains to be clarified by subsequent studies."
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability of transmission, pathogenicity, and continued spread in several pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Viewed from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been species survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes severe illness in humans and people with severe HCoV disease, has been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulate in the human population and trigger a cold in immunocompetent people.
The virus does not require animal reservoirs.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
Both must defend themselves and perform breeding in zoonotic reservoirs as well as find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar picture to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is as easily transmitted as the HCoV community, at least today.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of an evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCoV amplifier.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have a closely related ancestor and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV sustainably and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate mother can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and serve as an amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have a dead end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that animal sellers had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Moonworms (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs on the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all the weasels in the market were killed.
Even so, it was reported that lunar weasels from the wild or livestock that were not exposed to the live animal market gave mostly negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that lunar weasels may only act as an intermediary amplifier host, but not a natural resorvoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80<0x25> of the various animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammalian species also serve as an intermediary amplification host of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
A search of natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV subsequently revealed a closely related bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
This bat gave a positive test result for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and HKU3's SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome sequence.
These and other bat coVs share the homology of 88-92<0x25> nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts for the newly emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, could be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of bat feces was shown to use ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors to enter cells.
Interestingly, the serum of convalescent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor closest to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95<0x25>.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
Bat coV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a viral entry pathway.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arabian camels give seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, much like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to viruses found in humans are isolated from the nasal swabs of Arab camels. This indicates further that the camel is an actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with symptoms that are usually mildly observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted, the infected camel sheds the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, questions remain unanswered as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly as a result of human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> of nucleotide homology with the RATG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found later on.
It is likely that the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals were among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 were related to this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of small, endangered mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90<0x25> at the nucleotide sequence rate.
Both are grouped into two sub-line-derived SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in phylogenetic trees, one sharing a receptor-binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4<0x25>.
Significantly, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the homology sequence of the entire genome is higher.
Previous studies in sick pangolins also reported detection of contig virus from lung samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methods of preparation and manual curation to produce partial genome sequences consisting of approximately 86.3<0x25> complete viral genomes.
We cannot rule out the possibility of a pangolin as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from pangolins due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the relative beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals is still to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genome.
Too speculated if it was said that the high level of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 was driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity was mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination occurs heavily among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a three-color North American bat showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which were detected in Ghana, with Camelidae thought to be also the intermediate host.
To be more clear, current knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of transmission between HCoV species in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species from livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may come into contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoV bats that are related to HCoV-229E exist as diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while the bat's alpha-CoV serves as a burrow of the HCoV-229E gene, Arabic alpacas and camels may serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in the early identification of the virus and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich burrow of virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long lifespans, closely arranged colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability, are all favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal ‘virus spreader’.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurred by chance and humans remained the final host for MERS-CoV because the transmission could not be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
The pangolin may be the final host for beta-CoV relatives of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, the bat could have been a reservoir host for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could have been one of the intermediate amplification hosts for the newly incoming SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody survey of pets and wild animals needs to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation may occur in third species that contact both bats and pangolins.
The search for the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 animal is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors on the virus side are also important for making it easier for CoVs to cross the species barrier.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new host.
CoV has exoribonuclease correction, removal which results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogues are known to suppress CoV replication through this exoribunuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its host mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is actually lower, signaling a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted to the Arabian camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoVs provide extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique "select-copy" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand transitions often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can undergo recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-mother interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus' interaction with the host receptor is another major factor that affects transmission between species.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the incidence of interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and weasel SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively the host antibody response target.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its corrector as a viral entry pathway.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of a variety of animals, which include bats, weasels, mice, and raccoons, thus enabling transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human viral isolates and ferns in RBD and 4 of them were located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The weasel SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of bulge protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be essential for the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding affinity and SARS-CoV-2 S protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
What is also important to know is whether there are other correceptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-terasetylated for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependencies and restriction factors.
This difference in host protein between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier for transmission between species.
HCoV must take over the host dependency factor and break down the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in the field of this important virus-mother interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide filtration to look at the dependency factors and host restrictions of SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV serves as a burrow of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoder gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated bat virus-SARS-CoV was found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation supporting the host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant regions identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between different lineages were shown to take place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV is recombined with other animal CoVs in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in involuntary changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the pressure of selection experienced, such as by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka shows a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a shift in the skeleton.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by selection pressure in its reservoir host.
Mild or symptomless symptoms are detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which indicates an adaptation between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats will decrease CoV-induced pathology efficiently.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of natural killer cell receptor inhibitors NKG2/CD94 and a low level of expression of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the bat's high metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect the exoribonuclease's excretion thus exerting selection pressure for the creation of highly pathogenic viral strains as they enter a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, which results in protein acquisition or new protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of the presence of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the activation of excessive immune response as well as cytokine storms, with lung damage getting more severe if the immune response gets stronger.
On the other hand, in symptomless carriers, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the linkage of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administering type I interferon, at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflamasome activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trajectory of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also CoV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although ferns and other animals on the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV pangolins that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may act as either intermediate hosts or beta-CoV pangolins may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV has returned to the limelight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV on human transmission.
A great deal of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and ferrets in wet markets, it may be the closure of the wet market and the killing of all ferns in it that ended the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of beta-CoV pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in the Arabian camel.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source for meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we successfully eliminate this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, potentially zoonotic bat CoVs are very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in the emergence of a new CoV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparations and countermeasures plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet since long ago.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there is an opportunity for spread.
Although bats have many traits that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Continued surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans must keep a distance from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of the puzzle of zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, the conditions when bats and pangolins share ecological niches are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way it interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and pangolins should be made clear.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, pangolins, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates to the diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be made
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fight the pandemic around the world.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
As an example of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with part of the context having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidance as well as being a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guidelines (the seventh version of the trial) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases it is necessary to combine one epidemiological history picture with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to fulfill three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas; or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported for the last 14 days.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal lymphocyte count, decreased, or decreased in the early stages of onset.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire viral genome showing high homogeneity for the new coronavirus known; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or positive changes in the viral genome
We can see that real-time PCR tests of nucleic acid in respiratory or blood vessel samples were added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification was based on the researchers' ongoing research to look for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood retrieval, which increased the availability of various specimens, and supported the inclusion of positive results of certain antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be aware of patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend to follow and adhere to the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death toll in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a record number of cases of infection that included 114 active cases and 33 home-dwelling recoveries.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maitree Kuwait Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Roads and Bridges Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be halted longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown has been in effect since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two people who had just returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection surpassed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day as Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia experienced its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries to remain free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region's quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russian citizens will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten votes abstained, and one vote rejected.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all day; earlier, the curfew only lasted between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended a stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lower the limit on toilet paper purchases per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia’s Woolworth and Coles chain of stores each lowered toilet tissue purchase limits to two and one pack per transaction at all stores on a national level.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on his network's Facebook page.
Buyers are reportedly piling up supplies due to fears of COVID-19 in case the public has to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to up to one pack per order.
This change follows a four-pack per transaction restriction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
In his March 8 media statement, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out in an hour since delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
Sales were “on a sharp rise” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles orders larger packs from suppliers and increases shipping frequency, Woolworths orders additional supplies, while ALDI makes supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase supplies, but the local government agency's restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
It anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had taken off supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a large volume item so that the quantity of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods is increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there is a lot of stuff on the shelves, if products like toilet tissue and dentures can be [bought] and exist in large quantities, panic may be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet tissue manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, stressed they are working 24/7 to keep the supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper wipes to the first bidder of the auction in Melbourne, as fewer auctions were held as buyers took breaks for the long Labor Day weekend break.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Shoppers are reluctant to implement restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report on March 3, they say they do not plan to implement purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizer, dry food, hand-washing soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO.
We are very wary both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity as well as because of the alarming rate of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been tracked from its emergence to the ongoing global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January which declared the outbreak a public health emergency that is troubling the world.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of this outbreak, "in essence, this outbreak is going to get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and is caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared as a World-Related Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate is estimated to be 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04<0x25> to 0.08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and the extent of the scarcity of supply of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed at both the national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation regarding this virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people coming from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions declined.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was carried out in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to become ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the aforementioned wet market cluster later.
Among the initial case clusters reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases in China.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and below making up 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60<0x25> of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79<0x25> of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For the unwell, the time from symptom progression to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75<0x25> have pre-existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deceased giving a positive test result for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figures are likely not to include people who died untested, for example, at home, at home care, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the announced number of deaths] is lower than the actual figure", a statement corroborated by a non-scientific report on too low calculations in the U.S. Too low calculations often appear in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, sex, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died from an undiagnised and undiagnised disease.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a particular population ranging from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates infection fatality rates for the pandemic overall between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The upper limit of this estimate range is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of this outbreak is unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without even controlling, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make current reasonable projections about when it happened".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "this outbreak may end in June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on rare measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's less likely that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The virulence of repetition will depend on the group's immunity and the rate of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of olfactory power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, chest depressed or chest pain settling, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms arise. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septics and bluishness.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked to make sure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44<0x25>.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the estimated number of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell initially 30<0x25>, then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Details about how the disease spreads are still being researched.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is a contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that a cough that is not covered can cause a droplet to be pushed 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplets may fall on the mouth or nose of a person who is nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make breathing secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Dispersal can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government dismissed the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-orally.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease.
People give positive results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have already been touched by an infected person.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All new features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronaviruses are genetically classed with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has 96<0x25> similarity in the entire genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the pangolin virus and the human virus.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found that there is at most 92<0x25> similarity in genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the pangolin is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done through a reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on an infected secretion or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharyngeal swabs, but throat swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) features in symptomatic people include opacity of peripheral glass asymmetry and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining comprehensive personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using tissue when coughing or sneezing and directly throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in different regions have restricted or appealed to stop all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community-scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who handle people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance proximity to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they are in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This suggestion is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60<0x25> by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71<0x25>, isopropanol 50–100<0x25>, sodium hypochlorite 0.1<0x25>, hydrogen peroxide 0.5<0x25>, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5<0x25>.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with elbows bent or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately remove the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and distance of expiratory droplets scattered when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch the face with hands that are not clean enough, which is a major source of transmission.”
The WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people who care for people with COVID-19, although the WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to a healthy community, especially when close to (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from public places without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the cafeteria to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, requires rail and intercity bus passengers to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time out of the house, and recommends making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an infection control act intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or appeal for social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations is rapidly reduced, ranging from 250 people (if there is no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the compromised immune system who have a risk of serious disease and higher complications are advised the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas that are experiencing outbreaks at the community level. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to change the use of the term "
The use of the term "social restriction" gives the impression that people should isolate themselves entirely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during times of the pandemic.
These recommendations include advice to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or viral symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued to people who belong to high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 sufferers and people who have recently traveled to countries or regions with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in epidemic control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, further efforts are moving to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and communities.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is attempting to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known as ramping up the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed on health services and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in these kinds of interventions; as well as measures at the level of environmental deterrence, such as other drastic measures aimed at surface cleansing.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and impose heavy fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and repression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) had great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be chosen, but needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise transmission will spike back rapidly as the suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have an impact on the social and economic.
No specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home-based treatments" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients was a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was handled by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who told CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Quite a number of unidentified pneumonia cases were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migrations during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and railway transit spot.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restricted free movement and made border controls.
National responses include containment measures, such as quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, on-site shelter order, or region quarantine) and curfew. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, were in some kind of territory quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were quarantined territory in the Philippines, about 59 million people were quarantined territory in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a kind of region quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, which is about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report showed the earliest cases on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; this observation was notified of his hospital to CDC Jianghan on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Communist Party general secretary <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been called the "largest quarantine in human history", cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited within the city.
Lunar New Year celebrations (January 25) are cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was also built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as a convention center and stadium, into a temporary hospital. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to stem the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing a health declaration for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implemented several measures, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
The measures to work remotely were applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movements is applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) face some sort of restrictions outside the home. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On March 23, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted domestically had essentially been blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the territory quarantine was imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa holders or residence permits will be suspended from March 28 onwards, without any specific details as to when this policy will end.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for the company. The State Council announced a day of mourning by starting a three-minute silence of national creation on April 4 at 10:00, in conjunction with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay respect online with regard to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely caused by a meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji adherents who visited Daegu from Wuhan are thought to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13<0x25> had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected and changed. South Korea introduced programs that are considered the largest and best organized programs in the world to filter the virus in the population, isolate every infected person, as well as track and quarantine people who come in contact with them.
Methods of filtering include the obligation to report symptoms independently by people who have just come from abroad via a mobile app, testing a lataturous virus or drive-thru with results available the next day, and increased testing capabilities to more than 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantined the entire city. At first, South Korea's public views were divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claims that the government made a mistake in dealing with the outbreak, or vice versa, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea was reported to have the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that starting 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 countries.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom and, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
The initial steps announced by the government include the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran is allocating five trillion reals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the affected areas, only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic ahead of the Persian New Year continued.
Shia places of worship in Qom remain open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.After China, Iran became the center of the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the outbreak rate in Iran was covered up, more than ten countries traced their cases back to Iran on February 28, suggesting that the outbreak rate may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
Iran's parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protests and, for the time being, release all eligible prisoners.
It is stated that there is a greater risk for the spread in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also do not have adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, which is the country's highest number since the start of the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 previous Iranian politicians or government officials have died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran faces 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there are likely to be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It also said that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Then, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to stem the outbreak, which included quarantines of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the area of the outbreak, people are not allowed to enter.
A suspension of work activities and sporting events has been ordered in the area."On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the Series A football games, will be held in closed-door until April, but on March 9, all sports are suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies, and on 6 March, the Italian High School of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding triage protocols that might be used.
On 19 March, Italy took over China's position as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic deaths.
On March 22, Russia reportedly sent nine military aircraft containing medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with most of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that what contributed to the high fatality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test all people infected with the virus.
The UK’s response to the virus was one of the slackest among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement that appealed to stop all travel and social contact was not essential and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of workers' wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which would ban meetings of more than two people and limit travel and outdoor activities only to activities deemed essential.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the granting of fines and the dissolution of the group.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for businesses deemed "essential", which included supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, a leading U.S. government public health agency, announced that they had developed their own test kits.
Nevertheless, the United States was slow in starting testing so as to obscure the actual outbreak rate at the time.
The testing was disrupted by a defective test instrument produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of approval for nongovernmental testing tools (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people eligible for testing until early March (a doctor's order was required thereafter).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reports that fewer than 4,000 tests have been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people have symptoms and doctor's orders wait for hours or days to be tested."After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, an action that was immediately followed by another state.

On March 25, the governor of New York said that social restrictions appeared to be successful as estimates of the addition of cases to double slowed from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City and 672 people died from the virus. On March 26, the United States reported more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, there were 400,335 confirmed cases in the United States and 12,841 people died.

Overall, approval of Trump's crisis management is divided across partisan ranks.
Several U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of essential materials from China, which includes essential medical supplies.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict the spread patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, the people traveling from Wuhan were the most in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne are also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali is reportedly the least capable in terms of readiness among the 20 most popular destination cities, while cities in Australia are considered the most capable. Australia released the Emergency Response Plan for the New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
It said that much remains undiscovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communication in response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, Australia declared a state of emergency for human life.

Medical screening was conducted prior to departure and four South Africans showing signs of coronavirus were left behind to reduce risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
Based on the results of the test, permits were issued to all South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions; as a precaution, all remained supervised and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began withdrawing part of its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

After the case China
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Entrepreneur Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective clothing to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
Later, he sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks, and 5 ventilators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about the quality of masks and Chinese-made test kits.
For example, Spain pulled 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with a accuracy rate of only 30<0x25>; meanwhile, the Netherlands pulled back 600,000 defective Chinese-made face masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable masks, thought to be from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa, and on 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and stemming the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up so as to impede prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the move was "clearly not WHO's recommendation," it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to stemming the epidemic at the site of the outbreak" and he called it "unprecedented" in the WHO's public health history.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have a qualified health system.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that impair international travel and trade unnecessarily" as well as "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, WHO called on the global community to contribute <0x24>675 million to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, citing an urgency to support countries that "have no system to detect people infected with the virus if the outbreak spreads."
Further, Tedros made a statement that "the limit of our strength is on the weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more expensive later."
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to give "response in the form of the exertion of the entire strength of the UN system".
Later, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which the WHO said would allow them to "focus on health responses, while other agencies could use their expertise to bear the impact of the outbreak in the wider social, economic, and development areas."
On 14 February, a joint China Mission Team led by WHO was activated; the team aims to provide international and WHO experts in China in order to assist domestic management as well as evaluate the "level of severity and transmission of disease" by holding workshops and meetings with related national agencies and to conduct field trips to assess "the impact of countermeasures at the provincial and district levels, which include the extent of the disease."
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent the Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of the coronavirus threat at the global level will be raised from "high" to "very high", this is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time every government on the planet faces the reality: Wake up.
This virus will probably come to your place and you should be ready," and urged that proper countermeasures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, as well as saying that such a declaration means "basically we accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that the WHO is "deeply concerned about the alarming level of spread and severity, as well as the alarming level of inaction."The WHO received scathing criticism for being deemed inadequate in dealing with the pandemic, which includes delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to file his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed to respect the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone is entitled to life-saving intervention and the government bears responsibility for this.
The group emphasizes that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as justification to discriminate against certain groups.
Experts underline that every individual has a right to health, including disabled people, minority groups, the elderly, internal escapees, the homeless, people living in very poor conditions, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are trying to deal with the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with viewpoints and advice.
From policies to strengthening the world’s health and economic systems to addressing the impact of region quarantines and travel restrictions, the digital center includes a State Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate coordinated global responses in the face of the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government received criticism from the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for the handling of the pandemic that started in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed relating to the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which was a sign of dissatisfaction with political institutions' response to dealing with outbreaks in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is meant to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier recognition of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 coming from the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. government of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up actions empower the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." This word was eventually criticized by some critics as racism and "distracted from his government's failure to deal with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government message outlining communication strategies and clearly originated in the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.
We are told to try and convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearing on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to the virus-affected countries are part of a propaganda push to affect the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a "geo-political component, which includes a battle for influence through the twisting of facts and 'political generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners."
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as reportedly send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid aimed at other countries to their own countries.
There have also been reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey picked up hundreds of ventilators aimed at Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China is responding bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a sign of good European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian soldiers to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defender exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise endangers not only the lives of U.S. troops and many European countries participating, but also the residents of the countries where they operate."
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding.
Political analysts suspect it could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are deteriorating due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, the South Korean public's views were divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the petition, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's mistakes in handling the outbreak, and praising its response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule by indefinite decree, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish people deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak is being blamed for a case of supply shortages, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak, panic buying, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Some areas also experience panic buying which results in a vacancy of basic needs, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, which triggers a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in electronic goods delivery.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protective devices has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also leads to a worldwide shortage of self-protective devices, and the WHO warns that this will harm health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared food shortages.
China and Italy's measures in the fight against the hoarding and illegal trade of important products succeeded so that an anticipated acute food shortage would occur in Europe and North America could be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure people’s nutritional adequacy.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which require food manufacturers to keep reserves for emergencies such as these.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures the government took to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5<0x25>.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is thought to be causing a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the market would remain volatile until there was a clearer picture of the potential for the final outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic fallout due to the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis says the outbreak is impacting more than <0x24>300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "scary" after petroleum prices fell sharply as demand from China dwindled.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, which include the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–2008.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a decline of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained Negative Outlook.
Stocks plummeted again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest decline occurring on March 16.
Many people think an economic recession might happen.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central and state bank's timely emergency move.
The central bank reacted faster than it did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors hardest hit due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government measures that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season related to the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and local governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions make up 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong is raising the fight against infectious diseases to the highest level and declaring a state of emergency, closing schools until March, and canceling New Year celebrations. The retail sector is impacted globally due to reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers experienced a 50–60<0x25> decline.
It also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world impose additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to estimates of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are displaced at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province, and by March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could cause a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32<0x25>. Quarantine territory in India causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. Surveys from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss in the middle of 2020 region. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since its March.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a government-subsidized short-term employment scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term employment compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Around the world, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, affecting the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent.
Art and cultural sector organizations seek to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of employees and the community, and support artists where possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were put forth to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another detrimental impact of the disease that is latest and very rapidly developing is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion shows.
The film industry was also disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Lenten Christian season of repentance, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, online live broadcast or television, while others offer drive-in worship or laminations.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the vacancy of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday the cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and places of worship were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events are cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
The outbreak disrupted the plans of the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but not later than summer 2021." Worldwide, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new enrollment. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or cancelling concert tours.
Many major theaters such as Broadway also delayed all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) noted racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or accept what they claim is a deserved reward.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination due to their area's origin.
There is already support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak's development into new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in rates of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students coming from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities are reportedly being harassed over the coronavirus outbreak.
President of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "miserable".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign rubbish" and targeted for "exile".
Many newspapers that use paid blocking have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make plague-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on pre-printed servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or still active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and surveillance of populations.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have already contracted, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has yet had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and there is great variation in the number of tests that countries have conducted.
This variability may also significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal sputum swabs or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat swab are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep airways by using a suction catheter or the material released through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection device on January 28, 2020.
The device looks for the "E" gene that all coronavirus betas have, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Distributed CoronaR-CoV-2 (2019)
One in three genetic tests on the old version of the test device gave inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until after that that that state labs and local laboratories were allowed to perform the testing.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. The U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no announced quantity limits; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be carried out within 3.5 hours of high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Geologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because it does not require a series of temperature switching cycles, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (protein N) are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "thorax photographs have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may already exist before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions.
The dominance of subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtration.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after symptom onset, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. The examination can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
High-yield automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these checks, but their availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is generally used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide the agency with the necessary notice and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than conventional PCR examination of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody tests it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong drew up a scheme in order for suspected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give specimen tubes to patients," they spit into it, send it back, and get test results moments later. NHS UK announces that the NHS is pioneering a suspected case-testing scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect an ambulance.
The lantature testing center has helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest testing of any country. On March 2, the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, lantature tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6,9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Hospital Technion and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, combining samples and only testing further.
With its construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47<0x25> higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity does not exist.
Wuhan labs were soon followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handling.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had become obstacles for mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating the sample at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita of the population than any country, and was ready to scale up the testing to reach most of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of latour testing and the purchase of a population-scale mass-produced laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, it is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus' genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of test kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop on their own.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28 thus slowing the testing available in the U.S. Early in the outbreak, China and the United States were troubled with the reliability of the test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet health experts' requests and testing recommendations.
Instead, experts say that the extensive availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing awaiting work in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents becoming precarious.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test kits.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC had a "defect"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by privateers. Spain purchased the test tools from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be the result of a failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would pull equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that these test tools be thrown into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said the test tools Turkey bought from China had "high error rates" and they did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test tools from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that these test tools could not be used.
The testing, which was followed by quarantine of positive people and tracking of people in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first deaths from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, at a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions to this community, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on 23 March.
Several other countries also dealt with the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territory quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality rate, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people who had mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "<0x25> Positive test results" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test people who are hospitalized will have a higher <0x25> positive result than countries that test all of their residents, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors in common.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning someone's hands that aims to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are essential for washing hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of sick people.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to wash your hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce infant mortality at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased handwashing practices may slightly increase the high growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease by almost 50<0x25>.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in diarrhoea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as unconscious behaviors are carried out in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of toddler death; the disease causes about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing your hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet becomes an embedded habit that can save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical measure, as well as reducing diarrhoea deaths by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects yourself from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Hand washing too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of the disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (waste, defecation), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Another important time to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent disease transmission is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7<0x25> of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Now there are several behavioral change methodologies available to improve the adoption of hand washing habits with soap at the critical time.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scale measures to support the health and education of children.
Giving worm medicine twice a year, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleaning microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main job of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the solution and increase the soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are components of organic dirt, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fat and protein is helped by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that examined the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were exposed to foam.
However, the CDC continues to state that "liquid soaps whose discharge from containers without touching hands are preferred."
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there has been no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (aloe, vitamin, menthol, plant extracts).
Warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soapy water is more effective compared to cold soapy water in removing natural oils that hold dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to the beliefs of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents in the form of non-water-based alcohol scrubs (also called alcohol-based hand scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these hygienic agents are isopropyl alcohol or ethanol-formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel or alongside a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity further. Hand-carrying containing at least 60-95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Rubbish alcohol infestation kills bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (covering HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic saturation containing 70<0x25> alcohol kills 99.97<0x25> (log reduction of 3.5, similar to 35 decibels reduction) bacteria on the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> to 99.99<0x25> (log reduction of 4 to 5) bacteria on the hand 1 minute after use. Hand aviation is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type of virus, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate amount of hand antiseptic or alcohol scrub should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and ends of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds into a liquid, foam, or dry gel.
Finger tips should also be washed well by rubbing them in two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand scrubbing, especially when hands look dirty.
Increased use of a disinfecting agent due to ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, a disinfecting agent should not be used as a substitute for correct hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer use can often cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused skin irritation and dryness much lower than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
A lower tendency causes disturbing contact dermatitis to become the attraction of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-watering agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still at hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, this product performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbing.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side-effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if it comes into contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Water flows are recommended because the silenced basin may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to have no effect.
Brush your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer to remove more germs.
Wash thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing inside the basin can re-contaminate the hands.
Dry it with a dry wipe or let it dry in the air.
Wet, moist hands are more easily recontaminated. Often missed areas are the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from jerigen or bottled and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
Tippy taps are a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more research shows that paper wipes are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare the level of paper lap hygiene, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194<0x25> in the knuckles and 254<0x25> in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer led to a 42<0x25> increase in the total amount of bacteria on average in the knuckles and 15<0x25> in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper wipe, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76<0x25> in the knuckles and 77<0x25> in the palm of the hand.Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms off the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper wipes do not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the amount of bacteria were observed:
There are many manufacturing hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper wipes.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand-carrying should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in large quantities or gels to rub and rub each part of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed with each other’s fingers.
If there is dirt under the nail, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can survive in the water on hand, hands need to be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a clean wipe.
After drying, a paper wipe is used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care order is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("gums") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can lower catheter-related blood flow infections rates by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standard hand washing and hand rubs in the healthcare sector.
WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Seconds" to Wash Hands:
After exposure to blood/liquid body
before the aseptic task, and
after patient treatment. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill hand washing materials.
Such killing function may be desired before surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To ‘scratch’ hands before surgical surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodine washers, sterile wipes to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to scrub and other sterile instruments to clean.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms all the way to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the forearm should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After finishing washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling the sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20<0x25> of washing, and that the additional benefit gained was very little when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap resulted in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food than washing with antibacterial soap. Comparisons between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solutions and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand scrubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubs to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in the healthcare setting can involve education for staff about hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand scrubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions across various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing faucets near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although there are options for making cheap hand-washing places.
However, low levels of hand washing can also occur due to habits that have been embedded and not due to lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to run effectively, supervision and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that a community-based approach was effective in improving hand washing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of encouraging hand washing in schools was the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, schools can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a hand wash can be part of a campaign to promote hand washing to reduce child illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of behavioral change. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promotes the use of hand washing emojis.
Several studies examined the effectiveness of overall hand washing costs in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of years lost to illness.
One review showed that promoting hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective instead of other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a stench called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and health-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases.
For example, the "right hand washing technique" poster was hung next to the hand washing sink in public toilets as well as in office and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase “wash your hands off” means to express someone’s reluctance to take responsibility for something or to be involved in something.
The expression comes from the biblical passage in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands continuously to clean up imaginary stains; an act that shows her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation had a smaller impossibility involved in "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religion commands hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual part of hand washing in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also commands hand washing after certain acts of cleanliness, especially
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the location of the job and the task of the job, which is based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other co-workers; for this work, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to contagion in an ongoing community or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective against sneezing, and providing personal protective equipment when meeting COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health workers and mortuaries exposed to people who are known or suspected of suffering from COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, people known or suspected of suffering COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and self-protective devices that fit the job's duties.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to obtain these items (such as shopping outside of rush hour, through delivery, or lataturity).
Finally, shipments of goods from highly affected geographic areas can be disrupted. Preparedness and an infectious disease management plan can be used to guide protective measures.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and occupational tasks, including the source of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The preparedness and treatment plan for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of epidemic management includes reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the countermeasures taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
If the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical control, followed by administrative control, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Technical controls include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in an employment policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent partial exposure.
All types of APD should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirator), worn consistently and properly, inspected, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and garbage containers, preparing for work remotely or working shifts with gradual arrival/return times, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment routinely, and doing cleaning and disinfecting work.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms should stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing drugs or other symptom-reducing drugs, and that the sick leave policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and for employees to be aware of this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes work requiring close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or due to a new person traveling internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population densities, and high-volume retail establishments such as workstations and maintenance workers. This includes installing high-efficiency air filters, improving ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing drive-thru windows and lamantours for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include installing air filters.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect the worker and other passengers includes separating the sick person from another person by 6 feet, appointing one cabin crew member to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or asking him to cover the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews should wear medical gloves once-wearing when caring for a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body or surface fluids and possibly other protective devices if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in pockets of biological hazards, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including yachts and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating oneself, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is carried out in the cabin of an isolated person. Regardless of the spread in the community, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person is ever in the school building.
If there is community transmission at a minimal to moderate level, a social restriction strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in a cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in local communities, in addition to social distancing strategies, extending school closures may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and duty equipment before reuse by using spray or household cleaning wipes and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers health workers and certain morgues to be at a high or very high risk of exposure.
High exposure risk work includes providing health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes at a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an aerosol-producing procedure on, or retrieves or handles specimens of, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen retrieval.
The work of the mortuary at high risk of exposure includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technique control for this risk group includes isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure vents may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens should be treated with Biological Safety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 face mask respirators or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothes or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people taking breathing specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If the aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical barriers such as invisibility windows, with only people involved in direct care may enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, use only the required APD for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same symptoms, monitor and coordinate the supply chain.

SUBJECT BARIS: [Covid-19] Relieves the burden and prepares for the future
EST/LIKE TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSE: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes clear the global human connection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
We have never experienced the challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and development of the global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we have witnessed among all our co-workers through email, calls, and chats is a tremendous validation of the incredible human presence, which we are fortunate enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride are endlessly able to refer to you as my co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is an emblem for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays up, helps pay our associates, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially today.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met overnight to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We are eager to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for a loved one, shop for basic necessities, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not need to be said, but we say it.
A sick leave or PTO is not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure major areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please tell Bryan inside T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Fellows whose hourly wages are based will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it once again, in honor of our commitment to fellow contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when conditions are normal.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that need to go on.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust <0x26> Security, as well as the Fundraising team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, we will only focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will be nothing for the future.
We do not plan to "overtime work catching up" after this pandemic has passed.
You won’t be expected to work overtime to meet current unrealistic deadlines.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will work to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to the new realities and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intent is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to create a budget so that employees can prioritize the important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressures across the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team at the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety protocols by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are delighted that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved into a full-fledged remote work order, in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we’re also discussing hiring a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but will probably be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues who have worked long distances are aware that it may need adjustments and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting to one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, create an agenda, and send the reading material in advance.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Appoint leaders to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and keep a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do collaborative note-making).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small meals.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the improvement of work distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand our requests for cancellations and other restrictions may make them unlikely to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be the sadness of this disruption, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is in one place.
We also seek to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly impacted.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to notify and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations at HR International.
Let no one of these changes be seen as a neglect of our work and obligations.
Rather, this change is an acknowledgment that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in these situations so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support our movement needs, and provide the world the services they rely on.
The work that we planned before would be there awaits us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and possibly the next few months.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a terminal-N-peptidase M2 domain and a terminal-C renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-stranded membrane protein of type I, with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes especially type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial endothelial cells and veins, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradicin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of protein S1 to spikes or protrusions of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
This virus entry process also requires priming of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact leads people to hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help combat infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34<0x25> decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work start in addition to a 24-hour duration effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin (RAS) system inhibitors or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. Infusions of rhACE2 have been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracking to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of users of the application.
An alternative that doesn’t overinfuse privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
The app is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking app is in an advanced development stage and will be available for deployment in a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering an app based on the TraceTogether Singapore app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; it is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if the data the application takes is limited to a small portion of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous “coronavirus” apps, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, which is limiting only to “official” or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon are implementing similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly regarding whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be halted once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization states eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance shall be "legally, necessary, and proportionate";
expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data shall be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all “relevant stakeholders” are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. Germany’s Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issue checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-application-based systems are used to conduct contact tracking.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text message to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the location information available to the public, which is permitted by extensive changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using both a centralized system and a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting from at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record users' proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Nearness Tracking that Protects Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Number, CEN), Protocols and Mechanisms
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy while collecting and using location or flow-intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, the company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a widely overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving widespread acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
Launch of tools to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the problem of data retrieval and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through an operating system update, then deleting it in the same way after the threat has passed.
Repositioning a drug (also called assigning a new purpose, new profile, or new task to a drug or therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for the purpose of a new treatment, i.e. for a disease or medical condition different from the original purpose of drug development.
It is a path of scientific research currently under way to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein having multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of the ligand binding sites could be the basis of a project for the development of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofatase.
Hussein A, et al. researched several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed for their skeletal resemblance to an approved drug and had the highest spire to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that the associated chloroquine and hydrochloroquine were two of the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they used the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting safety and efficacy trials of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved to be "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a 4-day median, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminded the public that the evidence there was to support the drug was little and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. This drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a multiplication virus.
This medication may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
It is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community regarding resource direction for repositioning drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against several filo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to disease and more severe transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with moderate disease and another for people who are seriously ill.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began trials for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with new, presymptomatic coronavirus infections.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases being treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective methods of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients thus encouraging the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients examining the use of sodium enoxaparin at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment goals to antiviral drugs that were approved and developed for earlier outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics are identified potentially as new goals for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease's causative virus, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in a Phase I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what should be considered in developing the vaccine is speed, production capacity, deployment on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of major platforms advancing to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials performed initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually conducted at random, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more appropriate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involved more participants, including the control group, and tested the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates currently being actively developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "practical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular clamping vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it began developing the vaccine, with a target of testing on humans by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were starting to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were starting a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
Further, the partnership announced a plan for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development took at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with testing on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "a large sum of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get preclinical testing results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stages can start testing on humans in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced a US<0x24>4.9 million investment in a consortium of COVID-19 vaccine research involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investments in the development of COVID-19 vaccines reaching US<0x24>29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could self-amplify for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a C<0x24>275 million fund for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a C<0x24>192 million special fund to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to set up a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "MNA that administered the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine raises a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that begins to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, which are also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
Further randomised trials in Australia sought to include 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, showed the need for containment measures to reach biological safety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no protective drug or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, a proven vaccine for MERS does not yet exist.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts echoed conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 had been known before and that vaccines had been available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of olfactory power, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and failure of the compound organ.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between humans during close contact, often through small splashes or droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or while talking.
Although produced while breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and after later stages of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of a mask is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those who treat it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend against using masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include persistent breathing difficulties, pain or tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty getting up, and bluish faces or lips; medical stretching is immediately advised if these symptoms appear.
Symptoms of upper breathing, such as sneezing, sneezing, or a sore throat can be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of people who are symptomatic will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain symptomless during hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began to include symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78<0x25>) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral charges on a large scale.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that is not covered can cause a droplet to be pushed as far as 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is usually not transmitted by air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and that air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce samples that are positive for the virus's RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make breathing secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products decompose the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, and free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The 2nd severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All new features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronaviruses that are related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell through the angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in pulmonary type II alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12<0x25> of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
Incidents of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and high venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocyte-secreting IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltration has also been reported on autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This testing is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate these coronavirus strains and publish their genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infection by this virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been previously infected) are under development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with the testing showed only 60 to 70<0x25> accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use by the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions is widely encountered at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can arise as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and multiple nucleated giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the stage of healing: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminata (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from cloth in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social distancing strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
As the vaccine is anticipated not to exist until early 2021, a major part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flaming the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Further the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60<0x25> alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizer is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they are carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Self-cleansing and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to treat hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and pulmonary experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into free resources, i.e. IBCC.
As of April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health care order when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers treating COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AAIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne prevention measures. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (APD) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use on the label.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protector or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are severe.
This type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods results in the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Heavy cases are more common in the elderly (people over 60, and especially people over 80).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system’s capacity to handle a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases that is severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> entered intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized eventually enter the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure and PEEP control modes are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung and pneumothorax injuries.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
WHO-recommended volunteers participate in trials of potential treatment effectiveness and safety. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in case a person's life is severely or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘close contacts’ using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. The data analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The move was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed aggregated phone location data to the German federal government's Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told mobile phone operators that "40<0x25> of citizens are still moving around".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are the perfect storms that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can occur mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In people most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6<0x25> of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4<0x25> of this group.
About 20-30<0x25> of people with a picture of COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between symptom onset and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median seven-day time between hospitalization and death.
In a study that examined early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25>, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of hospitalized people have congenital conditions. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The lack of a mild case count can cause the death rate to be too high.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases taking place in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not yet known if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely to be obtained, if it looks at other coronavirus behaviors, but there have been reported cases of recovering COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
The case is believed to be a deteriorating residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and comes from animals, through an infection that spreads.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the earliest onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the handling options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for laboratory-diagnosed or epidemiological COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality-to-case ratio is 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from certain diseases, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who die from certain diseases.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a particular population ranging from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7<0x25>) had already died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and the possibility of not all COVID-19 deaths being classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3<0x25> of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0,004<0x25> of the population) were conflated to die from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for both men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference in risk between men and new women not apparent by the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this difference based on gender is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reasons.
Immunological differences based on gender, a lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected people are men and 72<0x25> of people who die from COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory diseases as temporary names for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines that appealed not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital was in dire need of ventilator valves, and suppliers could not deliver in the time scale required, a local company engineered-back and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and misinformation sprang up regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to examine the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research into SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under study.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (a DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
An experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to determine its safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased antibody-dependent has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The new purpose-given antiviral drugs make up most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting deadline by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates already exists.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which includes remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that doubling the dose is extremely dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition of the Chinese guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxsanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming of bulge proteins by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in the severe COVID-19 of advanced stages.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisitokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study is completed.
The drug is undergoing a phase 2 nonaccustomed test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is a viable treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinated passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid part of the patient's blood that has been cured and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
