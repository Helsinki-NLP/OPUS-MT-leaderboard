Welsh AM fears 'appearing muppets'
There is a growing fear among some AMs over the proposal to change their title and make them MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was the result of a plan to change the name of the assembly and make it the Welsh Parliament.
People from all walks of life are afraid to make fun of it.
A member of the group said they were concerned that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not from Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp is tae.
An AM from Plaid said the group was "not happy" at all and that they had already proposed replacements.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" in changing the name, but he also said the MWP was not far from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English is similar.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently proposing the law to change the name: "Any final decision on what the Assembly Members shall call the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received wide support calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for what to call the AMs, the Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultations.
AMs are likely to be exchanged, but the head of the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, is likely to strike a deal with everyone, who is expected to file a bill within a few weeks.
The child in the reforms will include other changes in the running of the assembly, including the rules for the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
It's up to the AMs to vote on what to call them when they're already debating the law.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on changing the country's name
There will be a vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name and make it the "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will be held in a bid to resolve decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it owns its territory and that Athens has repeatedly objected to its request to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is protesting the name change plebiscite, said he would not respect the vote.
However, those who supported the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, changed the name to become part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Vows to Silence as Churches in Harlem Suffer
"In the past, the old man I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church in every corner, what Mr. Adams said.
"Now, there's nothing."
He said the loss of the bars was understandable.
"People today are different," he said.
"It's no longer the town's fault the bars where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he feared that it would not take as long as the leaders expected the money to be recovered from the sale of the property, "they would soon also return to where they had started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who would not be able to help the community's remaining sanctuaries.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "so it will only speed up the day when these churches will close permanently because the people who live in these condominiums will be far away from those churches."
White congregations built the same church before the Harlem-Community Metropolitan became a black metropolis in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation that worshiped nearby the building took its title.
The black congregation dominated St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, that opposed the acceptance or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a 1939 fire, but as Father Johnson's customers were making plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, called the carillon "the worms of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural resource" and "an irreplaceable and versatile instrument."
University of Michigan's Tiffany Ng is the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been entered by non-Ordinary church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
Writing to the diocese in July the vestry - the ruler of the parish, composed of non-ordered chiefs - concerned the "passing the expenses" of the diocese over the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the reception of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty on the part of the diocese.
Shark bites 13-year-old who dives for lobster in California
A shark attacked and bitten a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for half an hour on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a young boy calling for help and approached him with his group to pull him out of the water.
When he heard the lobster, he thought he was just excited about the lobster catch, but "I realized the boy was screaming, 'I'm biting!
I got bitten!"
"It's been a long time coming," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I screamed all the way through the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift, where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not clear what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago but it was not identified as a dangerous species of shark.
He added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and for safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in a department store style with specialist assistants.
As an integral part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and household apparel sales fall, it will try out larger beauty aisles in 11 stores nationwide, and will be added next year if it becomes a success.
Beauty investment is on the rise as supermarkets look for ways to fill up shelf spaces that were previously used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their beauty sales by up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also re-introduce its Boutique makeup products so that most of what it sells will favor vegans - something that more and more younger consumers are asking for.
The fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, will try to sell at two Sainsbury's stores, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming part of the year.
Shopping online and shopping for less and less food every day at local convenience stores has led supermarkets to make more effort to encourage people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said department stores will look more like outlets as the supermarket chain fights off discounts such as Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has housed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered some Habitat since they bought the same chain two years ago, which they say has contributed to the increase in grocery sales and led to a growth in the revenue of the purchased companies.
The supermarket's last attempt to rehabilitate their beauty and pharmacies department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stopped after there was an argument over how to split profits from its chemist stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy originated after Sainsbury's for <0xC2><0xA3>125m sold their pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
According to Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in colleagues with particular training and are willing to give advice.
The entirety of our brands is designed to cater to every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean we are the people's leading destination for beauty that challenges the old-fashioned way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby backed out of <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has stepped down from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for Truly, their brand of home appliance and accessories.
The pair's business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning's performer, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby replaced Dragons Den star Peter Jones with a sudden withdrawal from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on her bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "outraged" when the TV golden girl admitted at an intensive meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of their giant business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she no longer had time for Truly, their brand of home appliances and accessories, fueled by her new agreements - which would reach a value of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 milli.
The business had already been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was determined to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source: "Today, Truly is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that would cross him over the next decade.
Everyone was very surprised by his departure.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, even if it's too close to the inauguration.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow HQ ready for sale."
Experts believe the company will lose millions of performers this morning, one of Britain's most profitable personalities, due to huge investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothes and household appliances, and those that could delay its inauguration.
And it can serve as the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador of M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity by ITV.
A source close to Jones said "We will not comment on his business issues."
"We were friends, and then we became friends"
He joked about the criticisms he would receive from the news media for comments that could be called "unpresidential" and for being too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's voice echoes the voice of the "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have been delayed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "equivalent action" from the U.S. in their work on disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continued to tighten restrictions to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a more positive view of his speech at the rally.
"We're in good hands with North Korea," he said.
"We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had resulted in positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to look like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to people directly in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a preliminary condition to spur foreign aid.
"In many instances, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for help abroad, so it is quite difficult," said Bb.
While the team is still working on the project, it's unclear if the team will be able to work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster bureau, said Indonesian officials were still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international bureaus would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite Indonesia's frequent earthquakes, they are still not prepared for the storms of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning already in effect, is likely to have reduced lives as well.
During the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters are making the logistics worse.
An Optional ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is currently on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's deplorable infrastructure central to his election campaign, and has already provided a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, there is a lack of funding for Mr. Joko's administration due to his upcoming re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from remaining sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where most Muslims embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands were left homeless as Christian and Muslim groups clashed in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other old-fashioned weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge to face off against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea when he scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
<0x58>herdan Shaqiri scored 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team went 1-0 down.
He wanted to turn the ball over before being kicked to the far post of the goal.
The ball flew to the top of the box and flew it into the upper right corner of the net.
Later, the ball crashed into the net behind the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It was just in the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq are always trying to play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to take all the time I could get," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so I did it on a kick and I didn't think much about it and I just kept the rest."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went into the midfield band and made his way to Liverpool's side of the field.
Kovacic was quick to give-and-go in midfield.
He lived in a comfortable through ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard cleared the defence and settled with the left foot in the net of the far post just past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia was 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster bureau on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of the building that collapsed due to Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused waves to reach 20 feet, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the bureau, at a news conference.
The ruins of the collapsed buildings in Palu City, with more than 380,000 people.
A 32-year-old man is believed to have been shot and killed by police
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stabbings at 7:55am in Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have already urged anyone in the area who has seen or heard of them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun but I call on anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard of any suspicious contact with us.
I'm also calling on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have taken any footage on the dashcam to contact us because they could have information important to our investigation."
A police spokesman in Birkenhead confirmed the woman was found and she was inside a property.
This afternoon, friends came to believe they knew the woman to ask where she had found her this morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are informing the incident to close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his flat but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman burst into tears at the scene.
He said repeatedly that it was "scary."
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon while another van was just outside.
There are several police officers standing inside the cordon and monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is required to dial DM at <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament's latest monument targeted by conflict over 'historical change'
It was a wise justice to remove it because of its Taliban-savvy destruction of England's vast cultural and religious artefacts carried out by its Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "planning to change history."
John Goldsmith, manager of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the image of Oliver Cromwell will be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or execute the destruction of sacred images during the civil wars in England.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake will be sacrificed because of the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent creation of Cromwell's opinion in the 19th century and part of the study of history by a man many believe is still worth celebrating.
G Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many regard Cromwell, perhaps more in the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, the monarchy.
There is still a lot of debate about whether this statement is accurate.
It is only certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a unique figure representing one aspect of that division.
It is also important to celebrate and remember his achievements as a Lord Protector."
The Man Who Killed a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead and with a severed artery, bleeding near a pig's cage in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig carer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a barn on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she discovered an open door in a nearby pig pen.
He said there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs had been slaughtered by the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs are swollen and twisted, which is what his cousin, known only by his surname "Wu," told the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
Yuan and his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
According to an Evening News market manager, the pig has been detained for no further assault, while police are gathering evidence in the area.
According to the report, there was negotiations between Yuan's family and market authorities for the payment of his death.
Although rare, there have been cases where pigs have previously been recorded attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig clung to the Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife threatened to drive the animal away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive but may have served to "pull" the taste of blood on them.
"They're just playing games.
They like to be overly aggressive, they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to respect them," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remaining strength will bring widespread and heavy rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is already weakening as it heads into the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 Hurricane, had sustained winds of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a convection trough over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastward toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will make the upcoming trough a wide, heavy rainstorm in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, drainage of debris, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapid worsening of conditions due to the nature of the tropical rain.
It's not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Canyons can become torrential rivers because of heavy rain, and thunderstorms can bring local strong winds and dust gusts.
The upcoming depression will bring local heavy rains to some parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall can reach a total of more than half an inch, which can cause a slight flow of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during its rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the rain spreads on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain fell on the four corners of the city on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, October sees severe temperature fluctuations across the U.S., while the tropics remain relatively warm.
In some cases, it causes extreme temperature changes over long distances.
There is a good example of extreme differences in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between the cities of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to get stronger and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected to cover much of the central and eastern U.S. from the Southern Plains to parts of the North East.
New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees higher than usual.
Our long-term weather report says the high probability of higher than average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the breathtaking testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to strip her of her at a high school party.
In a heated testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent certain that had not happened.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting the people who are watching in the offices.
To be more clear, it corresponds to the number of viewers of the football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel led the networks, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, with approximately 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 1.3 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS caught him on Friday morning shouting at protesters as they took the elevator to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down as he was insulted for several minutes, and released it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth?
He said, "You have power, but many women don't have power."
Before the elevator closed, Flake said his office issued a statement, which at the hearing of the committee he would say more.
Broadcast live hours after all cable and broadcast networks, while the Judiciary Committee must vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate to vote.
But Flake says he will only do so because his understanding is that the FBI will investigate allegations against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats are already pushing.
Flake was somewhat persuaded by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was in power, as it was clear that Republicans would not reach the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'political' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside May on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "false nonsense."
Shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police obtained the mirror at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, WAFB, CBS affiliate, reported.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set at <0x24>350,000, The Advocate reports.
The Coroner's Office of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head that pierced the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police Fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for assisting in the investigation prompted by the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for its "industry and pursuit of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always remember," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached homes south of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater rose and registered 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of irritation and shaking.
Photos on social media can be seen of thin ash wrapping up car windshields in areas of Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash against separatists in Catalan ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with pro-independence protesters at the riot police, and while thousands joined the opposition's actions to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's defiant vote on the ouster.
A group of masked pro-separatists pelted the riot police with eggs and made black dust clouds on the streets usually full of tourists.
The police were also in a riot at night and used batons to control the fighting.
For hours, pro-independence groups called for "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in front of unionists protesting to shout, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained at the protests, local newspaper reported.
Tensions remained high in the region calling for independence after a year of a referendum on October 1 that Madrid deemed illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose to vote independently, although few voted because most of the vacancy voters boycotted the polls.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to block polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent action supporting the national police.
The action continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer looked forward to Catalonia's possibility of gaining independence.
"Last year, we had one of our greatest moments.
I watched my parents cry because they were voting but we're not moving forward now," he said.
Despite the late regional election victory last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have found it difficult to vote this year because many of their famous leaders have been self-imposed exile and are awaiting hearings because of their role in organizing the referendum and in what has become a declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on her phone a protest supporting the police, said politicians on both sides had fueled the dispute.
"It's just getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate in a European election is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic principles and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men arrested after a car crashes into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
There may also be a crossbow in the car.
Menga's Tire, Livingston win against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's victory
Rising Livingston surprised Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
It was Dolly Menga's turn that required Gary Holt's team to equalize in the Hiberian second.
Gerrard's team remain winless in the Premiership this season and will face the top-seeded Hearts with eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their unbeaten play in the division to six games, with head coach Holt, who has not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chance against bruschetta visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored, if not for their being a direct cause of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a pass, but tried to get a touchdown, and Alan Lithgow's kick went away as Craig Halkett's header met him.
The hosts were content to play the Rangers in front of them, because they knew they could torture the visitors at the designated points.
And that's how the big goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston got a chance, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up to support Menga, who got the ball and scored from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had got the ball but had a hard time getting through the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a little difficulty,
The game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow settled away from Livingston's other set play.
Moves continued to be made to Livingston's side and were also continued to be repelled, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were ignored.
'Wonderful' from Livingston - review
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Wonderful game and results for Livingston.
With one person, they are good, continuing to exceed expectations for increased development.
Their playing style and character hasn't changed much since they've been the best again, but a lot of praise should go to Holt for his motivation with the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, leading the organized defense, while Menga tortured Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, however, lacked the inspiration.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
Their last ball failed - they only opened their side once - and it seemed to be a call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an got mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to smooth relations between NATO allies.
They argued over issues of human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's ascension to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police blocked 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - also called for Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Two different protests mirror the divisive visitor who is considered a hero by some Turk Germans and criticized as a dictator by others.
Deptford road wreck: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died after a car collided in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working on finding out the man's identity and informing his relatives.
Buses and other roadways were closed and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were injured in the riot at the men's high security detention facility, the Prison Office said.
The unrest at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire began at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is currently ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were sent to deal with the riot, which could hold eight prisoners and be kept in one wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have been sent to deal with the ongoing HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff were treated for the injuries.
We do not allow violence in our police stations, and we make it clear that those who are responsible will be brought to the police and that they can be detained for a longer period of time."
There are more than 500 inmates in HMP Long Lartin, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the police officer had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called into the jail to address a serious riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Sudden Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but that could happen early next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosa's strength passes through the Desert Southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued emergency flood monitoring for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will approach Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with scores of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to reach 1 to 2 inches (1 to 4 inches) in length.
For those who are not at risk of flash flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is drought-stricken.
Although the flooding is serious, this rain is likely to be beneficial because the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe droughts, the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is planning to make landfall on Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Still with hurricane strength and maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Typhoon Rosa was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler waters in the Pacific and would therefore weaken.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe, bringing with it a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected in Baja California to northwest Sonora, potentially reaching 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Typhoon Rosa then travels to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which then passes through Arizona as far south as Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected in Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash flooding and deflation in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stabbings in Somerset.
The teenager was seen wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested by night in the area of Radstock, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone with footage of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh was 'tortured' by "violence, by anger" of the Democratic Party, Trump says
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to dismiss the Democratic Party's brutal and violent tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "tortured" by "violence, anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying the allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she raped him decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also pleaded guilty to the charge.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people have seen Kavanaugh's strength and quality and courage" on that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a mechanized history of public service," he said at a rally of supporters in West Virginia.
Kavanaugh's nomination was mentioned by the President in a speech about the voting value of Republicans in the midterm election.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not going to run, but I'm going to run," he said.
"Everywhere I go, I'm fighting for a good candidate."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was "to fight and prevent."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, as expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, most of whom were washed away by giant waves on the beach, when an earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) hit the beach at dusk, with most of their deaths and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach and did not immediately leave and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"It didn't go through without a tsunami, it dragged cars, houses, it hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach.
Others climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were displaced in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed dozens of damaged buildings and shops, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the city at the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have been affected by a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technolog, BPPT, said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, positioned at the end of the long and narrow bay, could have boosted the strength of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of other victims were seen trapped under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and injuries could be higher along the beach 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communication "as a whole has been cut off without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not announce that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building shouting out fears of approaching tsunami warnings to people on the road below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach, since buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has just reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to more than 800.
It's too big.
While World Vision staff from Donggala, where employees were staying in tarpaulin shelters built on their backyard, they saw scenes of damage on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
While relief groups have already begun the grim start of the disaster relief movement, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, equipment, and personnel from other countries can only begin to arrive if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This disaster is still at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government has said, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we will be open to foreign aid but there is no current situation."
As the second night in Palu comes after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family continue to look forward to those who have lost loved ones with miracles that can inspire depressing stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers were able to remove a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games which finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people who were detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," she says.
Mr. Gendon recalled that, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who participated in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a grey check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think what that means is that the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 as ATMs are being repaired in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves swept away <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling ATM contents in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The contents of the vehicle driver remove an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepare to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he is busy, another man "runs from behind Brink's staff" and steals a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses fled the area, according to the release, but police did not specify the number of culprits involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name - to Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The once-recognised Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, and he used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said earlier this year in discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means being alone, to being Ye alone - to being just a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album better reflects who we are."
He was one of the few rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his fondness for the names Love and Brother Love.
With or without a name, West collaborated with Jay-Z.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliatory attacks against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to subdue Mexican citizens."
Troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, in which up to 300 people were killed at a time when leftist student movements across Latin America were taking root.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican children by providing monthly aid to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are pulling young people into criminal groups.
U.S. funding should be double A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments were made after the U.S. government made advertisements about AI, even though the U.S. lacked a formal AI strategy as a whole.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: it aims to be No.1 in transition to AI by 2030.
"It's a good start to doubling the AI research budget, as the U.S. has largely abandoned all other countries, and we're looking for the next success in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances that the U.S. will make the next big AI success, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he was preoccupied with an AI system that defeated the best American player of the Otherllo, after which, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology contests such as the Robotics Challenge by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next contest would be held, to help identify future visionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get help from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the top academics; it's not corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes would help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to those with a PhD in AI," he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but lower quality academic work in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to recruit partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has yet to see action seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence within months.
Canadians vote to change the name of the country in a referendum
Macedonia's citizens voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that would settle a decades-long rift between Greece that blocks its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, asserts its territorial claim to the name of its neighboring country to the north and denies the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist allies argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to come into force.
This was the stated question on the ballot in the referendum: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership along with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth seeking access to groups like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if not covered by the law, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the poll results in order to ratify it.
The change of name required a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only at 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted because of my children, we're in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and son Dushko have voted for a referendum on Macedonia to change the country's name that will open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and holding seats in front of tents arranged by boycotters in the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the ranks high-noo and not enter the door of the servants" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the big majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that the "yes" result would be a "proof of our future."
In a poll published on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, a turnout must be 50 percent and then a vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores the entire Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sealed Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero looked easy on the game with his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He made his debut between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open field.
Then, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green dresses.
He forced a defender ahead on the run a few more at the end of Brighton's box.
Then, he pushes to pass to his left and finds Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who in turn used his right foot to overtake Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a kick on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is having some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the opening advantage in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while deep into Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a good through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net before slipping out of bounds.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler for the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff content, there was no reason to insist on another start.
But Scherzer's always-on defense hopes to secure a playoff spot on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but that's if the Rockies still have playoff implications with a game-winning advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At any rate, the Rockies secured a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to secure their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, we'll be able to step into the mound, somehow, knowing that the feeling here in Denver, with the people and the other team, is possibly the highest level of any point I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are allegedly asking to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and to pitch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump, rallying in West Virginia
The President did not explicitly mention the situation surrounding his choice for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the outcome of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November is at stake.
It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm running really so I'm afraid to fight for the great candidates," he said.
Trump said, "You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to reclaim power by any means necessary, you see the depravity, the misery.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to tap into to get the power and control, power and control they want, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a mission of "contrary and deterrence."
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and deceitful and lying."
He mentioned the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranked member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received loud shouts from the public.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, no, I'm waiting for one - that ugly body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
It's not a big church anymore.
It no longer accepts those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum activists voted with my local party to denounce me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told we weren't welcome - all for expressing our thoughts.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censorship petition for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, which is ironically similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
The Nottingham East Labor meeting announced on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, such were the GC meetings on Friday nights.
Unfortunately today, this is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of "more understanding, gentler" politics, whether it really began at all.
It became even more remarkable that opposing views on the Labour party were not allowed and judged each opinion on whether it was acceptable to those above the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy became leader, as the associates I initially thought had the same political views with me that I had turned my back on and took positions I would never agree to - whether in national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's the next wave of social media abuse calling for deselection, criticizing the politics of the middle class, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not my only experience.
Indeed, I know I'm much luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm being directed to are politically inclined.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who face the increasing amount of sexist or racist abuse every day but never step back.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the politics of this era is how the levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour party should cultivate a culture of acceptance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every petition of "no confidence" or change of selection policies, the party becomes more narrow.
I've received a lot of advice over the last couple of years that encourages me to just bend over, not talk too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I wanted to do with my political career.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, aroused by the feeling of Thatcher's government's neglect to leave my comprehensive school classroom literally collapsing, I have tried to promote better public services for those most in need - whether as local councillors or government ministers.
I've never been in a position to hide my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To the petitioners on Friday, all I want to say is that, when the country plunges into a Brexit that will damage homes, livelihoods, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But, frankly, the one message I have is not in the Nottingham Momentum, if not in my human representatives, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of deselction or political expediency will stop me from acting in whatever I think is in the best interests of all of you.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The non-fatal Ayr climbs to the top
Even the last two tests deflected the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win the amazing and entertaining match of the day of the Tennent Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the unique non-standard side of the ten.
Ultimately, it was their unique defense, as their better take on chances, that brought home side and coach Peter Murchie every right to be happy.
"We've tested our games so far, and we're still not losing, so be happy I should be," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The good in Ayr, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo converted Ayr to the front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to score and score an unconverted try Jason Baggot.
Climo scored Ayr's lead on a penalty, before, just right at half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt reduced Baggot's conversion to just five points.
Then, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was released by the stretcher, and from restarting, Ayr attacked forward with Stafford McDowall's try being converted by Climo.
Yellow card was awarded to Ayr's standing captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the offensive force.
However, the home side bounced back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down on the back of advancing Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star, looks set for a new career in the food industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to move into the hospitality industry, after discovering he has been named director of a licensed dining company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-wrote and starred alongside his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last to run the show, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official listing, he was director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though the Scottish Sun's reporter indicated that Kiernan appeared to want to be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant trade."
'For us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval base wrapped in rigging in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a flag as blue as the sea.
The oceanic wetlands from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the saying: "To us is the sea according to law.
It is a duty to restore it."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile's defeat in a bloody 19th-century natural resources conflict - such as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again - remains vivid.
Those desires are at their highest possible level for several decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the World Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a sense of unity, a sense of security, and it hopes, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, filled with hopes that the tribunal in The Hague will heed Bolivia's request that - after decades of occasional talks - Chile is obliged to agree to give Bolivia free passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial run-off for re-election next year - also has a lot of things hinged on Monday's decision.
"We will soon be back in the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
Some critics, however, believe that the chances of the court ruling in favor of Bolivia are slim - and little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The case means "uncomplicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision just six months after the hearing of the final arguments, said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on global law.
And far from the progress of Bolivia's struggle, it may have been prevented in the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric weakened any remaining good will of the Chileans," he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
Ambassadors have not exchanged between the two countries since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the speed of the court's decision was unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of misunderstanding when both sides benefit," he said.
Calzadilla, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, has also denied the issue of naval power as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it is able to trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to continue the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy after a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said it was the "deepest dream" of North Korea to get on its knees by continuing to impose sanctions and the U.S.'s opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration as Pyongyang has not yet taken significant steps in reducing arms.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about phasing out weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of big headwear to soon be unveiled on a High Street near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the sun, don't look for anyone else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a set of uniquely large headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway, making the style set at Paris Fashion Week amazing.
Overwhelming hats have been circulating on Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's unique piece is a truly unique beige-colored hat decorated with a broad bird-shaped brim that surrounds the models' heads.
Other large ornaments include bright watermelons, a wizard hat and also a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head cold.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of weird masks that were perfect for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have upper lip and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
There is a creation similar to the scuba diving gear that includes snorkels and goggles, while there is another that looks like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue with this great fashion statement - you're in luck.
You'll be able to see the big bonnets on the high streets near you.
The arrival of the huge hat follows 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot-tall rim and was seen wearing everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely non-practical hat spread on social media sent yet again another big creation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw that is almost the size of a swimsuit model with its handle.
The burn orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied by a white leather handle, is the exclusive piece in Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I look forward to seeing the arrival of big hats and beach bags on the high street next summer – because of the size of the impression the designer has made, it’s hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.’
John Edward: Language skills that are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with the help of another body of excellent exam results, further bolstered by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen career and place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that designs and implements a school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and preferred topic of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we shouldn't just rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages earned a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored Higher A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also scored A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland sport foreign languages as essential skills that young people will no doubt need in the future.
Today's languages, as the subject of choice, are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that among the reasons employers provided for the difficulty of filling vacant positions, 17 percent were due to a lack of language ability.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Along with the increase in potential job opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have an advantage in the future due to having a lifelong ability like this.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically have the advantage because of its ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to communicate in a foreign language and only French was spoken in a double-digit percentage, which was 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's youth to invest in language teaching.
Developing multilingual skills, particularly in developing economies, will give young people a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools are different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK by the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there is always a choice of language in independent schools, with specialist teachers in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a teaching environment that will prepare young people and provide them with the skills needed to be successful, regardless of their future.
It is undeniable at this time, in the area of global business, that language knowledge remains essential for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be regarded as "the power of global interaction."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for fans looking to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers is nearing its end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"More than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James may have limited minutes to play.
Following practice in the early part of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump is set to launch a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including visiting allied areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits confirmation for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense over allegations of harassment alongside holding the Senate's expected confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of these rallies is to help the Republicans gain momentum in the upcoming November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week will focus on "moving volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their hold of a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control in Congress is very important for his agenda that the president is going to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaigning period," said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The rally is scheduled for tonight's Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and it can transport supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get reports from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help candidate for West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go to the president to try to get him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to keep hope going to Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may have needed this Ryder Cup.
The "swinging pendulum of momentum" is a completely invented concept in the field of sports but players believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They only had six points, and now there are only four, so maybe we have a little bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left.
In Europe the advantage is, of course, only four points and twelve more are left.
Americans, Speith says, think they have a little bit of a head and they're strong-willed, when it's because Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and had three points out of four.
Spieth led his side and aimed at him from tee to green.
The celebration's screams grew stronger as his round lasted, he entered an important putt to make the match four-legged after being two-down after two with Thomas.
He had the same set-up that beat them in the match at 15, the type of cry that says the fight is not over for the American side.
"You just have to be smart and think about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score higher than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable Ryder Cup story.
Four out of four and can't afford to make a strange but wonderful pair from Europe.
"Molliwood" is the only pair that didn't settle for a bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and back nines on Friday mornings.
That surge, and how their energy seems to flow from and into the noisy audience is proof that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and no more famous player can guarantee a win for the Europeans at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If it were possible, it would be at different angles.
However, it seems that the issue of Europeans winning is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb SImpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when Alex Noren paired them up.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine ambushed the Spaniard and Swede, and they were unable to get up any further.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's comforting to watch fourballs and foursomes closely because of the interactions between the pair, the advice they give and don't give, and the possible sudden change of strategy.
Europe played better as a group today and they were well on their way to the final day but this foursome session showed the resilience and strength of Team USA that some, especially the Stateside.
Europe has reached 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe are firmly into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of a four-ball and four-game match with just 10-6 against the United States.
The strong pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini led with two wins against struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side that included Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the American side who had won the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has won more than four times, and won two matches but could not lower the odds.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a superb weekend, only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they rallied together to defeat disillusioned Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in the 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who dragged himself into two matches on Saturday, showed short-lived surges of well-being but has already received losses in 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were ranked first and third in the world.
The weather was not good for Europe even though the weather was clear and windy in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They got a passionate 2<0x26>1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit into the singles, but as holders Furyk's side only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of being second in the standings, they did not seem to be able to cope with a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it's "unintentional" to disarm
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that their suspicions of the United States are deepening because of continued sanctions and that the country will never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives around the world that North Korea has taken "significant steps with good intentions" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear test sites, and vowing not to produce nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not seen an equivalent response from the United States," he said.
"While there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not really unilaterally disarm," he said.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of a "stage-long" denuclearization strategy in which North Korea will be honored as it takes small steps, his statement appeared to be important because it did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current President of the United States and the head of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to cut tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is pressing for denuclearization" and is raising the weight of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent manner, and they are also protesting "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions will bring us down is a strong dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued disengagement deepens our suspicions."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States head of state announced earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister announced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and the United States are not the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not lead to a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed greatly from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the territory of the United States of North Korea's rockets after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "really crush" North Korea, showered Kim with praise for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there is still much work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, and also said, "If it's going to last two years, three years or five months - there's no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honour Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue rigorously and unequivocally until we are fully informed about the eventual, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has jointly imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had taken place, only for North Korea to denounce him for making "gangster demands."
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missle site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures."
He said Kim mentioned to him the "equivalent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and the road to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students, take a course on getting enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the study's macho culture all night long while being powered by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university often know nothing about the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, teacher of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the earliest of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a question about the impact of sleep loss on learning.
‘After that, a woman came up to me and said: ‘Why didn’t you just say this to me, in my senior year?’
"She said no one told her about the value of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year the course explained to students the importance of having sound sleep habits and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as to overall health.
Paul Barreira, teacher of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a photo of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticism, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants were told how sleep deprivation increased the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a map of the campus, with interactive icons, that encourage participants to think about their daily activities.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - like you have a right to know the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are raising the problem of sleep deprivation.
Making sure you have enough sleep, of good quality, should serve as a ‘secret weapon' for students to fight stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he says - also to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, so they become constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class he had in his first year at Harvard.
He said his eyes were open and he had the inspiration to pursue a schooling course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students to complete a learning program similar to this one before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm when to sleep and wake up, and be aware of the adverse effects of the ‘blue light' worn by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocked down Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another disappointment after Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's side a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first win at the opposition's stadium since they won 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but it was Gary Holt's team that gave Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, to hang his side eight points against Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't look like the Rangers line-up missed the inspiration.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third and behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
And there may be even more problems waiting for Rangers then need to give a head injury solution to lineman Calum Spence after seemingly throwing something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to beat Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi 11 scored against Hearts last week and would have been happy with how his good group managed to keep their opponents out of each turn.
The Rangers were on top of the ball, but Livingston accomplished more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after two minutes as Menga's pass to Scott Pittman came close to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed a long shot.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow except for the force to grab the ball in the back post.
The Rangers took control but seemed to have a greater sense of confidence that their plan could be made in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick by a quarter of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers scored two goals in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to defeat Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's soft strike.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its introduction even though the opponent looked better, they couldn't be denied they deserved there due to just the graft.
The Rangers failed again to take action against the deep set-piece of the in-depth Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't move when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball through the slot onto Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted on the break when he substituted Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the substitution almost had a quick effect when the winger slotted Morelos, but the impressive Kelly quickly ran from his line for that interception.
But Livingston continues to torture visitors into playing the exact type of game they want, in which Lithgow and Halkett's long ball sweeps successively.
Holt's side could have made it even bigger in the final stages but McGregor managed to stop Jacobs well before Lithgow could go wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another last-ditch chase for a penalty because he and Jacobs were hooking up, but Thomson didn't look back.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and STILL YOURSELF...the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany who would one day become a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later transmit a device called the Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger Counter has also been a major supporter of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring the seemingly obscure cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He said, “What’s the matter?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used in reference to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity causes on minerals."
He said, "It's going to be a blast right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the name of the company continued to be associated with it.
The new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure involves the removal of immune cells in the patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory
They can then "determine" the protein that is common in most cancers and then inject it back into the body.
The vaccine provides good results for patients with various cancers.
For more than 18 months, the ovary cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect harmful cells.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory so that they "determine" the protein common to most cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results indicate that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
Similar methods of extracting immune cells from patients and "instructing" them on how to destroy cancer cells.
Kanye West joins Pro-Trump's Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Outing.
The result didn't go well
The "boo" shouted at Kanye West in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people many times and they say: 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I'm worried about racism, I should have left America a long time ago," she said.
The SNL began the show with a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Decision Committee on sexual exploitation complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted footage of West's criticism on social media.
It's not clear if the West is trying to make the West proud.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not stopped in the backstage about his hat.
"They put me in the back.
They said, ‘Don’t go out wearing ‘that hat’.
They've pissed me off!
And they said I was in the sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" when he said that, he did "I wear my own Superman suit, because that means, you can't dictate to me what I should do. You want the world to thrive?
Try to find love."
His comments caused the audience to boo at least twice and embarrassed the cast members of the SNL, according to Variety reports, and a local person said in the publication: "The whole studio was engulfed in silence."
West was introduced as a sought-after replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
Many were shocked by West's performance of the song I Love It, in which she dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: THANK YOU FOR BEING OTHER PEOPLE."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West was "just being superstitious and without a doubt amazing."
"But I choose NOT to recognize a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and expresses the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's got freedom.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and said he was now "the one formally credited as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has the name of former Snoop Lion and of course, the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name and turned it into a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been accused of being a victim of bullying.
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsman character Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, strongly criticized the stereotype of the brush defender, he said such roles on the screen lead to young men's frequent thinking that they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she "strongly" wanted to discuss the issue.
"My personal preference is strong right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television has a role to play in the rise of harmful masculinity due to its very tough characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of guy?
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?
There's definitely something wrong with the kids."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be making any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he said, 'he's done on the battlefields and on horseback'.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the rerun of Sam Shepard's True West story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently announced that he and his wife Rose knew what he considered the best thing to happen to Game of Thrones.
'I met my husband on the show ‘this, it's been the way I'm going to have a family in the future, and it's going to be my life out of it,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who starred Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two got married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> increase in number of new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases are passed on through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing to 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was ended in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is estimated in studies that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with a man eventually marry a woman.
Most infections in the disease are caused by a lack of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff has disseminated the data of GOP senators, and insists on "repeating lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators to the U.S. on Wikipedia pages for lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat's "ultra-right wing" scheme insisted that the complaints be classified and website.
"False lies, lies, and many more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the released information included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual immorality against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
It was only a few minutes before the three senators came to investigate Kavanaugh.
In the Hill report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState that linked Waters' office announced an IP address referring to the source of the posts and it provided Waters' staff member information.
"It's completely false and a lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - who compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these deceptive and false allegations - has nothing to do with the spread of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a lie."
Waters's remarks quickly gained traction online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There's anger at this refusal," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests he does not have the necessary behavior of a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be fighting.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and dignified."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' condemnation of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too sarcastic during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters from his seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
"It's hard to tell the truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had already alerted "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities regarding these fraudulent complaints.
"We will make sure to identify the people responsible," he continued, "and they will be held accountable by the law for all their activities that are damaging and endangering anyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - missing spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for merits for Brexit in any new film tilted towards Britain and it looks like it fits into the new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 in Johnny English and made noise again in 2011 in Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be a good idea to have a sense of humor about how much we're missing out on?
Despite all that, Johnny English's big-eyed, smug-looking no-flying look is licensed to kick things again for the second time - more than anything else, his name suggests he's a wide-ranging comic made for places where viewers don't speak English.
Of course, he's a crazy secret agent who despite his bizarre pretenses of being elegantly sloppy has a bit of Clouseau's character, with Mr. Bean and mixed in with the male portion who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire tune theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international mysterious man Atkinson had previously played in what has now been sent to Barclaycard's forgotten TV ads, where he caused trouble in his own right.
There are one or two beautiful scenes in this latest episode of JE.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and quickly hitting the rotor blades on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical humor can be seen, but the extreme humor has not been effective and natural, especially with the confidence that "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible will now add humor as its element.
There used to be a joke that it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's pulp comics weren't as creative and vivid as Atkinson's silent-movie gags on Bean's persona.
The current premise that has long been experienced in the area is that Great Britain is placed in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain's highly confidential web spy network, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents on the field, which has caused frustration with the agent in question - a depressing little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing to break the prime minister who is a proud and antagonistic person, who is already suffering from complete anxiety over the person's lack of political support for him: Emma Thompson reprised the performance of this hard-hitting-there character but doesn't have much to squeeze from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since all active spies had been compromised, he needed to return something from those who had retired.
And that’s referring to the school-going Johnny English himself, who now works as a head teacher at an exclusive institution, but gives private lessons on how to be an undercover operative: funny ‘to, because English provides a School of Rock-based spy academy.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with former long-suffering sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, having married a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Batman and Robin have returned to action in the aftermath of Her Majesty's Secret Service, and they encounter the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling prey to the lure of the charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer riots: the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough have begun their long adventures of false pretenses: pretending to be waiters, they start a fire in an expensive French restaurant; they make a scene to ride unnoticed on Volta's luxurious yacht; and English starts a massive riot when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset inside Volta's house to familiarize himself with Volta.
There is no doubt that all the endings in that final sequence will be fine, but even if it's entertaining and complex, there's a smattering of childish TV shows in its entirety.
Not much big stuff.
And I can't stop myself from thinking about other Johnny English films: wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to allow the British to work four days a week but that they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to have four days a week working for the British - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, they want the company's bosses to pass on those who have saved significant changes in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to return the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the country's workers was 'appropriate'.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed changing four days a week of work as a way to give workers opportunities in the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: 'Announcement of policy analysis is expected before the end of the year.
"This cannot be done overnight but four days a week working is an ideal adapted to the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the good of the workers and also for the overall approach to the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party had promised to work four days a week during its campaigning for the 2017 general election.
However, today the Labour Party does not endorse this goal as a whole.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "It's not the party's policy to work four days a week and the party doesn't take it into account."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour discussion to better explain his dream for a revolutionary economic socialism.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from "unsuccessful directors" and "people taking advantage of profits" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get the entirety of their stake because the Labour government may impose "reductions" for prudent misbehavior.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds that will provide 10 percent of the equity of companies in the private sector to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in "60 Minutes" if they could change their minds on the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh
With the FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett, the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court fell short for at least a week, and there was a question as to whether the department's findings would cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a "60 Minutes" interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could possibly find that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘this, after the accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you do this?’
He was determined, determined, and unafraid."
However, Graham's vote did not seem to change.
"I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and a big accusation will be needed for that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I do: Brett denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all of the people he's mentioned are aware of it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a massive star line-up that will perform and have a similar amazing mission; the end of world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by thousands of people who will gather at Central Park's Great Lawn not only to celebrate acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge of the true purpose of the event to end severe poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free event ticket (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers need to complete a set of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or anything meaningful to help spread knowledge about the purpose of ending the ordeal.
But how successful is the Global Citizen now that there is only 12 years left before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to attract people who encourage action or just adding it to so-called "clicktivism" - people feel they are able to make real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging a host of different causes.
These actions have helped encourage world leaders to advertise provisions and ensures the equivalent of more than <0x24>37 billion that will transform the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 funding and advertising proceeds from its actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of these have already been spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimates that insured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major providers include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based investor and executor partnership dedicated to "helping children grow up discovering their full potential," which promised to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after it received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice of nutrition shortages," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts of calls in the U.K. to focus on nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and youth through nutrition schemes.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "how do you think we can end so much poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like our predecessors who took large-scale action on civil rights and action against the policy of white-to-black separation, we will succeed, because we are stronger when together.

US may use Navy for "blocking the passage" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able "if necessary" to use its Navy to curb Russia's energy delivery to the market, as well as the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke said, from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's engagement with Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - was only a cover for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy broker like they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, using our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their exercise doesn't go to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to benefit and replace energy," he said, saying Russia has "only one thing to do" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These talks come as the Trump administration promotes the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to scrap the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said was the reason for Moscow becoming "in control" of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the current capacity of the pipeline to be 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unsatisfactory competition.
"I believe that we both have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to force consumers and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view from Germany drew a strong reaction, which reinforced its stance on the project.
Germany's top industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from interfering in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There's a big problem when other states intervene in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Thinking Good" by Elizabeth Warren on Running for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider" running for the presidency following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include a woman as president," she said.
"After November 6, I will really think about running for president."
Warren commended President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that "this country is taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm really deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our economy," he said.
Warren had previously spoken openly about his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's subordinates were not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of the population supported the move.
The poll showed more support for the run of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the possible run and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in connection with the possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would give an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin cited PTSD by Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq, after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"As my son goes through his return, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the feelings that our soldiers have on their return," he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a big problem not to talk about" and said that his son and other war veterans were "going back a bit different, they were getting used to the violence, asking if there was respect for anything given to the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every member of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, specifically female assault, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
18 states, D.C. supports questioning of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal questioning of a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support a person seeking asylum questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name was not disclosed in the case Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said he was abused by his partner "and his children," but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was stationed in Texas.
Lawyers for states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are sources of large numbers of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "regards decades of state, federal, and world law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition violates such principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Lawyers further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrant entry is detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the demand for labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for those who leave their home country out of persecution or fear that it is because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
Asylum is never meant to solve all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in rescue survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's often nerve-wracking," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
There is no shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up their wetsuits, trying to salvage anything they could see.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are already overflowing, being damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, suffered back and shoulder fractures, outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted how the massive earthquake felt in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he and his wife and daughter were staying.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in a falling wall there," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, then it was gone, silent.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid statement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. election has marked the beginning of what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war in which they exchange tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs in the first phase of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column on the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now tightening bullying by issuing propaganda advertisements in our own independent newspaper."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of free speech and free expression by issuing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in newspaper stores here in Beijing, you will find only limited dissenting voices and you will find no real picture of the divergent Chinese opinion about China's worrying economic direction, because the Chinese Communist Party holds a tight grip on the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers avoided the offer to publish" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans push away Women Voters Before Midterms in Kavanaugh-led Trouble, Analysts Warn
While many major Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that they will face strong reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions in this regard are very strong, and it is evident to most enrolled Republicans that they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be abandoned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) chasing backing enough for the FBI's investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - they can't forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the modern-day group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is near!" as they rallied in the Senate hallway because Republicans in control of the Committee on Justice chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unusual," said the news site of Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can go even further, especially among swing female voters in out-of-town areas and among young voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts said there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continued the confirmation.
"It's been a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether to seat Kavanaugh, it's also about the way Republicans handle this issue and how they treat him," explains Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be turning a blind eye to who to believe in the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with fewer taking the latter's side.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was certain or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or must have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after taking an oath last week that he had been abused by a drunk Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court nominee of showing him his penis while they were at a party while they were still at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a startup that aims to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the goal behind Inrupt was to "cover the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and all at once.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is that the user is completely in control of who will have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "self-empowering through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring in techniques, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to release a complete update where all of their business models will be completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this in the next web season," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy winner of the Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest military award in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "shiny symbol" to expose the stone 100 years after his grandfather's famous work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog while being bombarded with ammunition from field and machine guns."
Later, he went into the first row and led the line forward with "greatest bravery" before rushing with a field-gun and single-handedly knocking out the three of the team.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could not match but something humbling."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also presented a flower crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "an honor to be a part of the parade" and added that "the courage of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig did.
Think about it, you wake up all night to watch the iconic Bellator 206 but you're not allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six on the main card and is aired live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their presentation, UK viewers were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some of them were disappointed after they had to wait until the end of the day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter said the move to the boy cartoon "seems to be a bad joke."
"The government's policy was that at 6 a.m. it was inappropriate to watch such a show so they had to move to the kid show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would adjust their schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
"When I think about the replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, it's Monday.
But we fix it.
Believe me, when they moved there, there was a lot of repetitive text and all of them were angry.
We're trying to fix it, we thought technical glitch.
No, it has to do with the government.
I can promise that this won't happen next time.
"We're just going to play five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to accommodate the fans but we went too far.
It's just really a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Discretion' Over Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think about it until he reached secondary school that "it's not everyone's like him."
While speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne is selling, she said she spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that his desire to win the Olympics was less than his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular inmate on the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for months due to illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less inferior" to others as he grew up because "it's not easy to socially accept liking both men and women."
She said: "Until now, those feelings that I'm inferior, and that I feel different, are the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "different," she said, so she didn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality later.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics has become a high-profile campaigner for LGBT and used her exit at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to turn their homosexuality into a crime.
He said he spoke out because he felt he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that loving a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise to me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When you're going through a lot at a young age" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find a peer who has experienced both happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the only thing that matters is, 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he liked the front seat.
"I can't tell him you're not coming to sit in front of him," he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and it was only then that she really didn't breathe and she died that I really accepted that she wasn't touching," he said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for her first song of choice - Heather Small's Proud - which echoed her at the upcoming Olympics and still built her fur.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays and 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won't be in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to adjust his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as is often the case with him for the United States, the five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and practicing in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Since he had never been the most direct driver even during the height of his career, the 48-year-old was not suited for the cramped Le Golf National course, where the wrong shots were often problematic during the long rough.
And it seems that the tough course is still not enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's 9th match, to the target of British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who have fallen by four points starting in 12 singles matches, start warm-up, Mickelson's fight may be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, tapped me in the back and pointed at me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I wanted more, but that’s what happened and ‘that’s what we thought we were going to do.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup race that never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven boards, although Furyk said his presence brought some unseen benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke with people, and he's a good fit in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed him, this week, and it was fun to see.
He's given more than a game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows he's about to lose the big one
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that it's easy to lose a sizable one in the final day singles in the Ryder Cup and it can be an uncomfortable battle.
The Danish began the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain held the Americans' five-point lead but narrowly missed the finish line because the margin was very small, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that we're just big at Valderrama; we're just big at Brookline, and we lost there, and at Valderrama, we won, but we're almost there," Bjorn said, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to take the lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over yet.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until you put the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will remain.
I've said before, I'm going to focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Delighted by his players' performance on the tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
There will be another sequel tomorrow.
You can see the individual performance, and other activities.”
It's good to go out there with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone there, your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you need to get the players to understand, to release all you can tomorrow.
You're going to have to leave your partner and he's going to have to go out and get the best out of you."
Compared to Bjorn, the opposing number Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing when Europe displayed "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the ‘that’ bubble goes in one direction, it brings a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're pulling out the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the award game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"This is how I made the order of this group of players because I think it was the best until the end," Bjorn told his selections for singles.
Germany's new warship has been postponed
Germany's latest 2014 frigate should have been commissioned to replace obsolete warships dating back to the Cold War era, but it will not take place until next year due to system flaws and rising costs, local media reported.
The appointment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be included in the Navy in 2014, but the big project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They obviously have powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which are said to enable Germany to show power overseas - will be obsolete when the time comes for them to enter service, Die Zeit said.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited some "defects of essential software and hardware" that would have rendered the warship useless if it had been deployed on a combat mission.
Software shortages are especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship is overloaded which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same ship types used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the latest frigates have become increasingly important because of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of Germany's parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "running out of ships that could still be deployed."
The official said the issue has grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no replacement ships were provided.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had joined the Navy.
National Trust detects the secret life of bats
New research conducted outside an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
This is expected to shed light on the behavior of exotic flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis on all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and which species make which sounds.
Next, a habitat map will be created to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes to reveal the results of which habitat areas are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to learn about the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of fields and what is the best way to conserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened from construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated by building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in the path they are crossing.
Bats are important to the NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land nationwide.
It has trained experts, regularly conducting surveys, inspecting nests and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established the first and only dedicated land reserve for bats in Scotland on the Threave estate at Dumfries and Galloway, which was home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best territory for them.
"We have a good spot for the bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the beautiful residences.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and in other properties can help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of inspecting bats before carrying out maintenance within the property because it is possible that accidental destruction of at least one mother's nest could kill 400 women and young bats, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Scotland-based Bat Conservation Trust official Elisabeth Ferrell is encouraging the public to help.
He said: "We can learn more about our bats and we don't know the population of many of our species."
Ronaldo ignored rape charges as lawyers prepare to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news," saying there are people who "want to shine themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is fake news right now," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
Normal ‘yan.
They want to know my name, but that’s my job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would pursue compensation for "moral damages at a cost equal to the weight of the intrusion, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was frustrated by "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but both of them preferred it.
Mayorga also said he went to the police and photographed his wounds in a hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement because "he was afraid of retaliation" and feared "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old says he now seeks to reverse the arrangement because he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
It was close to when Ronaldo joined Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK's 'life after death' regrets the loss of automakers
The UK will "lively regret" if it loses its position as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement it would temporarily split production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of the border delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year and 90<0x25> of them were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have released their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how trade will work across borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could cause delays and a shortage of shares.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "well-arranged to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow not only to enjoy success at the moment but for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Based on evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to be able to fully resume any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota couldn't say how long production would last, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's ability to compete and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said that his members' concerns are growing: "In my experience, once lost, these jobs can never be restored.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a proper and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's landmark meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed another week" as the problem with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and possible presidential obstruction of justice.
Trump has been talking for months about whether to resign from the deputy attorney general, and whether Mueller's independence would be threatened.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wire to record their conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" suspend Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid a conflict with a judicial committee in the Senate where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set for that, perhaps this week, it may be postponed another week because of all the other things going on in the supreme court.
We will continue to monitor and monitor the situation."
Some reporters would object to his statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at While House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a dislike for the TV reporters' "failure", though he said: "I'm not opposed to the fact that they're really fuzzy."
Later, he indicated that there would be more direct ties between Trump and the press.
"The president is doing more Q<0x26>A sessions than his predecessors," he said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We're going to look at these numbers."
There would be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States themselves, it would be better ‘than' to talk to me."
We try to do that a lot and you see we've done it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by showing an informality and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU staff working with Scotland's NHS to express gratitude and wish they were able to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter now with less than six months remaining until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has promised to meet the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "Over the past summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued about leaving, hoping to make decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government is also stressing its preparations for a possible lack of agreement.
I know it's a troubling time for all of you.
So I want to repeat today how important each person's contribution is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that reinforce and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and fell over there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainers and sideline medical personnel before he was placed on stretcher and brought in for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/restriction of the damage" and Tennessee State is trying to determine where the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers of property in the UK will be charged with higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and will use the extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
The move counters the success of Corbyn's will to attract young voters
Stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the UK
U.S. Treasury expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreigners are set to charge higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and to use the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an antidote to Jeremy Corbyn's desire to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and target those who make a lot of money.
Stamp duty increases will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to support the Government's goal of resolving street sleep.
The surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary residences and in houses purchased for lease - could be increased by three percent.
The company expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new-made properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices making it harder for buyers to buy a home for the first time.
Many wealthy places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because many foreigners buy out of the country most of the time.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp duty to help younger adults buy their first home.
He blamed large construction companies for continuing high property prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to set aside quotas on affordable houses to fix "embarrassing housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending evictions "for no reason".
He also wanted to give the council greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to reviving the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
This means that there is a problem with the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
However, it is not right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy homes like hardworking British residents.
Too many people have dreamt of owning a home, and the indigestion of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition above all is to govern Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ambition above all" is to become Scotland's manager when the day comes.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that ‘that'," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportound.
"But I grew up always watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was always something like calling me back.
So, that opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has no fear of following such well-known names at such a large club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to take it there, but I'll probably just consider myself a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross is just three years into his managerial career, having been an assistant boss at Dumbarton and been part of Hearts' coaching staff for 15 months.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from a third-tier slump, and converted St Mirren from a narrow slump to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than ever when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a good idea," he recalls in reference to the squeaky wheel.
"I really believe that management suits me, more than playing.
It's funny because I've been playing a lot of games, I've been enjoying myself, and I've had a lot of fun.
But it was difficult to play.
You have a lot of things to do every week.
I’m still going through that when it comes to stress and pressure at work but the management is just right.
I've always wanted to be in charge and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling to myself throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, 5:30pm Saturday is the best time for a pint
The very hot summer has increased the sales of poor pubs in Britain but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars rose sales by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued rise in the sun and the longer England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed what happened in June, when pub sales rose 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered even more.
A decrease of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars have the strongest sales to drink the main commodity, and by comparing the two seasons, they have raised more than restaurants have lowered.
Summer also does not have a good effect on pub food staples, although it is not as bad as the restaurant operators.
People just want to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales dropped by three percent."
RSM's Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analysts said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or athletic events remain the biggest factors affecting the market sales of those outside their homes.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants are still struggling, and the drop in sales by 4.8 percent per year will be even more painful when it is added to the ongoing pressure of expenses.
Long hot summers are not good timing for food operators and only weather can tell if the situation will improve with the arrival of the colder temperatures we experienced in August."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in the release of brands.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they don't tell their parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - have secret social media accounts they don't tell their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears of sexual content postings.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account displayed to parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - create social media accounts they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth of "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has intensified fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "primary" account displayed to parents, while they also had private accounts.
A mother who accidentally sees her 13-year-old son's secret site meets a teenager who encourages other people to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are lured into creating internet spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government branch.
Doyle is Scotland's track and field athlete with the most wins and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a good opportunity for game guides to benefit from his extensive experience at a global level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect in the sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from taking him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta with his total of four golds at the Olympics and is now a regular expert at the BBC, will not be able to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
It was hard work but I fully recovered, learned how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be agile!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Be wary of internet opinion on advertising for breast pumps where mothers compare to cattle
The breast pump company has split opinion on the internet because of the advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cows.
To mark the launch of what they say is "the world's first silently worn breast pump," the company Elvie has released a hilariously sarcastic music video advertising to showcase the freedom the new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with lyrics such as: "Yes, I brush myself but you won't find a tail" and "If you haven't noticed I haven't chewed those, I have breasts".
The chorus continues: "Choose, squeeze, I'll milk the babies, squeeze, squeeze, I'll milk my boobs."
The announcement, which has since been posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it overwhelms the "terrible" dairy industry.
"It's not a good decision to sell the product.
Just like we need them to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, so their offspring are only a few days away after birth," says one.

Another commented: "First-hand traumatic for mother and baby.
"Why don't they use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who are not far from their babies?"
Another added: "There is no advertising.
While the song was being released, one of the girls admitted that the song "was funny" to her.
"It was an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I had a baby.
I felt like I could really feel a tingling sensation.
It's also a bit of a blur, but I think it's true.
"It's a product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their travesties or cubes) and feel like "cows."
It's not advertising that compliments or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women will reveal that they are all dancing with invisible pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bra unnoticed, so the more moving the women are, the easier they can hold their babies, and even manage to get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD told Mother: "The Elvie Pump has brought so much change that it should give it a bold and stimulating launch.
In contrast to pumping women and cattle we like to draw attention to pumping milk and all the hard stuff about it, while showing in a comforting and first-hand way the great comfort that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two-year-old children took to the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski to use the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of identified migrant children has risen despite the steady monthly crossing of the border, partly because it has made it harder for children to be placed on sponsors as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration.
Typically, most sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to put their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individual sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
"We're still trying to get people involved," Mr. Alvin said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials have implemented new rules that will require them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm, according to shelter workers.
Many will face off via video conference call, rather than in person, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Decisions that do not qualify for help are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or lonely, which can lead to severe irritants or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Supporters said those concerns were more intense in a larger Tornillo-like facility, where signs of difficulty in a child were less likely to be noticed, due to their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare for their emotions or to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma that many already suffer.
U.S., France and Turkey's 'invading forces' told Syria to leave immediately
While speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said it was illegal for foreign forces to remain on Syrian soil, citing counter-terrorism, and "to be dealt with as appropriate."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have had to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "contend the sacred conflict until both terrorist groups are expelled from all Syrian territory" and "any foreign presence that is illegal."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country suffering from war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were well for them to return, and he blamed "a few western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We have already called on the global community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're making a political point."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity to resume political talks.
With the agreement between Russia and Turkey, large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces have been avoided in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear margins" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who are "extinct."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members to write the constitution after the war for Syria and to allow elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers might expect, if his presidency ends prematurely with ouster and scandal.
In a no doubt "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Today, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'She's making me laugh,' " Ms. Scovell told me.
The chaos is staggering.
Of course, unlike others on TV, stories originating in Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families are reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Not listening is a luxury that only the richest viewers can afford.
But it's beyond being a smart citizen when you've spent six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," on Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket made of ostrich skin, "a smudge-painted suit," says The Washington Post.
If I were you, I'd have to say Super Mario.
"Part of what he's doing so it looks like a reality show is because he's serving you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's rotating cast of shows and the daily twist to the story (fighting with N.F.L.

You'll be left with an epidural.
When I approached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN recorded.
He couldn't leave the show, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and hang the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing funny shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a good idea, but they were right."

Money from outside floods in Congress' most tense midterm elections
It's no surprise that cash is flooding in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to a change in congressional districts that resulted in two currently sitting contests for the same seat.
Pittsburg's recently re-elected district Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district, who is actually crowned with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that old districts were manipulating unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The battle for the new 17th initiated a campaign fund battle between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a March special election that was watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican had held that post for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats very little.
U.S. imposes sanctions on El Salvador over support for China, then withdraws
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners ousted the ruling group of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to send American heads of diplomatic missions back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But only considering the sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include financial aid quotas and targeted visa restrictions, would have been too painful for the Central American nation and the high levels of unemployment and slaughter there.
As internal meetings progress, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow a similar one-year meeting seen as a step forward toward preventing migrant arrivals in the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they want the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new stern messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on condition that they not be named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside censor close to the administration and also spoke on condition that he not be named.
Let's study the history
What will happen next will be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence on the public record.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is now turning his investigation into whether Trump's campaign with Russia conspired to attack our elections.
If the holder changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility for this branch, as he prepares to re-elect, and will probably later face a jury composed of his counterparts.
There's a lot if that, and I'm not saying Mr. Trump's downfall - or his European counterparts - is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have a lot of decisions to make that will affect how long the rivalry will last.
In 1938, German officials prepared to stage a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next three years of murder.
The course of history revolves around such points of change of direction, and accelerates or delays the irresistible progress of democracy.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change today.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in control of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, last year, he had secretly proposed recording the president and even speculated that the president was not suitable for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How would we respond if the F.B.I.'s new inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or fair - or if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall into those trials, democracy's winter will be short-lived.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my home as ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit me the Sabbath candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Because of that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, following Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the season to a 2-2 board at Villarreal but he believed Rangers could use that result as a boost to bigger things.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came out with points.
We could have done it in the end, but overall, it would have been a good idea.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
It was a big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points but the game will be tough because they had a good result in their last game, but the people supported us, so I'm sure we'll fight back and get a positive result.
Last year was really difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a good feeling in the place now.
The staff was very friendly and the staff was very welcoming; the staff was very friendly.
We hope that we will be able to fight today, put aside the previous season and be successful."
Women's rights are threatened by fear of retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half the number of individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their wives about the value of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it can begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't say your wishes in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these decisions will be of great value.
Include your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or to insure yourself with your own money - if you have the money.
Correct your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a health care proxy so that you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your preferences in case you are unable to speak.
You should also consider having the power of attorney for your finances.
A trustworthy person will choose you to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid when you can't afford to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Explain those details in a written plan for you to be prepared.
"It's not just money, who are doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
You have to prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a casual act."
The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the lines of communication broke, officials of aid agencies from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake, were unable to obtain any information.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency with over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The 2017 regency has an estimated population of 299,200, which is an administrative region subordinate to the province.
Fishing and cultivation are the main economic resources of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, and killed nine.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died off the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of areas and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and fear because people remembered the devastation caused by the massive 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami followed this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake damaged thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists in temporary distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone from her.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is in custody based on a <0x24>500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, sure" when his defense was questioned, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and face a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanour, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of injuring his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the injuries.
The case is currently in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interference in reporting domestic violence, and armed robbery while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that Palin punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was praised by groups of veterans in 2016 after she linked her daughter's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude tsunami struck and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity was cut off and communication lines were disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showing the exact moment of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people were gathering at the beach in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for terror attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was said to have used a rental Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, plowing people on foot and cycling on his trail in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice about the intention to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to be punishable by the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed against Saipov with 22 defendants including eight charges of extortion support killings, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and accused of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of carrying it out as "dangerous, cruel and infamous."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused pain, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were hanged after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were hanged in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to Perfect.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He admitted no offence at 22 perfect.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the admission of sin for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma caused by these circumstances to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGEL FARGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today in protest at the Tory conference.
Ukip's former leader has said that what politicians need is to 'feel the pressure' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggests she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK "would have gone out by now" had Mr Farage been the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile her divided group is underscored by the Tories joining in favor of Staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep pace with his Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit Favors, those who want to Stay and the EU.
Allies have insisted that he will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the unfavorable reaction - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and the "disturbance."
Mr Bone told the Leave Means rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we have to throw out the Chequers.'
In releasing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We are not fighting world wars just to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone has dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 polls: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and they want to stay is not entirely true."
The Tory in Favor of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The general public doesn't like Chequers, the Opposition won't vote for them, our party and our activists don't want them to be the ones who walk the street and vote for us.
Please, please, forget the Chequers and start listening."
In an insinuating message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally would have to 'feel pressure' if they intended to abandon the decision made during the 2016 referendum.
"It's about now the trust between us - the people - and our politicians," he said.
'They're trying to give up Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not going to let you do that'.
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, who intend to back Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people in this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, self-governing, high-profile United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in Birmingham marched before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
There have been widespread activists waving Tory Versus Brexit flags after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis has taunted the Conservatives over security issues they suffered in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can put IT systems and all the technology for Canada and more, so that there is no border coalition, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
'It's just a joke.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'consider carefully' running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He is in the middle of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting in the jurisdictions using the town hall format since Trump took office.
One of his supporters asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and this includes a woman as president."
Man arrested after the death of Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La. announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting and murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dython Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got the bullet in the head that killed him," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defends his friend and Simpson shoots him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, armed with a handgun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is on his way to the world title after his team orders a win from Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes' team order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defensive position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to take over his teammates.
Vettel first stopped the pit and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have decided on the result.
Mercedes pressed a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead after a strike in which the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inside for free threatened to continue to defend after a double-move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh late on the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he led much of the race as he continued to run to target a quick finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually stopped pitting on the 44th lap but was unable to speed up his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job over the weekend and was really kind and generous to me.
"The team has done a very good job of getting one-two," Hamilton said.
It's really a bad thing to do."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "cruel and evil and lying".
"Something can happen and the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and evil and lying," he said.
When you look at them, they say, “I’m not going to do that.”
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who baptized?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who was baptized."
Wait a minute.
"We didn't... we didn't," he added, as he smirked.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had disclosed.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he asked."
But his earlier rejection of the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: “I tell you, it’s really bad body movement.
He probably didn’t, but “that’s the worst body movement I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the nominee in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who they can use to gain power," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned home to defeat the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two early goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored on the home side before Dwyer returned the Giants' only tackle.
Francois Bouchard scored the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals scored the victory.
It was the third third in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth time the Giants have won three games in a row.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford provided an assist as Beauvillier doubled just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan put the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's kickoff at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants the lead in the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side met again and Bouchard nailed them back with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee only one for the first time in the game late in the second period and he secured the win in his team's fifth half until the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will go home and head to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies as Hundreds of Airplanes Survive Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been called a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks have continued to rock the area and many have been caught in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' evacuation to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu airport.
He took leave to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the moment, could fly safely.
He then jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had to take a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number is still rising because many more bodies are under the rubble while others are out of reach," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to six metres have destroyed the Palu which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Small shops are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is working hard in Indonesia to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every evacuation task.
Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the early part of this year by Lombok earthquakes in which more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crashes into a lake
The airline operating the plane crashed into the Pacific lake in Micronesia today claiming that one man was missing, after it was first claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a male passenger was not found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and personnel after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they are all in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
“That’s a really good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk in the water up to the waist to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and screaming, and that he sustained minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said it also helped rescue sailors who had been repairing a port nearby by using a steamboat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered with PNG in the past two decades but no Air Niugini has been involved.
An analysis of a woman's life after a fire
The prosecution ended its argument on Saturday in a retrial to a man accused of arson for the life of a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to pinpoint the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the eve of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis accompanying Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted earlier remarks by Tellis, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that the man's cellphone was that of Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville back then."
Another non-issue was Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
According to the reports, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information on his phone.
"She's ruined the girl in her life," said Hale.
The defense is set to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Three hip hop groups want to challenge the negative perception of the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, based in Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and responding to social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and shine the conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are resurgent in the UK by artists such as Think and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
A woman in New York sued her husband for quitting her job after a "racist" text
A nurse in New York has sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongful text from the mother complaining that she was "black again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and compared the lawsuit to "stealth."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black man when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"I'm not going anywhere," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to her husband.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "assassinated" Ms. Maurice, saying that their former babysitter, an African-American, had done a poor job, and that what she expected was a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal, and is asking for <0x24>350 a day for a six-month, stay-in job he could have done, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's discrimination."
The couple, on the other hand, retaliated on charges of being racist, saying that Maurice's dismissal from the job was justified, fearing that they could not trust him after they hurt his feelings.
"My husband sent me a text that he didn't really mean to say.
He's not racist.
"We're not racists," his wife, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"Would you trust your children with someone you care about, even if they don't mean it?
Your new-born baby?
Not “No.”
While comparing the lawsuit to "persecution," Plasco said that just two months after her husband's birth and was "very hard on the situation."
"You want to kill someone like that?
“It’s not that bad,” the investment banker added.
As the case continued, the public quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't like talking bear, reveal new letter
Said of Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's great to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Still confident even after rejecting his work, he said of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from the little toy bear who wrote the children's book, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
He described Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that his father was proud of the eventual success.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not arrogant," she said.
"But because Paddington is real to him, it seems like your child is achieving something: you're proud of them even if you're not the one who did it.
I think this is how he views Paddington's success.
Although it was created by him and his imagination, he then gives credit to Paddington himself."
I said goodbye on the phone when my son died.
Her son was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"Nad called to say that it was really bad, that there was no hope for her to live," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
“And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I'll be there soon.
We'll be with you.
His body is slowly losing its effectiveness and the drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart pumping.
He said, “It’s all downhill.
I couldn't help but sit there and wait, as I knew all this was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because there were so many people around me.
I had to stop everything."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning her son's death, was on board with the other passengers - unaware of his passing.
"No one knows," he said.
"I was just crying, not crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt so sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know she loves the baby."
Women's rights to wear face coverings to protect themselves
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on the Welsh bridge cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son is hoping to become a chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile was good."
So, he left the job before he died, because "he was very sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it's going to have an impact."
Ms Davis made the cards, "to tell people there's something to go and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
"Don't be quiet, you need to talk to someone."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies's for several years, was left by Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
She was sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents she didn't stay with them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to accept it: "It's really a huge loss to the family.
We were confused.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The next day Brett Kavanaugh suspended as the FBI began the investigation
"I thought, if we could do anything as he demanded - an investigation on a limited time, limited scope - there would be at least a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "disrupted" amid the party's hardening.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for this is because of all the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans don't succeed, they'll be too weak in their attempts to elect their preferred person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the Senators, addressing them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and through it he met his wife Ashley, who was then Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the polling board and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors "down" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there had been 1,127 defects last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human smuggling charges were a big deal.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The majority of North Korean defectors were later offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
In recent months relations between the North and the South have improved considerably - which are in fact still enemies.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks focused on delayed negotiations on denuclearisation.
This comes after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed on general terms for a deal to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we would never be able to disarm first," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy," unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority Leader of the Lower House of Congress Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy" and said that because of her behavior she was not eligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would say 'too noisy,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming on several occasions and crying while discussing his family and his high school years.
Because he also condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "blasphemous and co-ordinated defamation" that liberals orchestrated in Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed she was not in favor of the Democrats.
"I think he qualified himself with those statements and the way he denounced the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if he could be confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the Lower House.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he's not worthy of not only the Supreme Court, but also the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not the time for a noisy and well-meaning person to come to court and hopefully we'll say, 'Isn't that pretty ‘that,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Must Use It.
It is a logical denunciation, overflowing with months and years of anger, and he cannot bring it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I think that’s normal, isn’t it?”
She continued, "A local executive woman helped me a lot, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she made the point that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You think I'm probably sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he continued.
I think that’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a way of expressing anger because they are misunderstood in the first place.
One of my most vivid memories from my previous jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I was crying with unrelenting anger, was grabbing me by the collar of an older woman - an angry manager I was always afraid of - and pulling me onto a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy you're crying."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on his wife inside a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for him not to consider running for the presidency himself.
“It’s not really a well thought out decision ‘that’,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another one.
One person called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had long since begun, he was left out of fundraising, so he promised not to participate in the fight unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
“There is no such thing as a ‘dream’.
He found that some of his supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to the men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think they're going to give me a discount?" he asked.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was filled with emotion - thanks to the people who supported her, disillusioned with the system where it was very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at gender discrimination - so she cried.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was sponsoring me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"Is he crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war will benefit Beijing
The initial outbreaks of the trade war between the US and China are deafening, and although the conflict is far from over, Beijing may well benefit the long-term rift between the countries, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued the first warning earlier this year by levying taxes on China's major exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week entered the biggest increase in new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which in fact taxed half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliates each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to stick to the U.S. in every move, and is unlikely to close the world's second-largest economy in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, it would have to give up on demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be an embarrassment to <0x58>i Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing behaves well, the U.S.'s long-term trade war pressures will be positive for China by lowering the level of interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic integration in either of the two countries, is far more dangerous than observers have admitted before," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in the country's resurgence that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation is now more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to work on rehabilitation in areas devastated by terrorists to restore everything to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the regime is open to Syria with the help of the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have supported the revolution.
The Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now won six consecutive defeats in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The tee-shot of US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, crashed into the water in the par-3 16th hole, and he conceded the defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone in all of his rounds, becoming a 1-in-4 player with a 5-0-0 since the tournanent's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who may have been in his final Ryder Cup game.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful of all time in his 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but now I can't stop.
This man has become difficult.
So I'm thankful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following the success in Europe.
He passed the role to his compatriot John Ram who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods by 2<0x26>1 in a singles game on Sunday.
"I'm really proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
There was a moment this morning that we had a bit of a hard time with Europe.
We fought.
I asked Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
Together again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I've loved these 12 years and I'm honored to serve as captain.
You're really saluting.
They're just better."
