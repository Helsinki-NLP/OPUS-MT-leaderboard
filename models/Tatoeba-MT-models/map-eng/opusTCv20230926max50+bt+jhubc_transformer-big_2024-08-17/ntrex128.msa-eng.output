The Welsh Council (AM) is concerned about "looking like a doll"
There is concern among some AMs over their title proposal should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It came about because of a plan to change the name of the conference to the Welsh Parliament.
I'm concerned that the entire political spectrum is going to get a kick out of it.
An AM from the Labour Party said his party cares ‘it rhymes with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘unclean.'
AM of Plaid said his party as a whole was "unhappy" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open minded" about the name change, but said it was a brief oral jump from the MWP to the Dolls.
In this context, the letter ‘w' in Welsh is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter ‘u.'
The Council Commission, which is drafting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any matter referred to by the Council members must be a matter of concern to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorizes the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on a proposal that had wide support for calling the council the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the AM title, the Commission favored Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AM appears to be proposing an alternative, but is having trouble reaching an agreement and could brighten the head of Honorary Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on change within weeks.
The law on reform includes other changes according to the way the council works, including regulations on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
I'll have a final vote on what to call when they debate the law.
Macedonia held a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership offers for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price to pay to join the EU and NATO union.
St. Martin's bells are silent because the churches in Harlem
“The parents I met said, historically, there are bars and churches on every street corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"They're both gone today."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are social in different ways now," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he feared money from asset sales would not last as long as leaders expect it, "and sooner or later they'll get back to where they started."
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums occupied by people who do not want to help maintain the sanctuary that still exists in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will have these churches closed altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these condominiums will be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had been worshipping nearby had taken possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by blacks under the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, that opposed hiring or promoting blacks at work.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the bells of the tower.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the bell of the tower a ‘poor people bell.'
Experts who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural treasures' and ‘historical instruments that cannot be replaced.'
Experts, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played out in St Martin over the past few months has become a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestri Room - the governing body of the congregation, made up of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with concern the bishop "will seek to approve the costs" for the vestry space, even though the vestry space was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the church complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's part.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for coral shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for coral shrimp in California on the opening day of the reef shrimp season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch the coral shrimp, but he "realized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I've got to bite!"
His entire collarbone has been torn and opened," Hammel said as he noticed when he got the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed to be a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty-style space in a department store run by an expert assistant.
As part of the effort to enter the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home appliances return, the larger beauty space will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and brought to more buildings next year if it comes to fruition.
Investing in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use shelf space that was once claimed for TV, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
A range of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching various Boutique make-up products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by buyers from young people.
Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and turning towards buying a little food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket has to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the branch would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl's big business with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several venues since it bought the two chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous supermarkets wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boot in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after disagreements over how to split revenue from a pharmacy store in its market.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmaceuticals chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the show, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and appearance in our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with friends who are specially trained to be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and comfortable location means we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'bewildered' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, 'beaver' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for household items and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that he would quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, outraged by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand business in the final moments - to focus on her new extraordinary contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "overwhelming" as the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote to home goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truely, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Over the years, it has been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that will see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of items at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter This Morning, which is one of the most acceptable stars at the bank in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and the potential to delay its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40<0x25> stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer in the program I'm A Celebrity'.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism the news media would receive for commenting that would in part consider ‘unreasonable to the president' and was very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by persuading the voice of “newsreaders.”
“I never give up.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been crowned by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But negotiations over the nuclear program have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "a similar response" from the United States about North Korea's initial armistice movement.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Our relations are good with North Korea," he said.
"We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing the remains of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Kill Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for international assistance.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging," Ms. Subung said.
While Save the Children together in a team went to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign personnel could work at the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquakes that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal areas.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although the warnings have come into force, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between islands in Indonesia is indeed challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat quake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a top priority in his election campaign, and he has made high allocations on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has plagued Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi is facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have received a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalised against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his side leading 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards the away goal net.
The attempt soared high over the goal as it drifted towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I try to slow down as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a kick and didn't think much and then take a shot."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after netting in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before hovering in the middle of the pitch and running into central Liverpool.
Kovacic gives and sends can be quickly in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into goal.
The danger passed the defence and scored away with a left-footed kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of a building that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the collapsed building.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been carried out after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stabbings at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera futej to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said the investigation is ongoing, they are in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He's a little nervous when he finds out what's going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He kept repeating "it was so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers standing inside the cordon monitored the block of the apartment.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue to be the latest memorial hit by 'rewrite history'
His removal would be a poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction with so many English artefacts and religions perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the present debate of the removal of the statues of which the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not directed or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's ancestors in the last century.
The beautiful representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in the situation of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full-fledged representation has been the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure representing a divided part.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and commemorated."
Pigs beat Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with severed arteries, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig's door next to open.
He said in a pig pen was a large male pig with a bloody mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had beaten farmers to death, according to the report.
"His family" Wu, said, as quoted by the Evening News Guiyang.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40am Thursday morning to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that pigs had been locked in order to prevent them from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly in talks for compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not always aggressive but the taste of blood could act as a "trigger."
They're just messing around.
They're nippers, so curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay with the right amount of respect," he said.
Excess Hurricane Rosa Brings Widespread Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved into cold water waters off Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains in northern Mexico and southwestern the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to reject the tropics northward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacts with approaching troughs that create heavy rain in the Southwest the following day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flow of debris and landslides likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern part, especially more than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in severe conditions due to tropical rain distributions.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons for rivers to shake and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust to blow.
The nearing trough will bring heavy rain on the southern California coast.
Rainfall amounts of more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to the flow of small debris and slippery streets.
This is the first rain in the region during the dry season.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain gets further into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and lastly on Wednesday.
In October you can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain slightly warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-range temperatures.
There is a great example of the temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer lingers will try to build and grow again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of being sexually assaulted allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touches: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping him and trying to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said it was 100 percent certain that it would not happen.
It was probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, that's the size of an audience equal to a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which thinks the host has supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured as a CNN and CBS cameraman on Friday morning shouted by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood with his disabled eye for a few minutes as he preached, airing live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when many women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would say a lot at the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hours directly later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against the nominees next week, minority democrats urged.
Flake is confident part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After the Coons and several senators' conversations afterwards, Flake made a decision.
This choice of Flake does have power, as it is clear Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU's reserves should collect tariffs each "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police detain suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on two-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video about the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted that Wayde shot him dead physically.
His bond has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Lawyers report.
East Baton Rouge Coroner official issued a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department credits a team of Louisiana State Police poaching officers, state police crime labs, Southern University Police and local residents with assisting in the investigation leading up to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for “the persistence and effort of justice”.
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "wonderful" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano all the way to the southern region of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust for 24 hours.
The center monitors various earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of car windshield covered in a layer of ash in a residential area of Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan understanding followers ahead of voting independence anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization election.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police pelted them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds on the streets common to tourists.
The fight also took place later with the police using their wands to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" against unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protest, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for his eligibility to be independent, although the turnout percentage was low with those opposed to segregation largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting the country's police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expected Catalonia's prospects of independence.
“Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant run-up to a regional election victory in December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with their many well-known leaders either in exile or in custody to await trial for their role in organising a referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Fighting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after being hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after the same car rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossroad may have also fired a shot at the car at some point.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston earns victory
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts boss, who they will face with eight points on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the unbeaten run in this division to six matches, with head coach Holt still feeling defeated since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opposition.
Holt's team should have been far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing Rangers to face all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke it up but gave up his effort past goal, but Alan Lithgow could only give up his effort after sliding into Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they could give the opponent a problem with a set piece.
And that's the way in which important goals exist.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the blinds, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to set Menga, who took the touch and goal grid from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had taken possession but had found a home defence that couldn't break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely out of trouble.
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save for Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and continued to clear, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - bounced away.
'Fenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of play and their staff have hardly changed since returning to the top ranks, but a huge credit has been forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came in.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, embossing an orderly great defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
Rangers are less inspired, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall away from that standard.
The latter ball was rather short-handed - just once they cut the home team- and it was a call up for the Rangers, who found themselves at the mid table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a lot of applause in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a strong crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war protests depicted the happiness of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and dismissed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford highway accident: Biker dies in car collision
The cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident comes months after another cyclist died in a collision on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and in-place bus diversions and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disturbance
Six prison officials were injured in a disturbance at a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" Expert Officer was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight occupants and had one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been assigned to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to jail to deal with a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Floods
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind power tracks cross the Desert Southwest, risking flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood hours for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical cyclones have remained stormy or depressed status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain fall, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Desert Southwest including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with remote amounts up to maybe 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash floods, Rosa's rain may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, there are some that the downpour will benefit since the Southwest is now experiencing a state of drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experienced the worst drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, with a hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates downs.
Therefore, it is expected that the land will collapse in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be heavy, leading to the risk of major flooding.
"The amount of rain 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, so it may be 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or debris is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to result in life-threatening flash floods and the flow of debris in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officials are appealing to those who may have a mobile phone recording of what is happening to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "suffering, meaningless, angry" Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the cruel and outrageous tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered very badly, angry" the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted a decade ago during her teenage years.
Ford also testified to the hearing on his charges.
The TPresident said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawmaker with an outstanding record in the public service," he told the crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of the Republican election in the general election.
"In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place where I'm fighting for a great candidate."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and hinder."
The first major vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the GOP's senior advocacy leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for celebrations on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave slammed into the ground at dusk, wiping out many deaths and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and did not run and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster catchment agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it attacked everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before the blast on the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and were safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centres in Paluu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, a bridge turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storm continued to shake the city by the shore on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of a tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the devastation as “widespread” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and destruction may have been more devastating along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala.
"Communication is completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the tsunami occurred during a warning period.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man's voice on the building screams at people on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave hit the beach and pulled along with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a major power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo plane from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population still needs food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala were safe to reach the city of Palu, they went through the scene of the disaster. Workers took refuge under a tarpaulin cloth set up in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While aid teams began providing disaster relief in a bleak atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supply of material needs and the delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a disaster zone of the country.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster,' then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status anymore."
As the second night approached Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing victims hoped their loved ones would turn out to be a miracle and cheer them from feeling sad.
On Saturday, a child was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under a rock for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two people missing in the quake for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were the students, Mr Mandagi said.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how he was eager to send WhatsApp messages to paragliding participants in Palu who participated in the beach festival after several hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the paragliding community.
The message sent only has one gray-coloured rait mark compared to two blue-coloured rait marks.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
The thief stole <0x24>26,750 during ATM replenishment in Newport on the Levee
The thief stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who filled in cash at Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee vacated an ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employees were busy carrying out his duties, a man ‘runs towards his back' and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing his change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, called Ye for a while and she used the nickname as the title of her eighth album published in June.
The conversion took place during his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
“She replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled her appearance on the show over ‘emotional issues,’” the show’s creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said that the name has a religious meaning and is also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
“I believe ‘ye’ is a common word often found in the Bible and it means ‘you,’” Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you. I am also we. We are us.
It turns from Kanye which means only one, to Ye - an image of reflection of our good, our bad and our mistakes and everything.
The album is more than a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former partner, JAY-Z, can also receive it without or with punctuation marks and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military action against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary in retaliation for a bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO pledged at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to "never use force to hold back Mexicans."
The military opened fire on civilians who staged peaceful demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968 that left 300 civilians dead as left-leaning student movements began to march across Latin America.
AMLO pledges to support young Mexicans by subsidizing monthly to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to be involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence fund
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence because China is becoming increasingly active in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view comes after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence even though the U.S. itself is overall short of an official strategy of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year with the goal of becoming number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Predicting the allocation of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling funds can increase the chances of the next big achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China’s top companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best-ranked American Othello player while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology contests such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next contest would be held so that he could identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes on academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in academic institutions. It parallels the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds among U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that aims to bring together partners from industry and academies. The White House announced a lineup of Selected Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. bill trying to establish the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been carried out in recent months.
Macedonian people vote to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday to determine the name change to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia'. An action that will resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, insists that the name ‘Macedonia' represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonia's participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a name change proposal in June but the nationalist opposition said the conversion downplayed the ethnic Macedonian identity of which the majority of the population is Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the polls and that the vote cast doubt on whether the polls would reach the minimum 50 per cent of the votes needed for the polls to be valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to be a member of NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change included Prime Minister Zoran Zaev saying "The acceptance of the new name is a price worth joining the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Despite being illegal by law, MPs said they would abide by the vote's decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of anything not according to the rules happening until 1pm.
However, voter turnout was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 per cent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast a ballot in Macedonia for the country's name change that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride and not in this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's participation would provide adequate investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
I believe a large majority will accept because more than 80 per cent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the ‘yes' decision was ‘confirmation of our future.'
A vote was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies which said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the polls - below the required amount.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that as many as 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70<0x25> said they would vote yes.
For a poll to be successful, the number of voters coming in must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the polls would be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government policies since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire line of defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton's defenders at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received a delivery in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced between Brighton's three defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He turned down a defence before chasing a few more men on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he turned to the left, looking for Sterling.
The forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton area during the match.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards a distant position.
The Sky Blues forward punted the ball into the network before sliding out of bounds.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group play at 12:55 noon on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals team knocked out of a play-off feud, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a play-off implication for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies grabbed at least a special chance spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock in their first division champions.
"Even if we play alone, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams will play as well as possible at the highest level I will face this year.
Why don't I want to fight it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but reportedly tend to allow Scherzer to throw in the situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, holds a warm-up session on Thursday and will make a throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed thrower from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 hits right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia
The president did not directly refer to the situation surrounding the High Court's selection of Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to face the most important election in our lives.
I don't fight but I'm very competitive and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible Democratic radical group, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to reclaim power by using whatever means, you see cruelty, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to break to gain power and control. What they want is power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to ‘reject and barricade.’
“And you saw that for the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘angry, evil and untrue.’
He referred to the Justice Committee's Senator Dianne Feinstein's position by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Are you leaking documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer a large church.
It's not acceptable for anyone to express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I'm the latest in the Labour AP lineup to be told that we're not welcome - all for voicing our views
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she supported anti-Judaism.
In my case, the censure movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically the issue is almost the same as what Jeremy disagrees with the previous leader.
A meeting notice for Nottingham East's Labour party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that is all-encompassing and productive."
For almost eight years as a local Labor AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really included all of that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises of ‘better, softer' have long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that dissenting views are unacceptable in the Labour party and that every opinion will be judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague who before, I think shared almost the same political views starting to expect me to make a U-turn and take a position I wouldn't agree with - either on national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak outside - and no matter what I say - then it will be followed by condemnation for abuse on social media, told not to vote, denounced the political center, told me to quit the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
Yes, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues for commenting on me more politically.
I was impressed by the professional attitude and persistence of my colleagues who were showered with sexist and racist vows on a daily basis but never gave up.
One aspect of the political disillusionment of this era is how the rate of abuse has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a vast church and with every ‘no-confidence' proposal or change in election rules, the party is becoming increasingly narrow.
I received a lot of advice over the last two years urging me to be quiet, not too prominent and then I would ‘be good.'
But that’s not what I want to get into politics.
Ever since I joined Labor 32 years ago as a school student, raised by Thatcher's government neglect that let my entire class down, I've been trying to lead a better public service for those most in need - whether it's a local council member or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is likely to be confused about my position and the part of the contradiction with the current leadership.
To those who support Friday's motion, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will undermine our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leaders.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise unelected threats or political appropriateness doesn't prevent me from acting in what I believe is in the interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unrivaled Ayr climbs to the summit
Two slow attempts may have made the final decision skewed, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved a victory in this exciting and entertaining Tennent Premiership match.
They are now in the top spot in the table, the only one ever to lose to 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took chances, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We have been tested for our game so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson scored a try in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the grid and Jason Baggot caught a non-conversion attempt.
Climo led Ayr with a penalty, before, at half-time, he got a point then a solo conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at break time.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was brought out, and from the start, Ayr continued forward again through Stafford McDowall's try, a conversion by Climo.
Replacement captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose countered extra players with a Bruce Colvine unconverted try, at the end of a time of fierce pressure.
The home side returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's ballless tackle, from the outside line of the penalty, MacPherson slid behind hit the forward Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Star Still Game is seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran was seen ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, where he co-wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources cast a shadow that Kiernan wanted to get involved in ‘a thriving restaurant business.'
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked hope court will reopen passage to Pacific
Marine guard of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was calibrated with the motto: 'The ocean is actually ours.
Getting it back is a responsibility."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing shore to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like one yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope may be the highest in the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course wishes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be in favour of the Bolivian claim - after centuries of talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who is facing a controversial match for next year's re-election - is also of much interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a ruling on Bolivia's side - and if it does happen a little bit it will change very much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award the area to Chile, and has ruled that it will not determine the possible outcome of the talks.
On the ICJ's decision to come out only after six months of final arguments were heard indicating the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to slow down Bolivia’s policy again, for these four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold talks afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions are usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year rift for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to a direct passage into the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says a nuclear truce will not take place unless it believes the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not carry out their nuclear weapons first if it did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that came to a halt more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "just a dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang first making a crucial step toward a ceasefire.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons that is seen as the only way to ensure the security of its country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large headdress on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out the sun completely, then there's no need to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a range of bizarrely large-sized headdresses for their SS19 collection on a stage show that enchanted the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
An impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and this designer has sent their fanciful designs to the stage of the show.
A prominent design by Valentino is a great, water-yellow hat decorated with thick artificial feathers that wide cover the head of the model.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-decorated, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a strange choice of masks - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have been sewn on her lips and more resemble Hannibal Lecter than the elegant fashion.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkels and goggles, while the other looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the great fashion reality - you're in luck.
An observer of the style predicts that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The "La Bomba," a straw hat with a full two-foot width has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of the label behind the highly impractical hat has been displayed on social media sending another big design to the stage of the show - the straw beach bag is almost as big as the bathing suit he wears.
An orange rafia bag caught fire, decorated with rafia flanked and supplemented with white handles, which stand out in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - because the designers have made an enormous impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their preferred careers, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that they can and implement an earlier school curriculum, we see the modern language continues to be well-known and the subject of choice is desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that is understood, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will enter his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest pass rate in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get a higher grade A.
This data, gathered from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students earned a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language now, as a subject of choice, is being held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found reasons employers struggle to fill gaps, 17 percent associated with language skills shortages.
Because of that over and over again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring language, these skills are vital in this globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having this kind of lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country would put someone who mastered many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for a conversation, with French as the language of conversation being used by only two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the country's developing economy, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as essential to the UK when looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages to choose from within private schools, with instructors who specialize in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing an atmosphere of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
In today's global business environment, language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered an ‘international communication skill.'
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron will make his first Lakers appearance on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell predicted that James would probably play in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers' season.
"I don't need a pre-season game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has launched a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scheduled meetings next week, including a stop at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote held for him to vote to fill the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump is targeting to win support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET on this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to face trial this week for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense over the prosecution of sexual misconduct with confirmation of a Senate vote expected to be held for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this hasty rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
President Trump's campaign said five rallies next week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go as many states as possible in our country toward a busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. forces show courage to fight in ensuring hope is still on its way to a singles match on Sunday
After three one-sided matches, Saturday's corner game is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time around.
Swinging momentum is a sporting concept that is a creation but it is completely trusted by the player, and even more so in a match like this.
Where's the momentum right now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four-point advantage, so we brought a bit of momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth as he walked in at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has an advantage, four points ahead with twelve more points to grab.
American players, as Spieth put it, felt they had a bit of an advantage and a sense of being driven, not only from Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had three of the four eyes.
Spieth showcases a venomous game from scratch to the green area and serves as an example to other players.
The lively cheers grew louder as he continued to advance, taking an important swipe shot to match the four points when he and Thomas were left behind after two points.
His sleek shot that gave them victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own matches," Spieth said.
That's all there is to all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The pair of players are different in character from Europe but have a fondness for four points out of four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do bogies on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoid bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That period and the way their energy is given and shown by the supporters is proof they are players to beat on Sunday, and no player is more popular to block the possibility of a European victory during a sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
They're both in different holes.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, the four-man hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes made it difficult for the Spaniard and the Swedish player.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and led far on the last day but this four-day session also showed the U.S. side had the courage of many, including local fans.
European teams lead 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe took a comfortable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after recovering from a four-ball and four-man game with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both greats, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari are ahead with two wins over Tiger Woods who are struggling to take their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn sought to keep the trophy seized in Hazeltine two years ago, dominating a misguided American side in the morning four-ball session, with a 3-1 draw.
The U.S. team gave more competition in a four-player game, won two games, but could not bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari's so-called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and new American player Bryson Dechambeau in the 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who went through two tough games on Saturday, has shown some brilliance but has now lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play rest during the four-ball morning session, again teamed up with Henrik Stenson in a four-man match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2<0x26>1 - ranking first and third in the world.
Europe was unlucky on a quiet and relaxing day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the gauge wood for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a 2<0x26>1 win beating Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and then again beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4<0x26>3 match in a four-player game that was lost on two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder's Cup history have a four-point lead to a singles match, though as the defending champion Furyk only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, Sunday's counter-attack looked like it was beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's "impossible" they will voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have caused their deep distrust of the United States and that it is unlikely that its country will voluntarily relinquish nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear test sites and promising not to expand its use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, there is no way we would have been able to disarm them in the first place."
While Ri has complained to North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "phased" nuclear termination approach in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking a step back, the statement appears to be important as it does not reject voluntary denials as Pyongyang has in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to strive for a "nuclear end to the Korean peninsula" while Trump assured North Korea's security.
North Korea tried to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the recommendations to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "preliminary termination" and increases the level of pressure in sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes the "final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is an empty dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is the continued restrictions that are worsening our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister mentioned only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the parties to this termination issue are South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear termination of the Korean peninsula will not find a standoff."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed dramatically from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "evil Mr. President" named Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and that sanctions need to remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we feel a complete, final and confirmed nuclear end."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after which he had condemned him for making "gangster-like claims."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "same measures" that Kim was looking for were guarantees of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of its students more sleep in an effort to combat a learning culture that is becoming more and more so through the caffeine-based 'all-night'.
An instructor finds students at the world's number one university often can't understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only told about this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help academic performance and exercise, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students had been sleep deprived for the week.
The one-hour course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a dormitory room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, the participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride in ‘staying up all night’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing stress on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Making sure you have enough quality sleep, it should be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course, having taken his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before as well as after sleep, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat at home when Dolly Menga's network tied Steven Gerrard's weak side with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side are still looking for their first win at home since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
On the pitch in the seventh minute before half-time and the Rangers seemed to have no idea to equalise.
With Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and were just behind Hibernian with goal difference.
And Rangers may be in trouble again after the line-up, Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after being thrown an object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team which reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept the same Livi 11 team that stole one point from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his side play worried their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston scored more tries on goal.
They should have scored just two minutes later when Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
A free-kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defenceman Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained only hope for the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed two tries in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily deflected Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be counter to the pace of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers again failed to face the Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher slid the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made the switch during break time by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate effect when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the impressive Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long-distance deliveries for the sake of long-distance deliveries.
Holt's side were supposed to widen the gap in the finals but McGregor held on well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's header went from goal to goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty kick as he clashed with Jacobs but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: The Creator of Geiger
And now, the page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and UNDERSTANDING... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Calculator.
As the main basis of science since then, the Geiger Counter became the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unidentified scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in minerals."
"Yeah, it sounds like it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the name of the creature that carries its name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The method involved is extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
It can 'see' proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then be re-injected.
Experimental vaccines show positive results for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovering from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating this type of leukemia.
Kanye West Joins Pro-Trump, Wears a MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance
It's not well received.
Kanye West was teased in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a spectacular performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be competing in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town in which he wore a ‘Make America Great’ hat, he continued to fight Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Many times I've asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star parodied Brett Kavanaugh's confession in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to make fun of West with that post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has been having a hard time backstage about his hat.
"They beat me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're bullying me!
Then they said, "I'm in an insignificant place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to look at that insignificant position?" saying that he's going to "wear my Superman coat, because it means you can't direct me.
Try the love."
His comments drew ridicule at least twice from the audience and SNL actors looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio went silent."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as the Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who sent the following message: "To one of the bravest men: THANK YOU FOR YOUR RIGHT TO CRITICIANS."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, said West was just "being who she is and that's great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and shares an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
"We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now known as "the man who used to be known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rapper, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington has released a new teaser for the Toxic Masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has muted the stereotype of a maco hero, citing his screen-played character means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strongly" about dealing with the problem.
"I feel quite strong personally, at the moment - where is our fault with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grew up, in terms of the problems we see today?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is being taught?
What's being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they need to be men like this?
I think that's one of the important questions of the moment - how do we change it?
"There's something wrong with young people today."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make a sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he was "done with the battlefield and the horses."
In November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed he thought meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best thing to happen in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this plan, so that way, it gave me a family of the future and my life started from here," she said.
Rose played the character of Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, indicating a change from before.
HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people living with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasingly becoming.
Because of the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, fomented 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegation of an employee who had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted the claim had been spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and the website.
"Crafts, frauds and more serious frauds," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by strangers on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses that identified the cause of the shipments associated with Waters' office and disseminated information of Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These baseless accusations are false and a lie," Waters said.
"My staff - where their identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to this false allegation - have absolutely nothing to do with the leak of this information.
"These allegations are false and false."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is infuriating," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows he has no qualifications to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
You can't question the motives of the defendants.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican who ran against Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions that can be destructive and harmful to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review – Rowan Atkinson's Weak Intelligence Fraud
It's common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with a British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of Johnny English's action-comedy scam franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad it is to become a new country's export opportunity?
In any case, the eye-catching and tired-faced Johnny English has the opportunity to spoil the situation for a second time - the name of the gesture that is more than all things that he is a vast comic creation designed for the territory of a non-English-speaking movie audience.
He is of course a stupid secret agent with a strange character to relax the glamorous nature of Clouseau, little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious international traveller and spy agent Rowan Atkinson, who once appeared in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television ad, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two great moments in JE's latest film.
I love Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in medieval war clothes and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on the air, but the humor feels very weak and weird, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offer comedy as their material.
The joke was felt as if it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's inadvertent mistake was not to innovate and focus on Atkinson's films in the Bean persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground and disappointing the on-duty agent - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a proud prime minister who is struggling with political and unpopular collapses: Emma Thompson gives her best with Teresa May's side character but no good in the script for her character.
His intelligence adviser told him every active spy had been compromised, and he needed to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is clumsy and now works as a schoolteacher in some fancy places, but gives an inappropriate lesson to be a secret agent: some great jokes here, as English offers espionage at academies like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played back by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a fiery character hosted by the rather debilitating Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin, who excel in the Secret Service Under His Majesty, are back in action against the beautiful seductive female character Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic tech millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their adventures with a small task: disguised as a waitress, setting fire to and burning down a French restaurant; struggling to smuggle themselves into the luxury cruise ship Volta; and English sparks chaos as he tries to use the headphones of Maya Reality to get himself used to the Volta house.
All the funny scenes were well done for the final scene, but because it looked friendly and boisterous there was a bit of a sense of the children's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And just like other Johnny English films, I'm always thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
The Nafi Labour Party plans for British citizens to work four days a week but is paid for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It will see staff enjoying the weekend for three days - but still bringing home the same paycheck.
The source said the idea was "in line with" the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
Turning to working for four days a week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The policy study is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy and in favor of workers and the party's overall industry strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in a 2017 election campaign.
However, these aspirations are not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from "faceless directors" and "catchors" at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labor government can make a 'cut' on the grounds they are deemed to have committed an offence.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appears to be more open than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told him I wanted to attend the trial, I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, which the accusation came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's strong, he's strong, he's clear."
Graham's decision has been made.
"I have already made the decision of Brett Kavanaugh and he will take a serious charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know about this: Brett vehemently denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he names can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
Is the World People's Party and has the event done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that features a row of awesome stars and an equally spectacular mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gather at Central Park's Great Site to not only watch shows such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors will need to complete some tasks, or "actions" such as becoming a volunteer, sending an email to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
What is the success rate of the world's population over the next 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand an action, or just another case of "clicktivism" - making someone feel like they've done something by simply signing a petition online or by sending a sip?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who urge a movement with different goals.
They say these actions have helped push world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of that amount had already been distributed or had been collected.
The group also estimates that the identified funds have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Several important committees include Nutrition Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and developers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to donate <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 doses from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this unbalanced nutritional social injustice a story of past history," said Food Authority Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has decided to fund a project, Nutrition Power, which will now reach the 5 million women and children who need it.
Answers one of the Frequently Asked Questions on his website which asks "what makes you think we can end rigid poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult route and it will take some time - there are times when we will be disappointed and disappointed.
But, just like the previous civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because as we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e were among the artists who performed at this year's show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blocking" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Secretary of State
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on markets, including in the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved themselves at the Syrian government's invitation - purportedly to find a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to control the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to keep the sea lanes open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketable," he said.
Zinke said so while speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of oil consumers" in the U.S.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, stressing the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less the same, influencing and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its oil-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "heavy side" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin backed by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will assume the capacity of the existing pipeline to be 110 billion cubic meters and it is solely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies Washington's strong opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that the energy supply should not be used as a weapon to suppress and that consumers should be free to choose," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. action has drawn German national discontent, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called for the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy as well as in the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think cooking" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senators say.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" before becoming a presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When the question was open to residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider contesting.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our divided government and this includes putting a woman on top of her," he said.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think with all my heart about becoming a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern about President Donald Trump during an open question, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a Federal Court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "it's certain we need an FBI investigation before the vote is made."
However, one poll on Thursday, showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not be contesting in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "next" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not contest, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Political Studies Center.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest, with 38 per cent supporting him potentially contesting and 48 per cent disagreeing.
The names of other high-profile Democrats also discussed as potential to contest in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide it by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin highlights post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) track Palin at Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families facing this PTSD problem and those coming home with injuries," he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his son's arrest was "a significant one" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "they came home different, quite loud and wondered if they would be flattered for their sacrifice to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support opposing a U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing terror group attacks or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts made friend registrations to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who opposed this policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. The suit made by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "a member of his son's violent group" had abused him but U.S. officials had rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's in custody in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the most number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of evil groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of U.S. asylum applications returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigrant Appeal Board has allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Public Prosecutor for the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "disregards the state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances that lead to the application, and prevents it from violating the principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors also argued that the policy of preventing entry of migrants would worsen the U.S. economy, saying it was likely that these migrants would become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce."
Public prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled for domestic violence crimes and for gang violence in June.
Asylum will be granted to those who leave their homeland for fear of being persecuted because of race, religion, citizenship or for belonging to a particular social group or holding different politics," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Refuge is not meant to solve all the problems -- even if all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces on a daily basis.
Rescue work is becoming more frequent in Palu while death toll doubles
For those who survived, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very depressing," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was feeding her feverish baby in the abducted Palu city centre.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There is very little drinking water."
Residents seemed to be slowly returning to their homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures of the spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the aftershock.
Tears flowed as he scanned back as the earthquake rocked the five-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There's nothing to save us.
I was pinned to a wall that collapsed, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice calling for help, then kept quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of ‘buying back' with ‘propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper detailing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid advertisement for the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register - the most-sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in congressional elections on Nov. 6, an allegation China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election explain what U.S. officials have reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
Being a common practice for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now fighting a worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war was to target exporters in states such as Iowa that support the Republican Party represented by Trump, Chinese and U.S. national experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the move had troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press release in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "now it's more bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own independent press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepts the freedom practiced by the Americans, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the Beijing press, there is very little opposition vote and you can't see the real public's view of China's troubling state economy direction because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China avoids offers to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans Leave Women Voters Ahead of Midterm Elections Because of Kavanaugh's Story, Warned By Analysts
While many prominent Republicans support and favor Brett Kavanaugh, a Federal Court candidate who faces charges of sexual harassment, analysts warn they will call for a response specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The high emotions surround this story and most Republicans state in their records that they will continue with the vote.
Those things can't be changed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a protest at a Senate building compound as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for female voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president and rarely vote.
Before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a Federal Court candidate, analysts thought there would be opposition if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become very complicated for the GOP," said Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds in becoming a federal judge, it's also about the way Republicans deal with the problem and the way they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped elect Democrats to the newscast.
However, Americans seem to be divided into two and don't know who to trust in Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or perhaps believed Kavanaugh.
While 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have cheated in his testimony, only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made an oath-taking confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh convicted him of drunk driving when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his genitals in front of Ford during a party while he was studying at Yale University around the 1980s.
World Website Creator Plans to Start a New Internet Network to Admir Google and Facebook
World Website creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source Solid software created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real purpose was "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, playlists and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify which are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this private database is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information needed.
The company calls it "personal control over data."
Ihlam for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring specific resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several contracted development staff to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own independent apps without being centered in any location by using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not have any discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all their business models will change immediately.
"We are not asking for their truth."
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "the mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the interoperability and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Website Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been debating the need for a free website.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Website Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic for the new era of websites,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross recipient
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Priest Benard Vann who received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and did not immediately learn that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was erected and draped by his two grandsons in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "a glorious symbol" because the stone would have been opened 100 years after his grandfather's brave actions.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann carried his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal "filled with thick fog and withstood a heavy assault of machine guns."
He then jumped to the border and with "excellent courage" and led him before jumping on his own rifle and shooting three men.
The Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said her grandfather's actions were "something I can't possibly repeat and it's so touching."
He and his younger brother Dr James Vann also placed a necklace of flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Micheal Vann said it was "a great honor to participate in this parade" and added "true courage with the support so many people have given."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but are disappointed from watching the main show.
The list from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six main matches to be aired live each night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch the match.
One fan said the switch to a children's cartoon channel was "a non-lethal joke" through his tweets.
"Government regulations show that the broadcast at 6 a.m. is not suitable for matches so they have to broadcast the broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior deputy president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa si Khinzir," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were working on rescheduling the broadcast so that viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think when I talk about re-runs, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six o’clock on Sunday mornings it’s impossible that we can do anything until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the post is changed there are a lot of text retransmissions and everything is not pleasant to listen to.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a matter of government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as always - and we're trying to do something impossible for the fans.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "low self" towards sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with feelings of inferiority due to his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she talked about the gay right to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's nickname, he wasn't too concerned about winning in the Olympics.
The presenter remained in this long-running show, Kris Young on vacation for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" peers when growing up because "he was not socially accepted as a man or a woman."
She said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others are the things that have driven me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to prevent more countries from making homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the incident of falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unexpectedly immediate."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but said their age gap had never been an issue.
"When you went through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic sport at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age environment who went through the same challenges.
The couple became a father in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the expectations" of his life had now changed.
“If you ask me last year, it’s only about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
"There's more to it than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their ticket to London 2012 had been purchased - because he wanted to sit in front once.
"I didn't reach my heart to say, 'I can't possibly be there to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until my father stopped breathing and it was legal to die until I realized that my father would not live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there's nothing else that can match this," he said.
It was also the source of inspiration for her first song of choice - "Proud" by Heather Small - which she wrestled with during her preparations for the Olympics and still makes the roma feathers she wore.

Mickelson isn’t ready for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be ready to make up for the game so as not to end in grief.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was rested by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" games on Saturday.
Despite being the focus as usual for the United States, the winners of these five major contests spend time being cheerleaders and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for Le Golf National's golf course, where the distance is very difficult for a hit that doesn't meet the target.
And if the golf course is difficult, Mickelson in Sunday's ninth match will clash with British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the American player, missing four points, starts with 12 singles, starts with a fierce start, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and pats him on the shoulder and puts his hand on my shoulder and says he'll be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His confidence is very high.
He is well-known and has contributed a lot to this team since then, and this week.
I can’t believe he’s going to play in two games.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way and the way we think we should do it.
He wants to be just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record achievements.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought a shot of passion to his team.
"He's funny, likes to joke, likes to wear people and it's fun when he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's great to see him.
He's not just playing, he's playing more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their lead position will gradually disappear
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that a distant position in front of his possession could be lost in the final day of the Ryder Cup and complicate the situation.
The Danish player first participated in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win by a very thin 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 point count.
"You keep reminding yourself after the leading position in front at Valderrama; we also got the lead at Brookline but we lost and in Valderram we won, but we won thinly," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead with a score of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're going to fight hard tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
It's not over until the eyes have been picked up and placed on the board.
We have a goal that is to win this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
I've said I'm going to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who our opponents are - they are the greatest players in the world.
So pleased with his men's achievement on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I couldn't possibly guess.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's success should be highlighted and that's something different to do.
It's a great thing to be out there with friends and when everything goes well but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he has to give his best in her as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as individual players as opposed to team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where his position changed, while in a winning team at Brookline before losing in a surprise draw when the European team performed "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said in response to a question about the way Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, set the player's spirits on the last day.
"We have 12 more tomorrow, but if you all want to start as fast as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to line up our players according to an arrangement that we feel is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas had been given the task of fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter who were in the top spot of the first division.
"I made this rule because I think it's going to follow and cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice of individual players.
New German warships delayed again
The German Navy was due to receive its newest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the battleship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-deployment problem hit the fortunes of this huge project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a variety of flying and anti-aircraft equipment as well as some stealth features such as reduced radar detection, red light and acaustic capabilities.
Another important feature is the longer-term distance of maintenance - this latest frigate must be able to sail for up to two years from its base.
However, various obstacles meant that this sophisticated warship, which is said to be capable of highlighting German power abroad - would be outdated by the time the ship joined the Navy, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to commission the warship in and return it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known why the ship was repatriated, but the German press called some damage "software and devices" making these warships useless if sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software had to be taken seriously because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship would be operated by only 120 sailors - half of which was needed to handle the old Bremen-class frigates.
There is also a point where these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warships in the same class that the German army used during World War II.
In addition to the damage to the device, the overall price of the project - including training for the sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - an increase from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that plagued the latest frigate warships showed just how much the German naval capabilities were lacking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in parliament, admitted that the navy did face the problem of a shortage of movable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not get replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust settles bat life
The latest study, which is being carried out on an estate on Scottish highlands, aims to explain why bats use the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest discovery of the unique behaviour of mammals capable of flying and could serve as a guide to conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats, and soprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats in Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in specific locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also create mobile surveys using mobile tracking devices.
Experts analyze the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of each type of bat and its specie and the activity of this bat.
A habitat map and report will be produced to create a picture of a scaled-up surface of bat behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results of this study will show the most important habitat areas for bats and the way they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making grazing fields and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
Bats are threatened as a result of building and development work that disrupts the place of bats and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats similar to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They used location tracking techniques to identify insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land across the country.
They have ten well-trained experts who often conduct surveys, check the perch and sometimes rescue the bats.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first bat protection centre on the Threave estate at Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
David Thompson, manager of the estate, said the estate is the most suitable place for bats.
"There we have a very good place for the bats," he said.
"We have an old building, a lot of big trees and suitable habitat.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to carry out inspections before embarking on maintenance work in real estate because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy a bat's nest that would contain bats where this is capable of killing 400 females and bats, and possibly destroying the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is an error to kill, persecute or disturb or destroy the nesting place of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer for the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged people to help.
He said: "There's still a lot we have to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations grow."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyer prepares to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news" and said there were people who wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue German magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid <0x24>375,000 to cover the victim's mouth, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegation was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"Not true.
What they are saying today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an unsubstantiated and disturbing report of personal space," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said the player would seek damages for "moral damage that directly impairs his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a luxury hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of trespassing on the woman, according to an investigation paper registered in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that after the incident the player knelt in front of him and said he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and only fell for "one per cent."
The document confirmed Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but on the basis of likes.
Mayorga also claimed he lodged a police report and took pictures of the injuries sustained while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle them out of court because he was "fearful of the response" and worried about being "disgusted by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous solution because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester when this allegation occurred, and this summer he moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' over loss of car manufacturer
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added this was somewhat "disgusting" as Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would halt production of its cars at Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would lead to border shipping problems if there was no solution for Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 car units last year, 90<0x25> of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution at the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Several other carmakers in the UK including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover also expressed concern that the UK would leave the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks to supply chains in the event of a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's car production depends on the basis of installation based on timely receipt of supplies without having to be kept with the parts of the car being transported to the factory every 37 minutes from across the UK and the European Union for the car being booked.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on March 29, there will likely be a border dispute that industry players predict will be delayed and there will be a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will be halted.
Clark said Minister of Finance Theresa May's future plans for bilateral relations with the European Union "should be done with utmost care to avoid any border checks."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for now but for us to achieve this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must continue this highly successful supply chain.
Toyota can't say how long its production will be halted, but over the long term warns of rising costs and reducing the plant's competitiveness and in turn will result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the labor union responsible for the management of the union at the plant, said the union members are already starting to fret: "According to my experience, lost jobs will not return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and solid plan for the future of relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
A particularly important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected next week" as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a federal court candidate continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy public prosecutor or not and further disrupting Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the hottest gossip in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein intended to wear a covert tape to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president by using amendments to the 25th constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead it announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump who at the time was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to prevent him from colliding with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, in front of a Senate judicial committee, both of which gave the confession.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegation against Kavanaugh, which has delayed yet another full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date hasn't been set yet, maybe this week, I think it might be delayed another week given some of the things that are going on in federal court.
I'll keep you posted and I'll keep you updated with the latest news.
Some reporters will dispute this: Sanders has not held any White House press conference since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he did not hold many press conferences not because he disliked TV reporters trying to find "attention" but because he said: "I don't agree with them because they really want attention."
He said the relationship between the press and Trump would grow.
"The president has had the most question-and-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without giving any evidence.
The press conference will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press had the opportunity to ask the president directly, it would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of it over the last few weeks and this will replace the press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from newspapers when on his way out of the White House or while participating in open-ended question-answer sessions or during a joint press conference with honorary guests.
Social media is very rare.
This week in New York, the president pointed out why he sometimes makes an independent and bizarre appearance in front of reporters gathered.
Health Secretary Writes to EU Employees in the NHS About Their Concerns About Brexit
The secretary of state has written to all employees from the European Union working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to bear the costs of applying for European Union residents working in its public sector.
In a letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the withdrawal have continued, and are heading towards reaching a decision by the fall.
But the UK government has stepped up its preparations to deal with a scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that worries you all very much.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each of you's contributions, regardless of your nationality.
Co-workers from across the European Union and other countries, bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances health services and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The coach and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the cradle and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "there is no information on the type/to what extent of the injury at the moment" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year red shirt student, played in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five starts on Saturday before leaving the game, his total this season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they purchase properties in the UK and this surplus of money will be used to help vagrants under Tory's latest plans.
This move will boost Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The treasury is expected to cite up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase properties in the UK - money from this will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This move seems to confirm Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on non-tax-paying individuals and firms in the UK, money from this proceeds will help the government tackle the problem of homeless people.
This addition - in addition to the stamp duty already imposed - includes higher duties introduced two years ago on second homes and houses purchased for rent that may be subject to three per cent.
The treasury is expected to be able to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new properties were purchased by non-UK residents, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" because many of their owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of deliberately maintaining high property prices by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "shameful housing problem."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including rent control and repealing "innocent" evictions.
He also wanted more power to be given to members of the council to build a new house.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - this life must be better for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy a home compared to the British working hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is very far away, and the fact of living everywhere with humiliation is a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "main goal" would be to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to revitalize the third-placed North-East side in League One, less than three points from the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for the B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always drew me there.
The opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athetic said he did not feel comfortable following in the footsteps of such a well-known name at big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposal.
“For me, the success at the moment is ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities at the club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I'd consider myself a success if I could return the club to the Premier League."
Ross is just three years into management, having been an assistant manager at Dumbarton and was one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being relegated and changed St Mirren's fortunes from being relegated to becoming the next season's Champion.
And Ross said he is more comfortable now than when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalls, when managing Alloa.
"I know that I'm in control of my life rather than playing.
It may sound strange because I've been able to live happily and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still through it in terms of pressure and pressure to work as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I’ve always wanted to take care of it and now I’m doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I love all my adult life.”

The ideal time to drink beer is at 5.30pm on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heat wave brings good luck to British pubs facing problems but chain restaurants are under pressure.
Pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting firm, which compiled these figures, said: "Continuous hot weather and England's longer World Cup campaign means July will follow a pattern in June, where pubs are up 2.8 percent, unless restaurants decline even more severely.
The fall of 1.8 percent of businesses in restaurants in June worsened in July.
The performance of pubs that prefer drinks and bars is very strong compared to that of declining restaurants.
Pubs that prefer food also suffer bad luck due to hot weather, but are not as bad as restaurant operators.
Most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 per cent increase in sales for the month, while food fell 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and food analyst, said: "This decision seems to have been the same and ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the outdoor market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to shrink, sales are down 4.8 per cent compared to the year-on-year would have been worse with the cost pressure again.
The long summer heat hits restaurant operators at a bad time and only time will determine if cooler weather like we did in August will bring relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July indicating a slowdown in the newly introduced brand.
Observers for the sales sector in UK pubs, bars and restaurants The Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses the performance of data from 47 groups operating with a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion is an industry benchmark.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some just 11 years old - have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of over 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the page "Fake Insta"
This news further increases the danger of possible sexual content being sent through it.
Twenty percent of students said they had one "primary" account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some just 11 years old - opened a social media account they kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a sharp increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to Instagram photo-sharing sites.
This news increases the danger of possible sexual content being sent through it.
Twenty percent of students said they used a clean "primary" account to show their parents, while owning one personal account.
A mother found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter who urged people to "rape me."
A study by the UK Digital Awareness and Conference of Teachers (HCM) independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they kept a personal account.
Head of HCM Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers trapped creating an online space where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director during the governing body's general meeting.
Doyle is a famous Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explained this move is an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience for more than a decade.

Advertisements of breast milk pumps that make comparisons with cows bring conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pump manufacturing company got a variety of conflicting opinions online as their ads compared nursing mothers to cows being milked for milk.
To launch what is said to be the world's first "silent, wearable breast milk pump" tech company Elvie released a video of the music in the form of a joke to show the freedom that mothers who use the new pump can feel.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow's ward to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I'm a milk pump myself, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this isn't a nipple, it's my breast."
The chorus: "Pum out, pump out, I'm feeding the kids, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my boobs."
However, this ad published on the firm's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has attracted a wide range of reactions from the general public, many saying it gives a cheerful picture of the "horrible" dairy industry.
"It was an unnatural decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to bunting and have to give birth to produce milk, but unfortunately the calf is divorced from the mother of the cow within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It's definitely a trauma for cows and calves.
"But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children"?
Another added: "One ad that has nothing to do with it at all."
Others defended the ad, with a woman claiming that she found the song "very funny."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I'm still giving milk.
It makes me feel like a real cow.
It's a bit crazy, but I think it's what it is.
"It's a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at pumping mothers (often at work or on the toilet) and feeling like a "cow."
This is not an advertisement that compliments or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been dancing with a hidden pump in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the response that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be loaded hidden in a sweatshirt, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women pumping with dairy cows, we want to put breast milking and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing how to entertain and connect with feelings of freedom through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elsie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children are moving quietly to the Texas border.
The number of migrants detained has increased even though the monthly border transfers have not changed much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making child placement with guarantors increasingly difficult.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid of compromising their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adults in the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in front of Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either guarantors or family members of guarantors, are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt down the individual," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days according to the previous standard, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through a video conference call, rather than being present in person, to appeal their case for a legitimate position before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for aid will be deported immediately.
The longer the child is under custody, they are more likely to become anxious or moody, and this will lead to an angry act or an attempt to escape, according to protective officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents say that such concerns are higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children are struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They added that by moving children to a camp town without making time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends may worsen the trauma they face.
U.S., French and Turkish forces withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for Syrian refugees to return, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the strategy of fighting terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem pointed out that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we eliminate the Syrian territory" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specialised for training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led to refugees not returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomat said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the rebel-held area of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Russia-Turkey talks have diverted a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, insisted that the agreement had "real time limits" and hoped military action would target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, which "will be wiped out."
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to organise the first meeting of the new committee, which includes governments and opposition members, to redefine the post-war balance and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitutional article," and warned against interference.
Trump will win a second term
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expect, charges of impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In an undisputed situation as "The most dramatic finale for a president's office!"
For the time being, there are no signs of a leak.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average prime-time viewership of 2.4 million, in addition to 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast had topped the cable ratings, up to 3.5 million viewers on the eve of the premiere news.
"It's a fire that catches people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, lead producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," a story about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled the taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment.

The money is flowing into the middle-class competition.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election is showing a flood of money, as congressional re-federation shows two incumbents now running for the same seat.
The redrawn suburban Pittsburg district contested Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is competing against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennyslvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been gelrymandered in favor of the Republican.
The new 17th contest has started a fierce financial campaign competition between the main party finance machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politically intelligent groups have given Democrats an edge.
U.S. Considers To Punish El Salvador For Support Of China, Then Resigns
Dominican and Panama Republic diplomats have acknowledged Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a partner drove out the Trump Organization's management team.
Government Department officials decided to call back the heads of U.S. diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines are only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will have a negative impact on the Central American nation with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
After an internal meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any consideration for El Salvador's fines.
Vice President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import of administrative places in the meeting, according to diplomats.
And the three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no firm message or fines from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their evidence is supported by external analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on condition of anonymity.
Historical Studies
What will happen next may be Robert Mueller's special counsel's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has solid evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the side, as soon as he is ready to face voters, and possibly eventually a jury containing his counterpart.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's fall is bound to happen - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that all of us have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact how long this fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attempt a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, had the West not followed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that took place over the next few years.
The course of history revolves around such a point of inflection, and the course of unconstructed democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some point of this inflection now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper made a report that, last year, he had planned to record the president and speculate that the president was unfit for the post.
Rosenstein said the Times' description was inaccurate.
"What will we do if the FBI's new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the obvious allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And what's more, are we going to vote for the Congressional term that Trump will be held accountable for?
If we fail that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had conquered my embassy house.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a draw with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the European League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers are using this result as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the belief that we were going to get something and we have got one point.
We might be able to win at the end of the game, but the draw might be a more fair result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hoped we got three points but the competition was tough because they had good results in the previous game but, the crowd supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
"Last year was really difficult, between everything that happened with my injury, and the involvement in the club but there's a lot of fun about this place now.
The squad is good and the team is having fun; the training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of their anxiety.
Although the survey participants had a real idea of the way they wanted to be preserved, some had already discussed it with their family members.
Half of the inductees in the Nationwide study said they had been talking to their partners about the long-term cost of living.
Only 10<0x25> of them talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to look after them but don't take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as such options will be an important factor in figuring out the cost.
Take your financial advisor with you: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Complete your legal documents: Solve the legal war at a time.
Set up a health care representative in place so that you can appoint an individual you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You'll choose the people you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you can't afford them.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so you're ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communication system, authorities were unable to obtain information from the government of Donggala, a northern area of Palu adjacent to the epicenter of the quake with a magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary during the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The region, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the waters of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami has also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is located seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is always hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western Acheh province of Indonesia north of Sumatra on Dec 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean waters, half of that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A moderate tremor strikes the Pidie Jaya government area in Acheh, causing devastation and panic, reminding residents of the great devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 were killed due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's daughter arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor of presidential candidates Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of carrying out the attack.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of domestic assault, disrupting criminal reports of domestic violence and resisting detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when a female friend tried to make a police call to report the crime, she took the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded at Mat-Su's pre-talk facility and held with an unsecured bond amounting to <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He was presented in court on Saturday, where he had confessed "definitely, innocently" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three minor Class A offences, meaning he may be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a Class B minor offence, punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, the youth was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the allegation of the attack.
The case was referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with domestic violence crime reports and possessing a drunken gun in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions to PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: hundreds killed

Prosecutors demand extraordinary death sentence for NYC terror attack suspect
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, ramming pedestrians and cyclists on its route on Oct.
To justify the murder, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice with the intent to claim the murder sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder caused by illegal activities, which prosecutors often use in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "dangerous, cruel and degrading."
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice with intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a long time since the Southern District of New York has claimed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with murdering two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted of carrying out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel guilty in the days and months after the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video of ISIS on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal advocates representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We felt the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, simply prolonging the trauma of this event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense earlier called for the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, NIGEL FARGE should be held responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during protests at the Tory conference.
The former head of Ukip said politicians should "feel the jaws" of "Eurosceptics" - as one of Theresa May's MPs, recommended she should be given the responsibility of handling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative parliamentary representative Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK would "come out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by May is to resolve the split between members who support the members of the Remain Tories who joined the protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure the Chequers' tolerated plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The allied parties insisted May was in talks with Brussels despite the effects it faced - and Eurosceptic and Labour's power to choose between his package or 'disgusting'.
Bone told the Out rally to mean Out in Solihull who wanted to "throw away Chequers."
He recommended Farage be made a nobleman and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was given that responsibility, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MPs added: "I support Brexit but we must remove Chequers."
Setting up a protest against the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting in a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely untrue."
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in favor, it is not popular in our party and the activities that are on the streets and that have voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians would need to "feel the burden" if they wanted to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them get away with doing that.'
In a message to a vibrant audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrays Brexit, to feel its hunger.
“We are preparing a people’s army that gives us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud.”
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists waved a banner of the Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with the party's application during the conference's start.
"They said they could have an IT system in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradiction, for trade without borders," he added.
'These are all plays.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "study" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "study to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrat delivered his future plans during a ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a fierce critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with residents using the "town hall" format since Trump took office.
One member asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair a broken kingdom, and this includes a woman on the top flight."
Arrest made in shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at the 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," Murphy police chief J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, having a gun and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior with a height of 6 feet 6 raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears the gap of the world championship when the team ordered him to win, beating Sebastian Vettel
It was evident at the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's direction played an important role in the race.
From the start of the pack, Bottas started well, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and getting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should be final.
Mercedes then went into the pits in the next round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to-tire move that left the Ferrari driver free on the inside at risk of defending himself after a third corner defence.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and did not change tyres to target quick terminations and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He went into the pits in the 44th round but could not improve his speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It was a difficult day for Valtteri who had made a good race throughout the weekend and was gentlemanly in nature let me pass.
The team did a great job of winning the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It's a bad language.
President Donald Trump taunts Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally over a woman's insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly answer the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people were "cruel and ugly and liars."
"One thing can happen and beautiful things happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and ugly and who are liars," he said.
"When you look at the exposure and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leak?
Remember the answer...did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added, making an expression on the senator's face.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugholeh Ford in July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it as difficult and I kept it as difficult as requested."
But the woman's denial was frowned upon by the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I tell you, it's bad-mouthing.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst motion-language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusation to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, the cruelty, the atrocity, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored a goal for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led with a two-goal victory via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed the win for them.
This is the Elite League's third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous games.
The opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing an assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what seemed like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the hosts' eyes at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the assistant to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard again equalised by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen give Dundee their first win of the match late in the second and he secured the win with a fifth in mid-table.
The Giants, who have lost four of their five games, are at home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controllers Killed To Ensure Hundreds On A Plane Surpassed An Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controllers are regarded as heroes after being killed after ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers was able to take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his friend, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his place of control at a powerful swaying control tower at the Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He did not step in to ensure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this news," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still on the rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many are not reachable," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
A six-foot-high wave has destroyed the Palu which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back the body.
Clean water is difficult to obtain.
Small shops are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross Organization is rushing to provide assistance to survivors but we don't know what to find there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
You willing?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger is missing after plane crashes
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in Lagun Pacific in Micronesia, said one passenger was missing, after it said all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that as of Saturday afternoon, the company was unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had slipped off the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, and he had only minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said the crew on board the restored dock also provided assistance by using reconnectable boats to move passengers ashore before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network says 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give a timeline of women's nightlife being burned alive
Prosecutors restated Saturday's case in a re-trial of a man accused of setting a Mississippi woman on fire alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to organize the movements of defendant Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his mobile phone along with Chambers's phone while he claimed to be together with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in front of the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "deceited because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction is that Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Cell phone records show that they know each other for only a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted the text of Chamber's calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's taken the girl out of his life," Hale said.
The defense attorneys are scheduled to begin the closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative outlook of the genre by filling in their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, namely political messages and solving social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY nanny sues couple who fired her over "racist" text
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text that had been mistransmitted from a mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple denied they were racist, likening the act of suing as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"It's not just another black man," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
Upon becoming aware of his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "uncomfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that the previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing a good job and he expected the presence of nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal, and is demanding compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, in compensation for the residence he has been offered, even if there is no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not supposed to do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to allegations that they were racist, saying the act of ending Maurice's service was justified because they felt the woman could not be trusted after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you put your child's care on someone you've been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
It's not."
Analysing the suing act as an "extortion", Plasco said his wife had just two months to give birth and was in a "difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in such a situation?
"It's not a good thing," the bank added.
As the case progressed, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers are having a hard time connecting with talking bears, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's heartbreaking to know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspired to write a children's book, a small toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, the woman added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication as "sweetsweet" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"He's a quiet man, he's not a big talker," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too much of a life for him, it's like the feeling of having a child who achieves something that you're proud of even if it's not the one you made him.
I think he sees Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I need to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, the daughter was sent to Louis Pasteur 2, Nice Hospital in a hurry where doctors had been working hard to save her life.
"Nad calls me often to say that the situation is bad and she won't be able to be saved," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, “Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly exits and leaves his system.
He died before his time and this was all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was going to happen.
I can't shout or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning the loss of her son, boarded a plane with another passenger - who did not talk about the bitter experience she had.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I bow my head, and tears flow all the time.
It’s hard to describe, but on this journey I felt sympathy for Nad.
You need my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves him.”
Woman sends postcards to avoid suicide on bridge
Two women who lost a loved one who committed suicide, work to avoid others taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want anyone to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him with his smile.
They always said her smile could turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother met his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I feel a constant worry about whether this will cause other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He didn't tell me that he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything."
He said his partner's death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It made a huge hole in the family.
It divides us.
We have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on when the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a time-limited investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to unitation," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "scarred" in a standoff based on beliefs that had taken root.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for their decline is because of their incompetence.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and on November 6 - if as expected, the Republican results are not satisfactory, they will be weakened to get the person they want to appoint to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush had made calls to Senators, lobbying them in support of Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will convene.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the deputy president, to equalise the series and confirm his position on the Agong Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korea's legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates imposed by people smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang did not give any public comment.
Most of the North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than as political refugees and often sends them back in force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of slowing the progress of talks since the incident.
"Without any trust from the U.S., our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not start nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and did not deserve to be in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his birth was not appropriate to hold office in Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
“I believe that if a woman behaved like that, they would say she was ‘emotional,’” Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening of his statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrat in the committee, calling the charges against him "extreme and premeditated defamation" managed by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton who was killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that she was unfit to hold office in the Agong Court, as it showed that she was biased against Democrats.
"I feel he has stripped himself of his qualifications and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if she was confirmed, and if the Democrat got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not eligible to hold office in the Supreme Court, but only in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was seen as a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the decision of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's a fun step,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It is a natural nista word, an inflammation that months and years abound, and he does not hold back anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything special, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had invented a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm getting angry."
Then he continued on.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of channeling anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of an old job, in a man-dominated office, I found me crying with an unstoppable sense of anger, I was pulled by an older woman in the neck - a cold manager I was nervous about - pulled me into the stairwell room.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know you're screwed.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former female congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to prevent her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," he said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates who are competing and they don't need another candidate.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Due to events at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an effort to set up a tube, and she vowed not to contest until she earned <0x24>2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man would give him just <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm being punished?" he said.
When she says she won't launch a formal campaign, she feels a variety of feelings - grateful to those who support her, frustrated by a system that makes it difficult for her to ask for donations and that targets non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and she feels shot.
"You'd think I was having a heartbreak," Schroeder recalled of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would I put on my head?
"She's crying?"
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the trade war between the U.S. and China may be confusing, and although the fighting is not yet over, the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts said.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs that would impact the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value of items, an effect that would be like taxing half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliates in a similar way every time, most recently, imposes tariffs of five to ten percent on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. every step of the way, and the world's second-largest economy has not been impressed.
To make Washington resign means bowing to the will of the US, but bowing to the US is seen as too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, China's president.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, the U.S. trade war pressure could positively support China in the long run by lowering the interdependence between the two countries.
"The swift political decision by either Washington or Beijing could start an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and appear to be more dangerous than previous observers were aware of," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for the return of the country's political refugees and appealed for help to rebuild a country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for the return of willing refugees, to the countries they are forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to develop the devastated country.
But he insisted the country would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5, 10.5 dit Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, released a tee shot into the water in the par-3 hole of the 16th, succumbing to a loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers have excelled in all rounds, being 1 of the 4 players to be 5-0 since the format of the competition began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped to 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who may have played last time for the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a peak point of 25.5.
“I rarely cry but I can’t help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, I'm happy to get the trophy back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European promotion.
He has handed over the task to John Ram who has beaten U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I felt a sense of pride that, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching the man play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods suffered losses in all competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 Ryder Cup work.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 second-place major championships only on Jack Nicklaus.
USA teams struggled throughout the weekend to find a track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game of golf throughout the match.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance from his team, "I feel proud of them, they worked hard.
This morning, we're going to give the European team a shot.
We tried our best.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and Ryder Cup Committee and we will continue to move forward.
I love all of these guys and am proud to be captain.
You need to lift your hat.
We have been defeated."
Recent Red Substitutes: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Wildlife and Fish Conservation Commission shows a general contagion of the Red Crescent concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, clustered development conditions were reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a reduction in concentrations.
The development of the Red Crescent passes through an estimated 130 miles of coast from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee area.
The spot can be found at 10 miles towards the sea of Hillsborough district, but in an area less than last week.
The Red Cross is also visible in the Pasco area.
Moderate concentrations in or towards the sea Pinellas County reported in recent weeks, low to high concentrations towards the sea Hillsborough County District, background concentrations to high in Manatee County, background concentrations to high in or to sea Sarasota County, background concentrations to moderate in the area of Charlotte, background concentrations to high elevations in the area of the area of Colt.
Respiratory irritation is reported to persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
