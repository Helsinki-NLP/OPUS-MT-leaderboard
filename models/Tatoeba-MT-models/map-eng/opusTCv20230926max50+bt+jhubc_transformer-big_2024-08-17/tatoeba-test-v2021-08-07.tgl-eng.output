You need to know how to cook chicken.
You don't have to go to school.
You don't have to rely on other people's help.
You should go to sleep.
I wish you would listen to me.
I wish you'd told me yesterday.
You listen to a man even if he makes slaves of you, even if he spends all your money, even if he catches you in a trap, even if he is proud of himself, even if he slaps you in the face.
What you're saying, my friend.
You start.
You still have time to think about it.
When you talk, you think you know everything.
Try.
You two are really nice.
Your hair was long, wasn't it?
You've forgotten.
You did too much.
You left your ID at home, so you can't enter.
You've ruined your coffee.
You're hiding.
You will enjoy reading.
