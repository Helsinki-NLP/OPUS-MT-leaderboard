The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rises rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will require health care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent was a novel coronavirus now referred to as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Up to now it has been proven that about 80<0x25> of individuals with COVID-19 have mild diseases, e.g. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease that requires hospitalization while the remaining 6<0x25> of cases have a critical illness that requires intensive care.
The death toll of patients treated in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) countries and compared those countries with Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical transmission and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world at this time according to the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020, among those returning home from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), of which between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in every country around the world, obtained from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities as well as the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare that data with Italy.
As a proxy for the active spread of COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, therefore taking into account the natural route of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK countries, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases notified for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of Italian cases for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trend in the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This is largely driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, however all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar upward trend for cumulative incidents of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA and UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It stressed that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same number of cases as Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is on the rise rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is spreading at the same speed in all countries.
While countries are at different levels, the diversity in national public health responses and the definition of cases may vary in countries as well as different protocols for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including follow-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy described a situation in which 10<0x25> of COVID-19-infected patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA level for 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> cases only, respectively (data are not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed significant variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
A modelling scenario related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country for the spread of COVID-19 cases hospitalised associated with <0x3E>90<0x25> risk over bed intensive care capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Given that so far cases have formed clusters in certain carriers in EU/EEA and UK countries, as well as hospitals and intensive care units typically handle a clear area focus population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in the Nomenclature for regional units of statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The country, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the scenario of a gradual community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19-infected patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is currently taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and thorough approach is essential to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a stemming approach to a reduction, as expectations of a rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adjust their responses accordingly if not implemented early.
A rapid risk assessment also lists general health care measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity that sees countries likely to continue to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA national health care systems will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing havoc for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more contagious and affects more older people than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of issues about the newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and thorough view of the rapidly growing subject of the research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still require answers, we hope that these reviews help in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for Chinese people who have been urged to stay at home for the rest of the holiday season and weeks after the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and a related disease named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and soon spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to return home and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number 1 public enemy" and has the potential to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since its first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of viruses isolated from some patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in that new and rapidly growing subject area.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which originated in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important questions.
CoV is traditionally considered to be a harmless pathogen to humans, usually the cause of about 15<0x25> of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have twice found high-pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which led to the outbreak of their respective native outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe morbidity and mortality rates.
COVID-19 is currently the third COVID-19 outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the COV sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020 the first deaths from Wuhan were reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic is spreading rapidly to cities, regions and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections among healthcare staff were reported, indicating that human-to-human infections could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown with all public transport services suspended.
On January 24 the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation is developing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is yet to be ascertained.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected patients are over the age of 50, very few are under the age of 20 and only 14 are infected.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases is 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large, protected viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among which all alpha- and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors the angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane incorporation takes effect.
The viral RNA genus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forming vesicles containing virions, which then bind to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> genetic identity in 10 titled samples taken from the disease's origin site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron transfer microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest parts of the human respiratory tract epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new simple proteins encoded by orf3b and secreted proteins encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and have IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of human ACE2 is fully at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a complex with amino transporter asis B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had both open and closed confirmations, had been combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex could combine two S proteins, which provided evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug refining to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov originate from bats and are transmitted to humans respectively through fertilisers and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96<0x25> similar to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus to cross species barriers to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission path remains unexplained.
Ji, et al., suggest snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans that involve homologous recombination in S proteins.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed mammals used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of the genetic homology in CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1<0x25> difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to pass concrete evidence is pending (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 45 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and thermal radiation at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chlorophom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively deactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore thought to be vulnerable to novel viruses.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern-identifying receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as type C lectin, receptors such as Tol (TLR), receptors such as NOD (NLR), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).
Despite the different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and interferon type I (IFNs) cystes that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the protein N SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Shortly after that, the immune response of adaptations also goes against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by resulting in the apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity includes complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's overreaction generates large numbers of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst-case scenario, the failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the initial cluster, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
Being common for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of becoming infected than others.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as noted above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, while preventing those who are infected but have no symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals who are exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Fever is usually a major and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without any other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic sneezing, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed breathing assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of them require breathing assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher mortality by MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) are also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throat (13-25<0x25>) are the main symptoms and breathing assistance is required for approximately 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2<0x25> when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10<0x25> of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37<0x25> of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95<0x25> confidence interval (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and RO of the disease are shown in Table 1.1.
The numbers above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to be contagious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is far more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered beginnings often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected individual or patient in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have been cured who are allowed to return home from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) or decreased at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocytes sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, has increased, and the lymphocyte count has decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilaterally stained shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid accumulation of fluids and fibrosis adversely affect gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of type-I and type-II reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, while reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually parallel to the worst stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis for COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleic synthium cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, consistent with the pathologies of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathologies of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as a result of the high false negative rate, which may advance the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
The same is true for SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is important as well as imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protol use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip rod in less time.
Hopefully, the new technique can significantly increase sensitivity and ease if confirmed in clinical samples.
As a result of the lack of experience with the novel CoV, doctors can generally provide supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of the cured patient is also recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs in the early stages and may also attack, at a lower level, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Disfunction and respiratory failure, however, are major threats to patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives as well as including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary graphing technique used for the treatment of Cardium or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as sepsis shock, and protection of vital organ function are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms are the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Typhoon cytokine is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of various organs.
Immunisation is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat storm cytokines.
Other immunotherapeutic treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restriction; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time have been recommended to be used with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marlburg.
Then, remdesivir also showed the possibility of inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mix to China to conduct a pair of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects can occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs applied to the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of the cured patient and the generation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease has a long history.
True, cured patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralizes them directly.
Based on this, plasma has been collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been injected into 10 patients who are in serious condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and increased saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to suggest such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies have yet to be developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may overestimate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to wake up and produce special antibodies quickly to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients as well as identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or filters effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends a lot on the combination of various components in the formula that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or blurred as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, as a result of a lack of specific and effective therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery in the treatment of COVID-19 patients has been seen in some regions in China that use TCM in 87<0x25> of their patients, including Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>) and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13<0x25>).
However, this is a rather rough comparison because many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rates for symptomatic conditions became worse (from mild to severe) significantly lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> versus 46.2<0x25>) and lower mortality rates in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> versus 39<0x25>).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaiting more controlled trials at a larger level and in more centres.
It should also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective components in the treatment of TCM or the combination of such treatments if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience severe fear of a highly contagious disease and can cause the death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough and the adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, even suicide were reported.
The detection of mandatory contacts and quarantines, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people in contact with them as well as the public community who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human areas to vulnerable hosts as well as usually complementing antiviral treatment in epidemic control caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts have been made by developing S protein-based vaccinates to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Directly debilitating vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and their model of dangerous challenges and protection against zoonotic viral infections should be determined before clinical studies can begin.
This may be because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
By contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of continued zoonotic resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, some of which have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunodeficiency individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because a long period of time (average 18 months) is needed for vaccine development and dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without being re-infected.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas where resources are lacking.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 typically occurs at the age of 30-65 years with 47.7<0x25> of those patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at a median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients' results.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
Comorbidity and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute cardium injury and arrhythmias.
Cardium problems are also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be bound to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and hidden diseases are interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as potential prognosis factors for disease, response to therapy and final healing.
Links to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 have also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are secreted in many different organs, especially the heart and liver, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and progress of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other issues to predict the consequences as well as complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroid is an immunotribution commonly used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Considering the high dose of corticosteroids has been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong defects and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from unusual stress as they often face prolonged periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the death of close family members and patients' friends.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help this patient recover from stress as well as return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological feature than SARS.
In addition to doubling in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can multiply efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or period of incubation can produce large amounts of the virus while performing daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur during severe illness, while most transmissions do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities as well as continued quarantines of almost the entire population in hopes of breaking the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
While these actions have significantly damaged the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients has declined, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end at the end of March and the decline phase will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which looks much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model for predicting the consequences of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the central and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurrent episode such as influenza.
However, convincing signals have taken place in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually managed.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes weaker and eventually ends or becomes a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
Comparisons between COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS are provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with material that has been contaminated with the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, which raises new possibilities of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health workers.
Careful precautions should therefore be taken to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even people on the roadside in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23> 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from individuals who are likely to be infected from spreading through ventilation or sticking to the surface of the material, which in turn can be spread to others.
However, only N95 type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions able to penetrate N95 type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same as SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks that are worn together, health workers who have direct contact with patients should wear an N95 mask (series <0x23>1860s) instead of a surgical face mask.
In addition to face masks, health workers should wear self-protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflammatory eye.
Health workers also need to wear a protective mask or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For civilians in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with people who are likely to become infected.
A distance of three feet is considered an ideal distance to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection in addition to preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 alerted China as the SARS outbreak struck in 2003.
However, it was only on January 19, 2020 that the Director of Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to alleviate the concerns of its citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and limited reproduction in humans as well as prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
The message has easing public concern, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it is not welcome to curb the spread of the virus on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
Illness control agencies in China can take advantage of this and make improvements in the future.
For example, agencies should (1) be more careful in making public announcements as every detail presented affects people's attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to the unusual information received from clinics than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officers; (3) more strict in curbing epidemics rather than informing the public; and (4) more frequent training to improve public awareness of the disease and response.
The spread of COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world as of the time of this writing.
Since the virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also almost the same as SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sentiment that the SARS outbreak has recurred.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in stemming the epidemic as well as treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people compared to younger people and affects more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher for older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91<0x25> versus 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in sick conditions, resulting in difficulty in curbing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The results of an RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered can be found positive for the virus.
These findings indirectly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be addressed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96<0x25> of genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also comes from bats.
What is an animal that is an intermediary species that transmits the virus from a host, for example a bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't decide the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how exactly can viruses enter airway cells and subsequently result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically through human transmission?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, wiped out like SARS or repeated periodically like the flu?
This is important but it will take some time to find the answers to the above questions and various other questions.
However, regardless of the expenses to be claimed, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have prompted the joint evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known to cause mild diseases, such as colds.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed the outlook and revealed how HCoV is devastating and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019 has drawn attention to CoV and surprised us with its simple but less pathogenic infection than SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic and an understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non-pathogenic bats.
The intermediate reservoir hosts for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of the interaction of CoV hosts in animals allows for the importance of understanding the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this study, we presented an overview of existing knowledge related to the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as the zoonotic origin and transmission between species.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
Epidemic disease during COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful exchange of hosts as well as the implications for the evolution of the virus against the severity of the disease are also emphasized.
The coronavirus (CoV) is from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a single-stranded, positively charged, sheathed group of RNA viruses.
The length of this genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that shares the same structure.
It is estimated that two-thirds of these genomes have two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are then translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicases.
The polyprotein is then processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remainder of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including papules (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some protein accessory protein specific customers are also encoded according to different customers CoV.
Based on protein sequence differences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV genera are composed mostly of HCoV and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as gene sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are major reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have surpassed species resistance and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually result in moderate symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of a flu patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which resulted in symptoms of self-control.
The concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until the SARS outbreak appears.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and was one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a gross death rate of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread throughout the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings have been given and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCovs from bats, in which viruses are adaptable and non-pathogenic but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China as well as the rest of the world.
Detection of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and restriction factors for species jumping.
It may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries and feeders for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future overflow.
In this review we present an overview of zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we outline and discuss a common theme where HCoV virions are not pathogenic in the host's natural reservoir but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
We also reviewed the direction of HCoV evolutionary trends in which increased transmission often comes with a reduction in pathogenicity.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal cov has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of flu-affected patients, different CoVs were isolated in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) can provide information and instruction.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients who had a bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with symptoms of the flu, including headache, sneezing, lethargy and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialised citations in the brain of the lactating rat.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection looks similar to that of HCoV-229E infection, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to transmit more during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation period of both viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a few compromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-recorded HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first cases of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to super spreaders, it is estimated that each case can cause about two secondary cases, with a period of incubation between 4 to 7 days and a virus-free peak appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed myalgia, headache, fever, fever and cold, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphofenia, a diffuse liver function test and increased creatine kinase is a common laboratory abnormality of SARS.
Diffusion alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30<0x25> of patients then require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infections in the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in this severe case, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can cause death especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been undertaken for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially the virus was found to be widespread among children, senior citizens and patients compromised with respiratory diseases.
The presence of chorizo, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the isolation of the same virus from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and the peak time of occurrence of the disease is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crutches.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-infected pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
All four of the HCoVs infected in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of more severe HCoV-NL63 subtypes, which have recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, when this HCoV acquires the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS match SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from acute kidney failure, which has so far been unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case mortality of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruses to hit humans.
During the middle to the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an International Public Health Emergency and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a gross case mortality of 3.4<0x25>.
Notably, case deaths in Hubei, China were 4.2<0x25>, while case deaths outside the area were 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly increase into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homology of a high nucleotide sequence of 82<0x25>, the virus is grouped into distinct branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid transmission worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the timing of the incubation and the duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four community-based HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show features that are more often seen during HCoV infections that are found from the community, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern features for both community-derived HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is at least as high as HCoV found in the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after passing through humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-to-mouth transmission for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain conditions awaits enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be triggered according to the season as in the case of HCoV infected in the community.
However, features of SARS-CoV-2, including infection, pathogenicity and continued spread after passing through humans, will affect the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs that are infected in the community cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes severe disease in humans and people with severe HCoV disease, has been eliminated.
In order to allow this to happen, HCoV needs to be doubled in humans to a sufficient level to allow the accumulation of adaptable mutations that counter the host restriction factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the greater the chance for the virus to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four infected CoVs in the community circulate in the human population, triggering a common cold in an immunocompromised subject.
The virus does not require animal storage.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, are not yet well adapted to humans and transmission of the virus in humans cannot be sustained.
The virus needs to remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoirs and find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate hosts and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four HCoVs that are infected in the community.
It's as contagious as HCoV being infected in the community, at least at the moment.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than community-infected HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The timing will determine whether the virus will be fully adapted to humans and spread among humans without reservoirs or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the origin of animals that are the cause of HCoV, it is better to discuss the definition and features of HCoV's evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and breeding hosts.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close heir who shares a high homology at the level of nucleotide sequencing.
The hereditary virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, reservoir hosts store HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or its virions.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus is not well adapted to a new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as a breeding host by allowing the virus to multiply temporarily and then spreading the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infection.
HCoV can suffer from a dead road infection if it is unable to maintain its infection in an intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create long-term epidemics.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that SARS index cases have a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further investigations of seroprevalens showed that animal sellers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general public.
Larri mushrooms and raccoon dogs on the live animal market were first identified to carry viruses such as SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly by the fact that no more SARS was reported after killing all weasels on the market.
However, it has been reported that lamri weasels from forests or farms without exposure to the live animal market are mostly negative SARS-CoV, suggesting that lamri weasels may only be hosts strengthening intermediates but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Most significantly, given that 80<0x25> of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be hosts reinforces an intermediary for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of this seems to be a dead road host for SARS-CoV.
A further search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) of Rhinolophus bats related to SARS, which exists in Chinese lapidary bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92<0x25> of the homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for a new concept that bat hosts produce human pathogens.
Several CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except one named WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) exchange enzyme is known to be the recipient for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from bat feces samples was shown to use bats, ferrets and human ACE2 as recipients for cell entry.
More interestingly, the SARS virus was found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related offspring for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95<0x25> of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The sequence of RNA polymerase dependent RNAs from MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that the Arabian camel has a positive effect on MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, just as the camel in the Middle East is native to various African countries.
Living MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans has been isolated through an Arabic camel nasal swab, further showing that the camel serves as a genuine MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It should also be noted that generally moderate symptoms but large decay of the virus have been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Primarily, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory route but also through the feces-mouth route, which is also the route for the virus to be released from the bat.
However, questions remain since many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly linked to human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> of homologous nucleotides with CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
Needless to say, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-similar bat CoV is found in the future.
Possibly, the intermediate animal hosts to SARS-CoV-2 were from wild species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was linked to many of the early cases of COVID-19, indicating a possible event of the animal's spread to humans.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that small groups of threatened mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also store hereditary beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92<0x25> of the homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90<0x25> identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped in two subfamilies from viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in pilogenetic trees, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RDB) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4<0x25> amino acid sequence identity.
In real differences, RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more deviant, despite having a higher degree of genome-wide homology sequence.
Previous studies of infected pangolins also reported detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which were later found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study uses a collection method and selects a manual stack to generate part of a partial genome sequence that covers about 86.3<0x25> of the full viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the pangolin due to the aberration of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the highest homology sequences have been found in RBD between SARS-COV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoV is associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide homology sequence.
Strong speculation states that the high-level equation between RBD from beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the evolution of selectively concentrated intermittent ruptures.
A counter proposal favors a recombination between the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV pangolin and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving force, re-entry occurs widely in beta-CoV.
Studies are still being conducted on the direct zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 virions have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a three-color North American bat indicates a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat covs, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which have been detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected of being intermediate hosts.
To be clear, current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species is unclear.
But the alpha-CoV bats that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, bat alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and not pathogenic in bats, whereas alpha-CoV alpaca triggers respiratory disease in infected animals
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is unlikely to be excluded that alpaca gets alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats can transfer HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, although the bat's alpha-CoV becomes a subset of the HCoV-229E gene, the arabic alpaka and camel may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of transmission between species from bats to arabic camels and from arabic camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the beginning of the introduction and was reinforced with subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide the burrow of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long lifespans, dense congested colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal 'virus spreader'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to the Arabian camel for decades.
It adapts well to these camels that have transitioned from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low rates of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is involuntary and humans remain as the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the function of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV, the function of pangolin, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological niches with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Secondly, the pangolin may be one of the newly identified intermediate booster hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughtering and eating wild animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A review of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in third species that have contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of host animals, the three main factors on the part of the virus are also important in making it easier for CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, relatively their mutation rates are high in RNA doubling.
Compared to single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered "moderate" to "high" with the average exchange rate being <0x7E>10-4 exchanges a year per 2 sites, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to a novel host.
CoVs have exoribonucleases of proof readings, their blackouts causing very high variability and weakening or perhaps even the absence of vitality.
Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogs are known to suppress CoV doubling through this exoribonuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than its host.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoV does not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps, he has already adapted to other hosts that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the Arabian camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic shifts will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genomes in CoVs use additional plasticity in genome changes for mutations and recombinations, while increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of CoV novels when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs exchange templates randomly and frequently during RNA doubling through a unique "typical" mechanism.
In hosts that function as mixed containers, the exchange of strands often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
The highly homologous subgenome and full RNA can be recombined to produce a new CoV.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural incorporation has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus host interactions are related to transmission.
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that affects transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choice during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human-to-muscular secretions and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD in S proteins.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein in CoV interacts with cells and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid in S1 fragments, which binds to human ACE2 as well as to joint receptors for viral entry.
RBDs from SARS-CoV are able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, weasels, rats and raccoon dogs, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed to differ from human and feral viral secretions in RBD and 4 of them lie within the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The weasel SARS-CoV has mutations of K479N and S487T on its RBD, which may enhance the interaction of the patch protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units of the S protein suggests that the binding of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM research shows this bonding association is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptor may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors present, such as the aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and the 9-O sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after transmission between species from its animal hosts.
Aside from cellular receivers, the consequences of transmission between HCoV species also depend on the host's dependence and other barrier factors.
The difference in these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts such as bats, arab camels and rodents may create a barrier to transmission between species.
HCoV needs to seize the host dependency factor and subversive the host restriction factor for transmission between successful species.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the important regions of these virus-host interactions are still unknown and characterized.
Screening around unbiased genomes for host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may pay off.
HCoV's appearance novel: back to the beginning
The bat's CoV diversity provides a wide-ranging opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this respect, cov bats act as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV as well as act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans, as the SARS-CoV-related bat virus has been isolated but has been found to encode the scavenged ORF8 protein.
The nucleotide suppression feature-29 SARS-CoV has been found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes host exchange.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma CoV lineages, which a large number of smaller recombination areas have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to undergo a recombination event between different breeds, which occurs in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoVs recombining with other animal CoVs in non-structural genes.
Warnings should also be given that false selection may contribute to accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from freeing the virus from the pressure of the selection imposed, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 full length in the HCoV-229E prototype thread, as a result of the deletion of two nucleotides.
While strong ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpha displays single nucleotide insertion, resulting in skeletal displacement.
Lastly, the evolution of the HCoV novel was also spurred by election pressure in their reservoir host.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms alone have been detected when the bat is infected with CoV, signaling a mutual adaptation between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammation responses in bats efficiently reduces the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is inhibited due to increased regulation of natural killer cell receptor inhibition of NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression for the primary histokesylation complex of class 1 molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from bats' high metabolic activity can both resist CoV doubling and affect exoribonuclease proof readings, giving preference to highly pathogenic viral strain care when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to novel protein acquisition or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three HCoV novels have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
It doubles quickly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret causes of asymptomatic carriers are seen and the cause for severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mostly due to the activation of the hyper-immune response and cytokine storms in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been mitigated from CoV doubling.
The same strategy that deactivates the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflamasomes in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there has also been a bat CoV that shares 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although weasels and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
Beta-CoV pangolins that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, signaling that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV pangolins may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was produced by humans intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV has returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Thorough evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have their origin in bats and are transferred to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection is caused by human contact with ferns on the market, closing the wet market and killing ferns should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple lineages of beta-CoV pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through pangolins and other mammals needs to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the Arabian camel for a long time.
The camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local community.
It is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it is practiced in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent reinfection of the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, new genotypes may appear to cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are scattered in the forest.
Especially, CoV bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of a new CoV that is more contagious and/or could kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparations and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
The virus remains in the natural reservoir until there is a chance of transmission.
Although bats have many features that facilitate the spread of the virus, the chances of humans having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if the community is educated to stay away from the animal.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is by humans staying away from the ecological niche of natural reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.
Some questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered.
First, if a bat transmits the inherited SARS-CoV-2 virus to a pangolin, it will be interesting to see how bats and pangolins can share the same ecological nic.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we must determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins needs to be explained.
Finally, since many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and infection should be carried out experimentally.
Whether bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar hamprited parent virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" for COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our experience of being a good reference to fight this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also being updated continuously.
In this letter, we have answered a review of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
As of December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-10 a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advice guideline and the guide was published in the Military Health Research 06 February 2020.
That guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are slowly increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are to be updated continuously.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts substantially altered.
Now that our guidelines receive reviews by Zhou et al., they introduce easy scoring recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their important efforts and thank you.
However, their efforts also require updates in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Tested Seventh Edition) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of any one item of epidemiological historical features with two items of clinical manifestations to produce a thorough analysis, or it is necessary to fulfill three items of clinical manifestations if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) History of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms began; (2) history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 case infections (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) history of contact with patients with fevers or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas; or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cells indicates normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any one pathogenic item or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a genome-wide viral sequence showing high homogeneity to novel coronaviruses; (3) a positive one for IgM antibodies or a positive one for IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 testing
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples have been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection of blood samples has been included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increases the availability of different specimens, and supports bringing specific antibody positive results into the criteria that have been confirmed.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us to be wary of typical or asymptomatic symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The score system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend tracking and complying with the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Epidemiology (IEDCR) reported the total number of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 recoveries sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were aged over 60, two of which were 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, Anadolu Agency, that one of the infected was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport originally began on March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medicines, oil and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded incident of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak that is caused by the coronavirus.
This benchmark was present on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claims, as of Thursday, it is one of several countries free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours ahead of 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday were due to coronavirus infection.
Around the world, countries are announcing stricter measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, the head of the city of Moscow, extended the city's closure until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin has declared that Russians may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; the vote was confirmed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstaining, and one opposing.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to the rest of the day; before this, the curfew was only carried out between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to carry out a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the number of toilet paper towels once dealt with.
On Sunday afternoons and Saturdays, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and a one-off deal each in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a package, on Monday.
This limit is broadcast as an order on the checkout, and on the Facebook page of that chain.
Buyers are reportedly buying stock due to fears of COVID-19 if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery purchases to one pack per order.
This change was followed by a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the implementation of four-pack restrictions, "many stores are still running out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in a "sudden rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles booked larger packages from suppliers and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths booked additional stock, while ALDI made stock for special Wednesday plans available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects a rise in the cost of the product, when the supplier is trying to meet the demand, and a little special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the initial production of stock, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the stock every night.
He told the toilet paper was a large item, leading to a low quantity on the volume of stock, and, when sold out, leaving a large empty shelf space, further strengthening the feeling of inadequacy.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there's a variety of items on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and dehumidifiers can be [bought] and have a quantity, you'll probably reduce the panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet tissue manufacturer Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday they have run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper who makes Sorbent, insist that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports some real estate sellers offering toilet paper for free to the first bidder at an auction session in Melbourne, when a small number of auctions were held as a result of buyers facing time off during the Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of the NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores had initially refused to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 that saw them say they had no plans to introduce limits on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, dehumidifiers, dry food, hand washing and flooring.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon Ocado's online supermarket was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO)'s ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - a disease stemming from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - was a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the particular case may be, WHO is aware of the need to urge the government to act:
All countries can change the course of the pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people to act, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about both the alarming level of transmission and the alarming severity and the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence to the ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in short, things will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, announced as a General Health Emergency at the International Level on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide between 13.04<0x25> in Algeria to .08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may be between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatments are symptomatic therapy and support. Proposed preventive measures include hand washing, keeping your mouth shut during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruptions, suspensions or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread supply shortages driven by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, others of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industrial closures, there has been a decline in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and cause the virus to be thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest known person to experience the symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no visible contact with the later wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, while new cases were reported according to China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Koea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and under equaling 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60<0x25> of the British population should be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms alone, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source for 79<0x25> of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the increase number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who don't, the period of development of symptoms until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths are among those over 60 years of age, and 75<0x25> have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the dead who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die untested - e.g. at home, in care centers, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the stated number of deaths] is less approximation", a statement supported by a dogged report on undercounting in the U.S. Such less approximation often occurs in a pandemic, as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic H1N1. The first confirmed death in January was in Wuhan.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been used routinely to specify the number of deaths.
These figures vary by area and by time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths by case represents the number of deaths divided by the binaries of cases diagnosed within the given time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality ratio with global cases was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by area.
In China, the estimate for the death to case ratio decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for those with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case death rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of those diagnosed with the disease, and the rate of infection death (IFR), which represents the percentage of those who are undiagnosed and undiagnosed.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow specific populations of infections through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for specific populations.
Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection death rate for the pandemic is between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The top estimates for this range are consistent with the results from the first randomised trials for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the test's impact on CFR estimates.
The WHO said the pandemic could be under control.
The duration of the peak and peak of the outbreak is uncertain and can vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Abandoned unchecked, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to deteriorate when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable projections now about the time the situation will take place."
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that the "pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, perhaps for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (maybe 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus — because it's so contagious — will disappear completely" and it "may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The severity of the recurrence will depend on the group's immunity and the mutation stage.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (spitting), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become very ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, pain or pressure on the chest that persists, sudden confusion, difficulty to wake up, and eyes or lips become bluish; prompt medical treatment is treated if these symptoms are present. Further improvement of the disease can lead to severe septicaemia, dystrophy syndrome
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact with an infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates that the asymptomatic ratio ranges from slightly to 44<0x25>.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms begin) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.For example, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell initially 30<0x25> and then decrease to 15<0x25>.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread primarily during close contact and through small drops produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an unprotected cough will cause an ai drop to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops that remain for longer periods in the air, which may be generated during speech. Respiratory drops may also result during breathing, including while speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The drop may land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or may be sucked into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become sprayed and therefore result in airborne spread.
The virus can also spread when a person touches an infected surface, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but infection may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission can occur before there are significant symptoms.
Few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not very clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three others. The virus remains for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise washing their hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective sheath.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that coronaviruses are genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (subgenus B) along with two strands obtained from bats.
The virus is 96<0x25> similar at full genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in a particular part of the genome sequence between a virus from a pangolin and a virus from a human.
The genome-wide difference so far has found that at most 92<0x25> of genetic material is shared between coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolin to be an intermediate host.
Infections by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, though eventually through reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for infected secretion or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first line test for diagnosing COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being released on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal swab but a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Features of imaging features on radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) for symptomatic winds include asymmetrical ground glass relief and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Association is gathering an interbanga online database to find imaging for confirmed cases.
As a result of coping with other infections such as adenoviruses, PCR authentication has limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of the method as a screening tool in an epidemic area.
A circular neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect viral imaging cis with both radiographs and CTs.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall good hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on the tissue and placing the tissue directly into the waste container.
Those who may have already been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised to avoid all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a level of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who take care of a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method to determine the source of the infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement asking for a limit on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log in close to a user with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Wrong responses are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with mouthwash are ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop vaccines.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after exhaling the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60<0x25> alcohol by content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71<0x25> ethanol, 50–100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5<0x25> povidon-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chrohexidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or day care centers, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATM machines used by the sick person, should be decommissioned.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with bent arms or tissue during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of travel of scattered expiratory drops while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on how and when to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of people with COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made from cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community members, especially when in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
Czech Republic and Slovakia ban public places without wearing masks or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulated that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks daily since mid-March, asked intercity rail and bus passengers to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, while also recommending making a face mask at home for those who cannot afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by an infection control action aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum recommended size of gatherings by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the compromised immune system faced an increased risk for serious diseases and complications as well as having been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks "abuse" as possible, WHO and other health bodies began to "dispose"
The use of the term "social imprisonment" has led to the implication that people should undergo complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to fall in touch with others through alternative means. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes suggestions to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been suggested to those detected with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine directives have been issued to those belonging to a high-risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling outbreaks are curbing or suppressing, and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce infection control and other vaccination measures to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it's no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, efforts then move on to the stage of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.
The combination of preventing and reducing steps may be carried out at the same time.
Pressure requires more decisive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of managing the transmission of infectious diseases is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of health services becoming overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage transmission include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling large-scale gathering events; community involvement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screenings and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who self-quarantine themselves and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan is increasing the production of face masks and fines the draining of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that the reduction (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the emphasis (reducing the growth of the epidemic) have great challenges.
The optimal reduction policy could possibly reduce health care claims that peak to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to become overburdened.
Suppression may be an option but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as the spread will immediately rebound when preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic resulted in social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts to develop it are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking the flu medication given over the counter, drinking water and taking a break will help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the consequences.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being targeted for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also noted that some "traditional and at-home treatments" can provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients was described by the WHO as a basic pandemic response measure.
The ECDC and the WHO offices of the European region have issued guidelines for hospitals and key healthcare services to mobilize resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, canceling elective procedures when necessary, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about where the first case (called the patient's blank number) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was slowly rising.
The case is mostly attributed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origins. The pneumonia cluster whose cause was unknown was observed on December 26 and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at the Wuhan County Hospital, who informed the CDC.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was scolded by his superiors for raising the matter.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubles approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan becoming a major transportation hub as well as a railway exchange site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms as of January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and implemented border controls.
The national reaction has included containment measures such as quarantine (known as home sit-in instructions, shelter instructions, or emergency) and lockdown orders.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are under a form of emergency in the United States, more than 50 million people are in emergency in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in emergency in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in emergency in South Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a state of emergency, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed cases of COVID 19 were traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggested the earliest cases were on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed a cluster of pneumonia cases on December 26, and his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
An initial genetic test for a sample of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of a coronavirus such as SARS.
The public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 Dec.
WHO was notified on the same day.
At the time of this notification, doctors in Wuhan were alerted by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party chief <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
In what has been dubbed the "biggest quarantine in human history", the quarantine was announced on January 23 that halted travel into and out of Wuhan, which has been extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) are canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, the Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
Apart from the newly built hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took the next steps to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country are also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau began several measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
The move to work remotely has already begun in some Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions are planned in and out of Hubei.
Public transport has been renovated, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) are facing some kind of external restrictions. After transmission entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, the Chinese mainland was only one case of domestic dispersal within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that cases of domestic transmission had been basically blocked and that the transmission had been controlled by China.
The same-day travel restrictions have been relaxed in Hubei, other than Wuhan, two months after the emergency came into effect. China's Minister of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry through visa or resident permit holders will be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on the timing of this policy to expire.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encourages businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and the preparation of a financial stimulus package to the firm. The State Council declared a day of mourning starting with three minutes of quiet time at 10:00 a.m. on April 4, in conjunction with the Qingming Festival, although the federal government asked families to show respect online as to comply with physical distancing to avoid a repeat COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The national health agency reported a significant rise in cases confirmed on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu from a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji's visit to Daegu from Wuhan is suspected to be the cause of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 people or about 13<0x25> reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 cases on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed that three military personnel had tested positive for the virus.
The airline’s schedule was also affected and the schedule was changed. South Korea introduced a program that is considered the world’s most extensive and organized program to screen the population for detecting the virus, and isolate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine the people who are in contact with them.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of simpton by new international arrivals via mobile apps, a guide virus test with results available the next day, and an increase in test capabilities that allows up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program was considered a success in controlling the epidemic even though it did not quarantine the entire city. The South Korean community was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans signed a petition to either demand Moon's dismissal over what they accuse the government of being an abuse against the outbreak, or praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of cases a day in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that starting 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
As reported by media on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.

A CNN report stated that a combination of Italy's large population of elderly people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus to this day may be a contributor to high mortality rates.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most calm affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being seen as lacking in speed and seriousness in its response to concerns faced by society. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising to avoid all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home whenever possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all operating places such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of employees' salaries up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 a month to avoid unemployment in the crisis.

South Korean society was initially unclear about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition asking for Moon's dismissal on what was seen as a government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in return.
Some commentators have voiced concern that the move would allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule by decree on a permanent basis, suspend parliament and elections and punish those deemed to have spread misinformation about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from the use of equipment to fight rising outbreaks around the world, panic buying, and disruptions to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand as well as supplier disruptions.
Some areas also saw panic buying that caused slippery shelves of necessities such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has also led to a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, with the WHO warning that this would jeopardize workers' health.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has caused a shortage of infant formula in several supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Despite the prevalence of high cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and Wuhan province, as well as the ongoing high demand for food products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the collection of goods and sale of essential products have been successful, avoiding severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural production did not see a major reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
The empty food shelves are only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials are releasing pig stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
The same law exists in Italy requiring food manufacturers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5<0x25>.
As China's mainland is a major economic and production hub, the virus outbreak has been seen as bringing a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will remain downhill until a clearer image emerges of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic collapse caused by the epidemic on world growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at the University of Washington in St. Louis is impacting <0x24>300<0x2B> billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be "tough" after a plunge in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing concern about the spread of the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industry Average reported the worst fall since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, the GmbH Scope Assessment confirmed China's credit rate capability, but maintained Negative Reviews.
Stocks slumped due to fears of coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many people think there will be an economic crisis.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central and state bank's timely emergency move.
The central bank responded faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is the sector worst affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the government's recommendation not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional airlines at British Flybe have been buried.
The impact on the cruise ship industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic happened by chance when Chunyun, a massive travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several public events have been cancelled by the state and provincial governments, including the annual New Year festival, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and parties at traditional temples.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and provinces, authorities extended New Year's holidays until February 10, ordering all workplaces not to reopen until the date.
The region represents 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong raised the response level of disease infection to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reduced business hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60<0x25> drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> drop in walking traffic to shopping malls in March versus February.
Shopping mall operators around the world are implementing additional measures, for example improving hygiene, installing heat scanners to check visitor temperatures, and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-driven recession could cause an additional 14 to 22 million people to experience extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in that situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the nearly 300 million migrant workers from rural China have been stranded at home in rural areas or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could wipe out 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32<0x25>, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Emergency in India has left tens of millions of foreign workers in India (paid through daily wages) out of work. A survey from the Institute of Angus Reid found that 44<0x25> of Canadian households are unemployed. Nearly 9<0x25> of Canadian households are unemployed.
In mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary non-employment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
Short-term work compensation schemes have been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the organization's operations as well as individuals - both working on payroll and independent work - around the world.
Art and cultural sector organizations are trying to improve their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to communities, maintain the safety of their employees and communities, and support artists where possible.
As of March 202, around the world and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, events and performances are cancelled and postponed until an indefinite time.
In response, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly plummeting fall from the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent of the Christian repentant season, had been cancelled.
Many bishops have suggested that elderly Christians sit at home rather than attend church ceremonies on Sundays; some churches have held church services by radio, live stream online or television while others offer past-guided worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome shutting down churches and small churches and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian congregations, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gudwara.
Iran's health minister announced Friday's cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and the tomb was subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia barred the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has resulted in a very significant disruption to the sports calendar around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, 2020 UEFA Euro, 2019–20 NBA season and 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak affected plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not to exceed summer 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have been closed as well as live poker matches have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gambling footers to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling tour concerts.
Many large theaters such as Broadway theaters also hang up all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating a web-based "festival" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to jokes and entertainment behind the uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, rising prejudices, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot locations in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and rudeness have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments portrayed in various groups around the world saying Chinese people deserve the virus or receive what is allegedly a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There is support for China, both domestically and offline, as well as for those in areas severely hit by the virus.
Following the outbreak in a new hot-spot country, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to have a serious COVID-19 outbreak, can also be victims of suspicion and xenophobaia. People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a petition lobbying to ban Chinese from entering the meeka country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan went viral on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increased levels of racist harassment, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "China Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which shares borders with China, and is studying in India's main city have reported experiencing disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese people have destroyed the environment and "that's why God reciprocates their actions."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign rubbish" and targeted for "exile".
Many newspapers with paid ads have issued them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make epidemic-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results immediately on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of the virus as well as methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
The exact death rate from the disease and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of their population, and there is a great diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across the countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect the reported death rate of cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to double in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second minngu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from within the airway in using inhalation catheters or cough-catheters (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription of real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR) reactions, and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed tests by January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kid, a sylinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It finds the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Product Administration for SARS-CoV-2 detection kits through PCR-based COVID-19. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDI)
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results as a result of the damaged reagents, and bottle neck tests at the CDC in Atlanta; this averaged less than 100 of these samples a day were successfully processed throughout February 2020;
The test using two components could not be reliably verified until February 28, 2020, and before that state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics is also making COVID-19 testing available across the country from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests have been developed and produced by the VECTOR National Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Supervision in Health. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high numbers, while allowing one machine to perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use (EUA) permit to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued a similar authorization to Geologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, the same Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid augmentation technology instead of PCR.
As this test does not require a variable series of temperature cycles this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to accelerate production to deliver 50,000 tests a day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the novel nucleocapsid proteon (N protein) coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes just as fast as the influenza test.
In March 2020 a review of the writing concluded that "the chest radiograph had a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the discovery of CT [computerized tomography] may have been present even before the symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include the opacity of multilobar bisected ground glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions.
Subpleura domination, crazy openings and mergers are formed as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging features acting with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first line test for diagnosing COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals starting 7 days or later after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance. An assessment can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
High-skill automatic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out these assessments but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
For CLT single specimens of peripheral blood are usually used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of detection measures were not required prior to evaluation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided the agency with the necessary information and therefore are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kit, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR assessments for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found no antibody test kit purchased good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme that sees patients suspected of staying at home, "emergency department will give tube specimens to patients", they spit into the tube, send back and get test results shortly afterwards. NHS British has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test a suspected case of at home, which removes the risk of patients infecting other people if they go to the hospital.
The driving center has helped South Korea perform among the fastest, most thorough tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Specialists said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in an ambulatory setting and 10,700 were tested in the previous week.
Expenses are borne by health insurance when tests are requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, driving tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
The first laboratory survey revealed up to 12/2020 calendar week a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Hospital Technion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by collecting samples.
With the construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown the cases in Hubei will be 47<0x25> higher and the corresponding cost to operate the quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's lab has been immediately followed by Hou Yan's lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily amount is 50,000 tests a day. Open source, a multiplex design released by Origami Assays has been released that can test a total of 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 evaluations. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid operators.
Until March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had made overcrowding for mass testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating the sample at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for further testing.On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is testing more of its citizens for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and is on the right path to increasing the scale of the test level to reach the bulk of the population.
This is through the combination of past driving capabilities, and the purchase of a population-scale mass-processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of running thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be operated outside of China.
Different test exegesis targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method of producing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
German methods were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until January 28, delaying existing tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of its outbreak, and this country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
Experts, on the other hand, said South Korea's broad willingness to make tests helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for improving test programs as the best way to slow down the speed of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the arrears of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of sweeps and chemical regens to be limited.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC has a "weakness"; the government subsequently issued a bureaucratic restriction that has prevented private testing. The Spanish state purchased the test kit from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The firm explained that the inaccurate results may be the result of a failure to collect samples or use the kit properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it will retract the kit that returned the wrong result, and will replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test kits purchased by the Chech Republic from China gave the wrong results. The Slovak nation purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which was found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit be disposed of to the Danube.Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health told the test kit that Turkey purchased from China had "high error rates" and did not "use it". The UK state bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced this test kit could not be used.
The tests, followed by quarantining those tested positive and tracking those in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in, gave a positive result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, Italy's first COVID-19 death site, conducted two rounds of tests across a total population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day interval.
Nearly half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions, it has eliminated new infections altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, incoming travel restrictions, tests, and quarantines, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved more slowly than in other developing countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools will reopen in time after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by aggressively detecting contacts, travel restrictions, exams and quarantines, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, had a low mortality rate, perhaps because these countries were able to better detect those who only had mild or indirect symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have a national testing and laboratory capacity with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positive as <0x25> test" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
Countries that only tested individuals admitted to hospitals would score a higher positive score as a <0x25> test compared to countries that tested all citizens, whether they showed symptoms or not, the rest were the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands that aims to remove soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and years, which are spread through the fecal passage to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day that see hand washing with soap are important including: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's back or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after taking care of sick people.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the children who have used the toilet.
After exfoliating the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal shit.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to wash your hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower the infant mortality rate at home birth.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in high growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate due to the disease by almost 50<0x25>.
Interventions that organize hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhoea by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to avoid diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), as automated behaviors are carried out in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diabetes and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, instilling the habit of washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or drug mix, reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and dying from acute respiratory infections by nearly a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing can also protect against impetigo that is transferred through direct physical contact.
A minor disadvantage when washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness in the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day during which hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal infections to the mouth: after using the toilet (sucking, puckering), after cleaning the child's back (changing diapers), before bribing the child, before eating and before/after preparing or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent transmission of the disease including before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or exhaling of the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after holding trash.
The rate of hand washing using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, handwashing studies in 54 countries found that on average 38.7<0x25> of households had the practice of hand washing with soap. In 2014, a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Several methodologies of hand-changing behaviors now exist to increase hand washing with soap at critical times. Disciples
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to improve the health and education of children.
Washing your hands twice a year with soap and brushing your teeth daily with florida is at the core of this national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier on the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are components of organic soil, are insoluble in water.
However, the proper drainage of the water helps with cleaning.
Due to its reusable nature, tap soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on bacterial transfer from contaminated tap soap have found that transplantation is unlikely because bacteria are removed when washed with foam.
The CDC’s website still states “liquid soap that is removed without using hands is better”.
Antibacterial soaps get a high promotion for people who are important to health.
There is no evidence so far that using antiseptics or recommended disinfectants selects antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance to strains of the organism.
So, although antibody-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as those marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the antibacterial properties of the common antibacterial substance at the University of Oregon shows that
Water is not too hot to wash your hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to get rid of natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike what many people believe, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial content on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand sanitizer agents (also known as alcohol-based sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with thickening agents such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into the gel, or humectants such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
By adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. A hand sanitizer containing a minimum of 60 to 95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient disinfectant.
Alcohol consumption kills bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic rubbing cleaners containing 70<0x25> alcohol kill 99.97<0x25> (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand cleansers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type of virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or adequate rubbing of alcohol must be used to moisturize or protect both hands properly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers is rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Finger tips should also be washed well, by rubbing them on both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubbing, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The use of this agent is increasing due to its easy use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing except when there is no soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effects of dry alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused a significant reduction in irritation and dryness of the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubbing is rare.
The tendency to reduce contact dermatitis is more of an attraction than using soap and water to wash your hands.
A non-watering agent, although effective, does not clean hands from organic matter. It simply disinfects.
This is why hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, because the pathogens are still on hand.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulations, and historically it has been less successful than alcohol and alcohol rubbing.
In recent times, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol that has been shown to decrease its effectiveness after use many times, possibly due to a progressive inappropriate reaction on the skin.
Most low-income people cannot afford soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Concern exists if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase from reducing disease transmission.
Ash is also a soap-like disinfecting agent because it forms an alkaline solution if it has contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Water flow is recommended because the standing base may be contaminated, at the same time the water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than just water.
Chill for at least 20 seconds.
Spinning creates a shift, which helps remove germs from the skin, and cushions by longer removing more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing your hands in the washing machine can re-create the hands.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet, moist hands are easier to get dirty again. Fingernails, wrists, the part between the fingers and under the fingernails are the parts that are always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in false nails and peeled nail polish.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are a variety of cheap options to facilitate hand washing if there is no tap water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from hanging cans or pumpkins with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "tippi piping" and other cheap options.
Tippi pipe is a simple technology that uses a rope-hanging jug, and a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water over the hand and a piece of soap.
An important part of the hand cleansing process is effective hand drying, but there is debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towels industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene when using paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria on the bottom of the fingertips was found to increase on average by 194<0x25> and on the palms by 254<0x25>.
Drying with a jet air dryer resulted in an average increase in the number of bacteria on the bottom of the fingertips by 42<0x25> and on the palms of the hands by 15<0x25>.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria on the bottom of the tip is on average reduced by up to 76<0x25> and on the palms up to 77<0x25>. Scientists also perform tests to determine whether potential cross contamination occurs from other bathroom users and the bathroom environment of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air out of the unit at an alleged speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of exploding microorganisms out of the hand and unit and potentially polluting other bathroom users and the bathroom environment by as much as 2 meters.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Hand washing for medicine had long been an obligation when Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that alert hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found that its use can reduce the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to rinse and rub each part of your hand.
The hand needs to be rubbed together with the finger that is inserted glaringly.
If there is dirt under the nail, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since the germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and wipe them until they are dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, the paper towel should be used to cover the water (and open the exit if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when touching the surface.
Hand washing in a healthcare environment aims to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("cubes") and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, in turn spreading microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing standards for how to wash and rub hands in the healthcare sector.
A hand sanitary draft of this organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review has been conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and confirm hand hygiene, if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" to Wash Your Hands:
After being exposed to blood/liquid
before the aseptic task, and
after treating the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals on soap (soap "cure" or "antimicrobial") gives the killing action to the hand washing agent.
Such a killing action may be desired before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'wash' one's hands for surgical operations, there should be a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching with hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washing, a sterile towel to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to brush other nails to scrub.
All the jewelry needs to be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms until the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the forearm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After finishing washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical shirt is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after treating the sick.
To control staffing infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20<0x25> wash, and very little added benefit was gained when the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap produces more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing hands with alcohol solution by washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each showed that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubbing to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and Klostridium difisil spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hygiene in a healthcare environment can involve education for staff about hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand rubbing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of predictable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing pipes close to each private and public toilet is extremely rare, although there are cheap options available to build a hand-washing station.
However, low hand washing rates can also be caused by habits embedded in the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found an effective community-based approach to improving hand washing at LMIC, while a social marketing campaign was less effective. An example of a promotion of hand washing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to finally three stars,
Developing a hand washing station can be part of a promotional hand washing campaign done to reduce illness and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of hand washing emojis.
Several studies have considered the cost-effectiveness of thorough hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY.
Yet one survey shows that promoting hand washing with soap is far more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the founder of British modern nursing.
At that time most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness about in many countries the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the restrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hand from" something, means declaring one's reluctance to take responsibility for that thing or sharing involvement in it.
It is derived from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to wash away the imagined stains, which represent her feelings of guilt about the crimes she has committed and which she influenced for her husband to commit.
It was found that people, after remembering or rethinking unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other payment "washing" actions, such as doing volunteer work.
Religion sets hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolically washing hands, by using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual of hand washing found in many religions including the beliefs of Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also sets clean hand washing especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims also require washing their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control against COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the work site and work task, based on risk assessments for the source of exposure, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors each employee may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a low risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the general public and other co-workers, whose basic infection prevention measures are proposed including hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Jobs with a moderate risk of exposure include jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as at school, working environments with high population density, and some high-volume retail environments.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing guards, and having personal protective equipment in case of colliding with people infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues who are exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from people known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes engineering controls such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and self-protective equipment that is suitable for work tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects in the workplace.
Employees may not be present for work due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of being exposed.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of the items requested, and how to get these items (such as shopping outside peak times or through a delivery service or a guide).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas directly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. The preparedness and response plan of infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with various job sites and occupational tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and risk factors for each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the pandemic.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to the recommendation of a national or subnational plan.
Objectives for response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the last is personal protective equipment.
Engineering control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazards to the employee, properly installed according to suitability (e.g. respirator), worn consistently, constantly inspected, preserved and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contact with the general public and other colleagues.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics including closing when coughing and sneezing, preparing tissue and waste containers, preparing for telework or work shifts if necessary, not encouraging employees to use other people's tools or equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting at work.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms sit at home until they are free of fever, fever marks or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-relieving drugs or other symptoms-altering drugs, and flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to sit at home to care for sick family members, and workers know about these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around business locations, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes employees who have contact with the public such as at school, working environment with high population density and some high-volume contact environment.

Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of a respirator.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect the employee and other passengers includes isolating the sick person from another person by 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews need to wear disposable medical gloves when treating a sick traveler or touching potentially contaminated body or surface fluids, and possibly additional protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biobahaya bags, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and decontaminated afterwards. For commercial delivery including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, isolating oneself and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up actions should be made in the cabin of an isolated person. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean up or disinfect if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and choir classes or dining in cafeterias, adding space between desks, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a high level of transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extension of school termination can be considered. The CDC considers the overall health risk for enforcement members who perform routine activities to be low.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, employees should clean and decontaminate their belts and equipment of duty before re-use with spray or household cleaning wipers, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of PPE used and for laying and washing clothes.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues to be in the high or very high category of exposure risk.
High-risk occupations include health care delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It becomes a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs an aerosol production procedure on, or collects or handles specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
High exposure risk mortuary jobs include employees involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol production procedures are performed.
Aeration with specific negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens need to be controlled with the vigilance of Stage 3 Biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated to different waiting places depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those working within 6 feet of patients who are known, or suspected, to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter facial respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fit testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and increase worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covering clothes because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for entrance examination personnel.
For those collecting respiratory specimens from, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol production procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or face protection, protective clothing and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using only the necessary PPE for specific tasks, continuing the use of the same respirator without removing it while keeping many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relieves the burden and is ready for the future
TARIKH/MASA HANTAR: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CLOSE: CC0: No reserved rights
We found ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our interconnectedness in the world and the responsibilities we have towards each other clear.
We have never had a challenge like this before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues through email, phone and chatter is an extraordinary confirmation for the extraordinary human being we are lucky enough to be able to work together.
I am so grateful and proud to be your co-workers.
Last week, some of them shared their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how much the world means now when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how powerful it is as this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you keep your website active or your co-workers paid or our community safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, more so now.
This is a moment that not only does what we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adapting to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we considered what we thought would be a response to what we were dealing with and the best way to ensure this organization survived at the moment.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to slow down a bit, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy will be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work at regular times, the mission can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of a loved one, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We won't record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This shouldn't have been told, but we told him.
No need for sick days or PTOs - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with the support and ensure that your condition gets appropriate attention from the management.)
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have informed and affirmed the commitment to honor the commitments of our contractors and staff colleagues who are paid by the hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be very satisfying to us, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are some things we need to keep going.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Security, and Fundraising teams (among them) are doing critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We don't plan to move "twice to catch up on what's left" once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP (Yearly Plan)?
To adapt to the actual reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we would like to adjust the timeline of the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgets to allow employees to prioritize their loved ones' critical work, self-care and care while helping those who are in need or want to work with a reduced working period for the next few weeks.
The extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and stress of current plans across the organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will notify the representatives and teams of the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, disclosure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus solutions to disinfect every surface as well as lobby and elevator systems that reach our level.
The building adopts its own maintenance duty protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well available when we decide to return.
Our D.C. office is located at WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all D.C.-based staff members.
As of last week, our D.C. office has shifted to remote setups fully aligned with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based co-workers know, we're also talking about one-site piracy in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues know that it can be an adjustment and want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of the meeting to an additional one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it for a few days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the reading material first.
Make videos default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make collaboration and direct connections easier.
Having a leader to handle each meeting, one to monitor the conversation for questions and keep track of the list of speakers, and one helps to take notes (or do note taking collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphones.
Use your well-being reimbursement for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to chat with your co-workers about distributed tasks
The HR Operations Team is looking at the ergonomic webinar guide to support improvements in tasks distributed throughout the Foundation.
Over the past few weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edits until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may be impossible in completing their agreed grant activities and that no action will be taken due to delay or modification of that goal.
In the coming week we will make a follow-up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment from across the global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but feeling relieved at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Moving forward, CRT strives to develop a page about Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and comply with our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting of staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We're here together and we're here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep all these pages updated and all information in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a country that is very impressed at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or whatever help you need, don't hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help in providing support and to be a liaison if needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of Global Operations at International HR.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our work and responsibilities.
However, all of this is recognition at the moment, our work and responsibilities are likely to need to be adjusted in a way unlike the past.
These are the steps we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world services they can expect.
Our task is to be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks to arrive in the weeks and possibly the months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be ready at your best when the need comes.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and those others in the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that connects to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 confronts the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug targeted at treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry center into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and the C-terminal renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pathway type 1 membrane protein, with its active enzyme domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of the ACE2 cell is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resultant protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is twined on the cell membrane of most alveolus cell type II lungs, entrocyte small intestine, artery and venous endothelium cells and arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE attaches the hormone I angiotensin to the narrowing of vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe).
ACE2 can also bind to a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane distribution of neutral amino acid transporters SLC6A19 and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry center into cells for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the S1 protein of the nails for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the enzyme domain on ACE2 over the cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes is located between cells.
The admission process also requires the invading of S protein by the host serine protese TMPRSS2, an inhibitor under current study as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "ACE inhibitor use was associated with a substantial 34<0x25> decrease in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results are less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen filtration in piglets with disordered lipopolysaccharide acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect action (period) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases surrounding angiotensin II enhanced.
The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help relationship tracking in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("relationships") they may be in contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have already been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of the user's application.
Less disruptive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user proximity on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have ever had contact with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used across over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure with potentially infected people and provide quick feedback to healthcare authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the relationship tracking app is at an advanced stage of development, and will be available for launch in a few weeks. A similar app is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geolimits application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if application implementation is limited to only a fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related apps to its Apps Store, limiting them to only "powerful" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have done the same thing.
Privacy campaigners voiced their concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be halted as soon as the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement asking for a limit on such surveillance.
The organization has declared eight conditions on government projects:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> "responsibility, if necessary and in accordance with the law."
Further monitoring and supervision shall have an embedded clause;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and shown as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
to be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Meaningful involvement by all "relevant stakeholders" shall be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device's operating system as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have huge potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems have already been created that use centralized servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track relationships.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the merging of all these generates notices through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to major changes in information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany consider using a centralized system and privacy preservation.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Contact tracing with privacy preservation is a concept organized with important body of study literature starting from 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups are working for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and centralized approach, rather than a single protocol. The centralized protocol includes the centralized Privacy Maintenance Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, Event Number for FKA Contacts, CEN), and Privacy Sensitive Protocols
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using location or cross-sectional path data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar venture is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by several unified groups on important equal methods and large overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global usability for tracking and warning applications, an important aspect for achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had already made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for relationship tracking that they claim will preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy preservation cryptography.
They also publish specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to launch in three stages:
Launch of tools to enable the government to create a privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking application
The integration of this functionality directly into Google and Apple's iOS and Android plans to address the ongoing implementation and surveillance issues by first distributing the system through an operating system update, and then releasing it in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning a drug (also known as changing the purpose of a drug, re-profile, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or health condition from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the remedial plasma transfer. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 medicated proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofasfatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied a number of candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed for skeletal similarities with similarly-highly approved drugs to accelerate the development of strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in its preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial treatment that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of a Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment is not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in clinical studies.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when there is "no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chloroquine with a combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the use of hydroxychloroquine prevention.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median for 4 days, while the pain period was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In one study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is still lacking and early on.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its storage and use the military to send the drug to a university hospital, which would use the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe changed his stance against the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in the case of severe illness when the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no advantages can be observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV from mimicking by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There has been criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to change the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international trial of Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences went on to discover that Remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against various filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One issue with antiviral treatment is the indication of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials currently underway including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for the public with moderate disease and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials currently underway for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

Women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding or do not have effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centred study of 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium at a prophylactic and therapeutic dose was announced in Italy on April 14.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, sufficient scientific attention has been focused on the purpose of altering approved antiviral drugs developed for epidemic purposes such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th China guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th China guideline
Some antibiotics have been identified as potential goal modifiers as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there have been many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the Phase 1 safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The outbreak of the global pandemic in 2020, provides a proportionate investment and research activity to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Declared in April, the CEPI initiative's imperatives for the development of accelerated vaccines, manufacturing capacity, scaled implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platforms aiming to advance into Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 constructor and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I constructors and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials perform preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually at random, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining effective doses more accurately.
Stage III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are still not in human assessment) are still in "practical" research.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits in addition to their preventable diseases.
A randomized trial in Australia aimed at registering 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine is not safe or effective.
Preliminary research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, shows the need for level 3 biosafety measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no antidote or protective vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, no vaccine has been proven against MERS.
When MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Broadcasts on social media promote conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 is known and a vaccine is already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but may begin between two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between humans during close contact, often through small drops produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or over the surface rather than being infected for long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can stay on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and in the next stage of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by a real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves of carrying the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the ordinary public differ, with some authorities recommending not to use them, some recommending their use and others obliging their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or exhibit flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of anxiety include breathing difficulties, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish faces or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, upper respiratory glazing such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only data jams and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transplantation is still not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of those infected shows no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78<0x25>) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Swelling and saliva can carry a lot of virus loads.
It's easier to talk than to talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing does not cover the mouth can cause droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transfers are likely and that air collectors on positions in hallways outside of public rooms show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion into aerosols and in turn lead to congenital dispersal.
Although there is concern that it spreads through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says although it is not entirely clear about the spread of the disease, a person infects two to three people in general. The virus lasts for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus is found to be detectable for a day over cardboard, up to three days over plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours over 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products weaken the virus’s fat-protection layer, deactivating it and freeing it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) were less effective. In one Hong Kong study, examples of saliva were taken for the median for two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the enzyme-converting angiotensin (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
Viruses use a special surface of glycoprotein called "pepaku" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardium injuries were found in 12<0x25> of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe diseases.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms, due to systemic inflammatory response and diseases of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are very abundant in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High incidences of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor prognosis. Autopsies of those who died from COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocyte invasions containing inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2 expression epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells have been shown to correlate with the intake of inflammatory monocyte secretion IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic infestation was also reported during the autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
The results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (possibly detecting an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) are under development but not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy is only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first care start-up test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for infection detection based on clinical features and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral multilobar shattered glass oscillations with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions are common during early infection.
Dominants of the subpleura, many arapeutic (thickened septum thickening with multiple alveolus fillings) and unification may appear as the disease progresses.
Some data is available on monoscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung unification and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity for viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-between inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinucleic giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: damage of diffuse alveolus (DAD) with diffuse alveolus exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovering pneumonia: the preparation of exudates in the cavity of alveolus and space-between pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukoeritroblastic resection
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, regularly washing your hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the shoulder in the absence of tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after any coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit transfers by asymptomatic individuals. The social distancing strategy aims to reduce the relationship of infected people with large groups through the closure of schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The prison guideline is also included for people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away between them.
No drugs have been identified to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until at least 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as “swelling”.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating or after exhaling the nose, coughing or sneezing.
Again it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60<0x25> alcohol but only when soap and water are not available. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitizer, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
The public is managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves to be carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
ECMO membrane oxygenation is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese Health Commission have published recommendations to keep those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical carers and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) versus ibuprofen for first-line use.
Care should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals taking care of those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in the Infant Infection Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and innate precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipments are: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (versus face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved by industry settings but the FDA has already allowed masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect against innate particles such as dust but effective against specialized biological agents is not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face protection or as a final, homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentage do.
This type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flowing nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefits to the critically ill public is unknown.
Some doctors choose to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years old and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sharp increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospital admission.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical ventilator support and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, at least 30<0x25> of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators are able to control pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on ventilators for longer.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears as the most reliable.
While new drugs may take up to 2021 to develop, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers take part in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA provides temporary authorization for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in case for their lives are seriously or easily threatened.
It has not yet gone through the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app can detect "close identification" using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cellular phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and people they connect to in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data of their mobile phones with the coronavirus.
The measures are being taken to enforce quarantine and protect those in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's provincial health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40<0x25> of the people continue to move everywhere".
The German government runs a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for creative solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying. "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are the perfect thousands that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, similar to a common upper respiratory disease such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In many of those severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly degrade into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal clotting, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, was evident in as many as 6<0x25> of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4<0x25> of this group.
At least 20-30<0x25> of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days allotted for hospital admission.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In preliminary case studies, the median time from early symptom indication to death was 14 days, with a full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25> while women had a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolus damage with exudate cellular fibromisoids in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy are observed in pneumocytes.
Lung images show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with increased levels of troponin or cardium stalled.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with pre-existing health conditions, the availability of regional medical and socioeconomic resources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from different conditions due to their regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A low count of mild cases can lead to overestimation of the death rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by cases of infection in the past can mean the current death rate is overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term follow-up of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> reduction in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and a lung scan suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to syndrome after intensive care following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviors, but in the case with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for coronavirus at a previously reported date.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infection than with re-infection.
Viruses are considered to be natural and come from animals, through an overflow infection.
The exact origin is unknown but as of December 2019, the overall transmission of the infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest start date of symptoms was on December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
Some measures are usually used to measure mortality.
These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the duration since early transmission and characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection without laboratory-confirmation of clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death toll to global cases was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The amount varies by region. Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and conform to a specific population from infection to case settlement.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7<0x25>) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing lower mortality rates in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
Germany's health system is not over yet.
In the Netherlands, at least 3<0x25> may have antibodies as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for both men and women.
The higher mortality rate for men in the study was carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is that they are in their 50s, with the gap between men and women reaching the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are not known but genetic and behavioral factors may be the causes.
Immunological differences based on sex, a lack of smoking prevalence in women and men forming a joint morbid condition such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected individuals are men and 72<0x25> of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the time the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, in line with international recommendations for naming intended to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronaviruses" and "coronaviruses of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary names for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guidelines against the use of locations for diseases and viral names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital requires an immediate ventilator valve, and the supplier cannot deliver it on the required time scale, one engineering novice turns local and produces the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial transmission of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged in relation to the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly online.
Humans have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of impersonation of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being undertaken by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization started a "SOLIDARY Trial" to assess the effects of the current treatment of four antiviral compounds with the most reliable effectiveness.
No vaccine is available but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to develop the virus vaccine as a whole.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to obtain immediate immune response to the human body against new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system in some viral subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on the S-particle protein that helps the virus invade the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. Increased antibody dependence is proposed as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a controversy.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials currently underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials have already been approved as a treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-changed antiviral drugs cover much of China's research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir joining interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, gave preliminary results.
However, there is a call for an equivalent review of research.
The Korean and Chinese authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that double the dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating those infected with COVID-19. The 7th edition of China's guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to repel SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing low concentration inhibition on SARS-CoV-2. Studies show that early protein invasion by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together with or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further study. Oseltamivir does not in vitro disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Typhoon cytokines can be a complication in the next stage for severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has antisitokine storming properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is currently undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing a positive result with a severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this intends to counteract the development, which is thought to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome for different reasons, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of infectious and concentrated antibodies produced by their immune system recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tested on SARS with no conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action that allows passive antibody therapy to serve as a defensive mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as cellular cytotoxicity of antibody dependence and/or possible phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using the resulting monoclonal antibodies are under development.
The production of recovery serum, which consists of a portion of the blood fluid from the recovered patient and contains specific antibodies to the virus can be increased for faster execution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
