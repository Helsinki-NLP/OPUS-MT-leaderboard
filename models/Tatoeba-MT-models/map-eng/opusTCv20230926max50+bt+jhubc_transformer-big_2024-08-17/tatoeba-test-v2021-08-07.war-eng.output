You've got to be proud of me.
Call your mom right now.
I hope you didn't write that.
You're going to have to call it smug.
Let's say you're squeamish.
You have to be willing to bet that you're alone.
You still need help.
It's still chilling.
You didn't write, didn't even call.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
You have come down.
You've come down.
You won.
You won.
You're never going to make it.
You'll never do that.
You'll never do that.
You're never going to get it.
