Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned if they ‘look like puppet muppets'.
There was concern among some AMs over a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This came about due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM labor party said that its group was concerned, "The designation is the same as Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" towards the name change, but judged that this was an aberration of the MWP abbreviation being Muppet.
In this context the w in Welsh is pronounced like the u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for AMs is certainly a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 decision gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations over a proposal known to gain widespread support for referring to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of the AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/Welsh Members of Parliament), but the MWP option gained the most support at public consultations.
AM appears to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could dizzy chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to how the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AMs and the drafting of the committee system.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
The Macedonian people left to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
The owners of the vote will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour shows recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected EU and NATO membership offers.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, a protester of the vote for a name change, has said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are not ringing when the Churches in Harlem are in trouble.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adam said.
"Today, there's no one."
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
“People socialize in other ways” these days, he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it on a regular basis."
As well as the church, he feared that the money from asset sales would not last as long as the leaders expected, “and sooner or later they will return again from the start.”
Churches, he added, could have been replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the remaining holy places around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day on which these churches close simultaneously because it is impossible for those who move to these condominiums to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
A black church that has been worshipping in the surrounding area has taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they built the tower bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly called the bell the "Bell of the Poor"
An expert who rang the bells of the tower in July gave him another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing larger tower bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months is an elaborate story of architecture and contractors, some carried by lay church leaders, and others carried by Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, formed from lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to charge" on the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch a lobster in California in the opening event of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "realized" that the boy was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," Hammel said, realizing he had reached for the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where she was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area one week earlier, but that it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles is aware that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break down the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with convenience store-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push against the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty stalls will be trialled at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if that proves successful.
The investment in beauty became a hunting event for supermarkets to utilize shelves that used to be used as a place to display TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup suite so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly – something that young shoppers are increasingly in demand for.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching the purchase of daily food needs in small quantities at local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, has said that the stalls will increasingly look like Malls as supermarket chains try to fight back against pressurers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which it says has supported daily grocery sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchises, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, an alluring environment and a comfortable location signifying that we are currently an alluring destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'groaned' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left ‘in rage' after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11million lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby did not have time to manage the household appliances trademark and their accessories, Truly.
The pair's business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning, aged 37, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the star of Dragons" Den, Petes Jones angered by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business – to focus on her larger contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "grumpy" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their household appliances and accessories trademarks, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
One source said: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
That would be his long-term future, which would keep him for decades to come.
His decision to step down made everyone involved really dumbfounded.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to the time of launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of the UK’s most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to huge investments in the form of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home fixtures, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-established friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We're not going to comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously ‘and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some consider "non-presidential" and have been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a taunting voice of his "newsreader".
"I didn't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at keeping pressure down.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping the rocket experiment, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unorthodox approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Kill Hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is homeless, there is no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing in international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, then this is somewhat challenging," said Bu Sumbung.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the pitch.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the continuous earth shaking experienced by Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the danger warnings already being reported, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
In the best of times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The floating hospital that has been stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure at the heart of the election campaign, and he has spent money on highway and rail construction.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko’s government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Muslim and Christian hordes fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from outside Chelsea when his side were 1-0 down.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards a distant pole.
The ball soars high over the goal when the ball soars into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and the players like Shaq always played it forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just take a kick."
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the first half after Belgium's mainstay Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave Mateo Kovacic feedback on the game, before spinning near midfield and running fast into the central part of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave a pass and ran in midfield.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards goal.
Hazard made it past the opposing defender and kicked the ball into the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude Richter earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is filled with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I ask everyone who is around John's road in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on dashboard cameras to contact us because they may have information important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead resident and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of notifying the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he found out what had happened.
Residents are currently being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being put into place as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He always repeated ‘this is terrible'.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in the line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, phone 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by citing log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue became the last memorial to be affected by ‘historical rewrites'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts perpetrated by fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that difference.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pigs Persecute Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a pig stable in a market area of Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of a nearby pig stable had opened.
He said that in the pig pen there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that the 550-pound male had persecuted the breeder to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's calves are bleeding and broken," the cousin, known as "Wu", was quoted as saying by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife frightened him and drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the scent of blood could act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing around.
They're biting, very curious... they're not going to come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of storm Rosa brought heavy rain extending into the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over colder waters off Mexico's northern coast.
After all, Rosa will cause flooding across the northern and southwestern regions of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, starting at 5 a.m. Sunday Eastern Region time, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Trench began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flash floods are likely to occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the nature of the scattered tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the gorge to become a violent river and storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rains to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to drain and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an exact example of a dramatic temperature difference along the central U.S. region on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and re-spread.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. region is expected to warm up starting in October with speeds spreading by as much as 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is expected to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to report on an unexpected incident in the final minutes of Friday: A deal devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh groped her body in a drunken stupor and tried to take her clothes off at a High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it was not the case.
There are likely more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks broadcasting this were not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually had difficulty in counting the number of people who witnessed it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is a viewership number that is almost the same as a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, outperformed all networks by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shouted at by protesters when he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was maki-caught, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have the power when there are many helpless women.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake has been reassured in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh in the absence of an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, Sept. 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called Chequers' plans for Brexit, saying that the proposal on Britain and the EU having to collect tariffs on each other was "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect on fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said that he confessed to having carried out a fatal shooting against Wayde.
His contract has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and surrounding residents in assisting with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the region's law enforcement for "persistence and the quest for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet lived in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
''This is what you worry about all the time,'' said Wade.
Volcanoes spew ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and listed 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitors several rumbling and vibrations.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of a car in the neighborhood of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and when thousands joined rival rallies to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police pelted them with eggs and threw powder paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that tourists would normally fill.
The dispute also occurred later that day with police using their wands to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" confronting union protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after an October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, despite low voter turnout in the presence of those opposed to secession and most boycotting elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take different routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to choose, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital victory despite a slight regional election last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, over their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with her cell phone in support of police, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned pre-trial since late last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his post as Ibrox club manager, for his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side's move is on par with Hibernian's second.
Gerrard’s side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, while head coach Holt still trailed defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lose chances against sloppy guest team
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy which gave the Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt missed across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and dealing with Craig Halkett's header from across the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play ahead at the start, knowing that they could make it difficult for the entrants to get the ball dead.
And that’s the way to produce a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to help Menga, who got the turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the possession but realized that the home defence was impenetrable and overall goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unimpressed,
That pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was stumped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was knocked away by Livingston's other game tactics.
Attacks continued to come into Livingston's net and were constantly unavoidable, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
The ‘phenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and results were phenomenal for Livingston.
For a man, they are incredible, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-rising trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have hardly changed since they returned to the top flight, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard during the game.
Despite this, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less than good - only once they could break up the home side's formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the pitch.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a stretch of blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They argued over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks located outside of Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests depict opposition to the presence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced as a dictator by others.
Deptford highway collision: Bicyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and bus lanes were diverted and motorists were urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six of the guards were injured in a riot in the men's prison with strict guard, the outpost office stated.
Chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been deployed to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained undercover officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is going on at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot officers were called to jail to deal with a serious riot in which an undercover officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Floods (Dry Area May Benefit)
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that is likely to occur early next week as the remaining energy footprint of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, raising the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service issued warnings of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to drive directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting on Monday night accompanied by rain.
The National weather service in Phoenix said on Twitter that there were only "ten tropical cyclones capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status in 200 miles of Phoenix territory since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center Exercise tool is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are most likely exposed to 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in flood-free areas, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be beneficial because the southwest region is currently experiencing drought.
According to U.S. drought watchers, only about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced the least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the path taken by Hurricane Rosa leads to land across Baja California on the Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakened its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is estimated to have hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern Sonora region, possibly rising to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross the northern section along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by midnight Tuesday.
"The main risk that Rosa or its remnants may pose is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. region southwest of the U.S. desert." The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rains are expected to cause a threat of flash floods and debris of buildings flowing into the wilderness, and landslides in mountainous regions.
Norton Midsomer attack: arrest of four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset regions, police said.
Officers have been calling on anyone who may have video footage of the incident on his phone to come report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘accepts the hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful ploy," Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from Democrats during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage on that day.
"A vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold someone who has the most perfect legal thinking of our time, a jury with a track record of true public servants," he told a West Virginia support crowd.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
“That’s why I went there and here, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "fight and block."
The first procedural vote at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be held at the latest Friday, an aide of senior GOP leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away as giant waves hit the coast, as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying anything it passed through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, timbers, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centres in Palu.
Air photos released by BNPB showed many destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent aftershocks shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
A string of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The BPPT said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of a tsunami, it can be said to be so.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication “is completely paralyzed by the absence of information from Donggala,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading for the disaster-affected region.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The agency received much criticism on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the wave had already hit at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur recording shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building shouting a warning in panic of an approaching tsunami, towards people on the streets below.
Within minutes a roll of water hit the beach, knocking out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami were the biggest cause of power outages that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has already reopened only to channel aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami death toll has risen to over 800.
That's horrible.
As World Vision employees from Donggala have made it to safety in the city of Palu, where they have taken shelter in a tarpaulin tent built in their office yard, on their way through various devastated areas, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's awful.
Even as aid groups began to move slowly to begin disaster relief activities, some of the groups complained of deterrence against foreign volunteers with expertise, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, relief of goods and power from abroad can only begin to be channeled if the area affected by the disaster has been officially declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the moment the Government says, OKE, this is a national disaster," we can accept International aid, but there is no such status yet."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will fix the bleak storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the got.
On Sunday, rescuers took out a woman who had been stuck under rubble for two days with the mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has coached two missing paragliding athletes, who took part in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how after news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel circulating around the paragliding community, in desperation he sent WhatsApp messages to competitors Palu, who participated in the celebrations at the beach.
However, all the messages received only one grey tick, not two blue ticks.
"I think that means the message was not sent," he said.
Robbers take <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging in Newport on Levee
The robber on Friday morning, stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM machine storage box in Newport, according to news from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was at work, another man "runs from behind the workers of Brink" and steals one bag containing money to be sent.
Witnesses saw some of the suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “What used to be formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had already had the nickname Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes were made ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, as she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the show's creators said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
“I believe ‘ye’ is a commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with broadcaster Radio Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, that name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true selves."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a connecting sign and a Great letter.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody countermeasures against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops opened fire on peaceful demonstration activities on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when left-wing student movements instilled its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by subsidizing monthly for those who are in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should have doubled A.I. funding.
Because China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding it will use for research in the field, said investor and practitioner A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who already works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even as the U.S. overall lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Preserving AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to lag far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI," Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the odds so that the next big AI milestone will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview on Sunday.
Lea, the owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is already investing in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology rivalries such as the Robotics Challenge for a state-of-the-art Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It wasn’t China that took the academic lead; it was the company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university figures for AI research in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD degree holders in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other governmental organizations hand out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic assignments is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA (the state-of-the-art Defense Research Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, recently DARPA invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
The Macedonian people cast a vote in order to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to decide the country's name change to "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bid to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June under a new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identity of most of Macedonia's ethnic Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not cast his vote at the general election and a boycott campaign had cast doubt on whether the election results could reach the minimum number of votes needed for the election results to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain entry into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, quite a few lawmakers have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko give their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to rename the country which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join in Strumica, Macedonia, Sept. 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov had already prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join honourably, not through the door of servants", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will approve of it because more than 80 percent of our people support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after delivering his ballot.
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the number needed.
Another poll, organized by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure to vote would represent the first policy rejection of the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scoured the entire Brighton defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the match.
He ran among Brighton's three-man defenders, before recklessly entering the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four men in green shirts.
He spun past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of the Brighton goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward took advantage of his first kick from goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero struggled with some problems at his feet," Pep Guardiola manager City told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League bout.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside Brighton on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning away kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a bit of a screeching ball before leading Sterling to the furthest post.
The Sky Blue forward dribbled in the direction of the goal just before the ball slid out of the border.
City play Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to pit spoilers against Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff game, there was no more reason to impose another game.
But an overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outshine the Colorado Rockies in Sunday’s game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot after winning a wild-card match against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still struggling for their first division title.
"Even if we play without winning, we can at least know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowds and other teams that will compete at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?”
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who is set to start the game for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and started Sunday’s game which is usually used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher was an 18-7 scorer with a 2.53 run average (ERA) and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president implicitly refers to the situation that concerns his choice of future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he talks about the importance of the Republican vote in mid-election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an incredible candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a radically-horrible Democratic group, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their evil, their abominations.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to fight to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He was referring to Senate Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying her name, which was met with loud slurs from her listeners.
"Remember what the answer was?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service venue.
Now be intolerant to anyone who makes up his mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce myself, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our attendance was not expected - all because we were expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the censure movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn to previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the workers of east Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed it ever began.
Differences in opinion in the workers' party are increasingly clearly not tolerated and every opinion is judged on its merits by the party's authority.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who I had thought would share the same political views, began to expect me to back and accept a position that I would never accept – both in the national security and the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then there will be a sneer on social media calling for the cancellation of the appointment, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn’t have served in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Sure, I knew that I was luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tended to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today’s political era is how much abuse has been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labor party was supposed to help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on a wider church and with every "no confidence" motion or change the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not to voice my opinion too much, and then I would say "okay."
But I’m not into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as local counselors and ministers in government.
I never hid my political action, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things I disagree with in the current leadership.
For those who are advocating a motion on Friday, all I can say is that as the country moves swiftly towards a split in sovereignty (Brexit), it will jeopardize our state business and public service, I don’t want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the Labour party leader.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr rises to the top position
The last two tries may have slightly rigged the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
Now that they were at the top, the only undefeated party out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to grab the best chances, earned the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Appreciation for Ayr, they’re better at taking chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given to that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot compromised the unconverted try.
Climo eased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in mid-time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's converted try by Baggot, reduced the chances to five points.
Then there was a long pause as Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injuries, was stretchered out, and since the restart of the match, Ayr drove faster beyond Stafford McDowall's trial attempt, converted by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then hit by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with Bruce Colvine's unconverted try, at the end of the hard pressure.
The hosts had returned to play, but, as Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for circumnavigating Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured forward Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked a goal and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
Still Game star looks set to embark on his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks ready to move on to the service industry after it was discovered that he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis was cast on the BBC’s popular show, which he directed and also starred alongside his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair had already announced that the upcoming ninth series was the final episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours: Bolivia is surrounded by land hoping that the courts will re-open the path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrolled at the launch force headquarters located at La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Naval Base from Titicaca to the Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing Bolivia surrounded by land, the memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid – like a desire to once again wade through the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly positive expectations about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on screen across the country, hoping that a court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of tense negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a guarantee of Bolivia's sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial war for re-election next year - also had much support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's will- and that it will change little if that is possible.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to cede Chilean territory, and has already determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated the case was "not complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international legal expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may have suffered a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has undermined the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain in talks, but it will be very difficult to remain in discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's government representative in The Hague rejected the idea of decision-making quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales—still one of Latin America's most famous presidents—used maritime issues as a political backer.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see if we need to resolve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country's first would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned about the United States implementing an agreement made at the time of a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen nearly embarking on a nuclear diplomacy that has been deadlocked for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just a "future dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean War settlement declaration would make North Korea surrender.
Washington is on the alert to agree to the declaration in the absence of Pyongyang making efforts to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the arsenal that for the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show showcases a wealth of the latest collection of headscarves all the way to the main street near you.
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from the sun don’t look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne put out a series of large size head coverings for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
A completely impractical hat has already swept Instagram this summer and these designers have already unveiled eye-catching creations on the stage of the show.
What stands out from Valentino is a cream-coloured hat on which is decorated with a wide fringe of fur tubs that cover the head of the model.
Large size accessories include diamond-adorned watermelons, witch hats and even a pineapple, but are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a bunch of weird-and-precise masks ahead of Halloween.
Many different color masks whose lips have been sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A scuba diving-like creation is equipped with snorkels and eyeglasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep browsing those great fashion collections – then you’re in luck.
Fashion watchers estimate that such a large collection of hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large-sized hats became a very popular trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a rim two feet wide was seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a hat that was so impractical the splash of social media made a huge creation on the beach catwalk-bags of straws that were about the same size as swimsuits – worn with a sling model.
The burnt orange rafia bag, cut with rafia on the edge with a white handle rope, is a standout from the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing the big hat and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer – as the designers are already making a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding exam results, which are further strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, the arts, music as well as hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best services for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their role as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be popular and desirable elective subjects in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go to his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your speech will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest passing marks in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who study a foreign language get an A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students earned an A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also got an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
Today the languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that of several reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the growing number of job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are important in a globalized world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents from foreign countries will automatically make a multilingualist superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French became the only language spoken in a two-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for today.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with a developing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important in English for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be considered an "international communication skill."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teenagers.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's General Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including a stop at several fun spots that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was postponed so he could elect a Supreme Court nominee, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote was cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is getting tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and Senate vote estimates are due to be delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the rally is to help the Republican party gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign mentioned that the five meetings this week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
“Control of congress is so important to his agenda that the president will as much as possible travel to the states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight is expected to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an attempt to increase his gains in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political expert at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to keep its hopes in the face of Sunday’s single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of momentum pendulum is a sporting concept that is the result of findings that are completely trusted by the players, and nothing more than in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“Before, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we took that as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Certainly Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be spirited, not to mention the formations of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and boasted three of the four points each.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and led by example.
The celebratory yell grew louder as his turn came, taking a crucial putting blow to make the series match as he and Thomas lost two to two.
The putting punch from him that won them at number 15 was greeted with a similar shout, a scream that tells you that he is sure America is not losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have left now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed tale of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting pair of Europeans are four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd that assures that they are a player to beat on Sunday, and no player more famous than neither Fleetwood nor Molinari will lock in a potential European win at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine is like digging a hole that these Spanish and Swedish golfers will never be able to climb.
Although, on Sunday nothing can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursomes are a great show to take a closer look at because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and led far enough into the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had the guts to compete despite doubts by some, especially in the United States.
Europe top 10-6 on last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rising from Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain a trophy he didn’t have in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side who were wrong in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single game to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to beat the splattered Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he has already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting at morning fourball, then returned to pair up with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2<0x26>1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it alone despite the pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2<0x26>1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice has it happened in Ryder Cup history where a team returning from a four-point deficit goes into a single game, though as the defending champion Furyk team only needs a series point to retain the trophy.
However, having been second best for two days, Sunday's counter-attack looked like it would surpass them.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations about the sanctions that continue to deepen their distrust of the United States and that it is unlikely that the country would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, he made a significant statement that they did not reject it completely as Pyongyang had in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and the first-ever North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to work on "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea's security guarantees.
North Korea had wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the pressure by imposing semi-imposed sanctions on achieving their objectives by force, and even rejects the "final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could get us on our knees is an illusion of people not knowing about us.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the United States leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the troubled side in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not reach this kind of a dead end.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after Trump’s “Devil President” called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea in total, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but the big work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If this takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue unequivocally and must not fail until we learn that denuclearization is complete, final and verified.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea in a matter of hours invaded that he made "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim had told him to take "appropriate actions" to his liking was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year put all the high school students there to sleep more, in an effort to counter macho culture in the growing learning through the caffeine-powered 'owl man'.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know anything about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
She was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I just being told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The first course, launched this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of a dormitory room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic outcomes were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of bedtime routines.
In other sections, participants were able to explain how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just as you do have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health.”
A proud culture of ‘instantaneous’ still exists, he said, plus that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was an ever-expanding problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate a mode of hunger, giving rise to a sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident studying chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students are instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting a sleep alarm, as well as a wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effects of the ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its set path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrard's team's mental loss
Again, the Rangers felt the grief of the day away as Dolly Menga's attack ushered Steven Gerrard's disintegrating side in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side have struggled to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side have just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Mena attacked seven minutes before the first half was over and the out-of-control Rangers didn’t seem to compensate.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind the goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers' camp after line guard Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with a costume that amazes their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the ball they had.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder drew the big chance too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free-kick then met captain Craig Halkett but his defenceman Alan Lithgow could only punt wide in the back position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had almost never had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be counter to the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved it due to their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep deadball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained quiet picking Menga for the sake of a simple end.
Gerrard acted on the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch was almost immediate as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressively quickly came out of line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to force away teams to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team should have widened their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from a corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he was at odds with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his head.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger numbering
And now from the pages of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and STILL WILL BE GIVEN...the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the device being referred to as Geiger's Deception.
Being the mainstay of science since then, the Geiger Deception has also been a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Scatter, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When using these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, it must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘recognise’ evil cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'recognise' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from a patient, transforming them in a laboratory
They can then 'recognize' proteins that are common in many cancers and then be injected again.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
One woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting a patient’s immune cells, turning them in the laboratory so that they can “recognise” the proteins commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Starts Diatribe Pro-Trump, Wears MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
Not walking well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town in which he wears the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's prank was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock is trying to make fun of West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage due to the hat being worn.
"They bumped me in the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're tripping me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the place sink?” saying that he’s going to wear Superman robes, because this means you can’t dictate what I have to do. You want the world to go forward?
Try to love."
His comments generated scorn at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person informing: "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the ex-boyfriend of rapper Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confused many people with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like the Perrier Bottle.
West had the support of TPUSA's conservative leader Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BUILDING THE PEOPLE."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's really very nice."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spews out dangerous ideologies for my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, known also as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the late music legend Prince, changing his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for swinging swords in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, refutes the stereotype of macho heroes, he says that roles on such screens make teenage boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something is wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of poor masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her co-star in Rose Leslie's Game of Thrones, also 31, said she felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
"I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?," he said.
'What do we teach men as we grow up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may have been responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Where is the character from birth and what is it taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be boys?
I think that's really one of the big questions of this time - how do we change it?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he will not play in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series will end next summer, saying that he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November Kit will star in the return of Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life begins," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit character Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's home ground in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> spike in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> surge in the number of its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has become increasingly prevalent.
Due to the country's conservative value, the study estimates that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
United States Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had submitted personal information of three United States Republican senators to the MP's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the U.S. Senator's home address and telephone number, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by strangers on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual abuse against future Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the shipment was connected to Waters' office and exposed information of one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened as a result of fraudulent and false allegations - are not at all responsible for this information leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This protest means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they don't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't deviate.
They cannot question the accuser's motives.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters to a part-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Water said his office had warned "the proper authorities and law enforcement entities regarding this false allegation.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions to one and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again review – poor spy parody Rowan Atkinson
Now looking at the significance of Brexit in every new film with a British biased view is already a tradition and that seems to apply to the resurgence of Johnny English's action-comedy parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm insinuate about how clearly bad we are becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
However, the glaring, rubber-faced and incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up for the second time – his name hints more than anything else that he is a vast comic creation designed for a region of language cinema other than English.
Surely he is a mad secret agent who, despite his bizarre conjectures, has little character Clouseau, a handful of Mr Bean characters and a handful of wanderers who contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In fact, he is indeed based on the mysterious international traveler and man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving chaos behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor and a rotor propeller quickly attaches to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt underpowered and too bizarre, especially when film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
The humor felt as if it was aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the various odd Johnny English misadventures weren’t as innovative and as focused as Atkinson’s movie-busting jokes in Bean’s personality.
The premise that has been warming for years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web, uncovering the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the on-duty agent – unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, who has already ruined his total political popularity: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but there is not much to be done with the script.
His intelligent advisor provides information that since any active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, is now employed as a principal in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to conduct undercover operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy academies like the School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, wedded to a submarine commander, the infuriating role of high-class woman in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin who made a mistake on Her Majesty's Secret Agent return to action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister alarmingly falls under the influence of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their silly adventures: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury ship; and English triggers anarchy when she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize herself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn to the final sequence, but with such hospitality and commotion, there are few children's TV channels that contain everything.
Quite a moderate thing.
And like any other Johnny English film, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits her talent?
Labor denies it is drafting a plan for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but be paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union is considering a radical plan that wants British citizens to work four days a week – but is paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company's owners to pass on savings through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra days off.
He would let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get paid the same.
Some sources said that the idea would 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and plans encouraging the country to support the workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the UK Trade Congress as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A senior Labor Union source told The Sunday Times: “A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that fits the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy that supports workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor conference to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘catchers' at utility companies.
This shadow chancellor plan also means, the current shareholder in the drinking water company will probably not regain its entire stake because the government of the Labour party can conduct a 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also confirmed his plans to put the workers on the company's board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which would pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their mind.
It seems that Kennedy is more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the accusation came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He is a firm, determined, determined man."
However, it seems like Graham's voice will not be able to be changed.
“My mind has made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett denied it out loud," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name couldn't verify it.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is Global Citizens Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a row of stars performing very impressively, and a mission that is also memorable; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of this event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen over the past 12 years been in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving free concerts the right way to get people to do something, or is it just another case of “clicktivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It said this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will impact more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has accumulated 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which have been channeled or funded.
The group estimates safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executors committed to "helping children grow to their fullest potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on the Common Question on their website that asks "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e were among the stars performing at this year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as a "blockade" to curb Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for naval help to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - was a pretext to explore the new energy market.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just as they do in eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to conduct blockades, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke before the attendees of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He compared the approach Washington took in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, utilizing and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as representatives of the Trump administration are on a mission to boost their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin has denied that Washington’s tough resistance to the project is solely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I will face a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Watch the Situation" While Running for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "observe the situation" while running for president after the midterm election.
While campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dilapidated government, including putting women at the top," he told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a look at the situation while running for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the city hall, saying that he was "carrying this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said senators should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32<0x25> voted in favor of the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide it in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
“What my son is going through, what he’s going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have suffered,” he said before an audience present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like "an elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who was a violent gang member" had harassed him, but U.S. officials refused his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum applicants for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy contradicts a 2014 Immigrant Appeals Council decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "disregards state, federal, and international laws that have been around for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such prohibitions violate principles," the court brief said.
Further the prosecutors gave a brief opinion that the policy of refusing immigrant entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that it was likely they would become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups, or political opinions," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt in Palu as the victims double as they race with time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby boy who was in demand at a refugee centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking items submerged in water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalised, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude quake, was extremely chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
Tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the quake rocked the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There is no chance of saving yourself.
I think I’m stuck in the rubble of a wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family were in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I don't know her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily calling the U.S.-China trade reciprocal advantage, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily paid supplement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an allegation China denied.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marks what U.S. officials have told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington’s increased campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently shackled in a growing trade war, leading them to raise rates of import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and businesses in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion on the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling that intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government capitalizes on the tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom that is highly valued in America by loading paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in street newspaper vendors' stalls here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the actual reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic trajectory, given the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media outlets turned down an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warned Republicans Keep Women Voters Ahead of Part-Time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
As Republicans stand up and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, at the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions over the matter were very high, and most Republicans on record already indicated that they wanted to move forward on the vote.
It was inevitable," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) drive at the final minutes to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger at voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate hallway as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to continue advancing in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democracy's enthusiasm and motivation will come off the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news website.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony that detailed sexual abuse of him by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts advised there would be a counter-attack that would follow if Republicans continued to push him forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the selection of committees or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans are likely to be torn about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the choice being a little more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they do or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or may have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh who was drunk had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said the future Supreme Court chief had shown his cock to him while they were attending a party while they were at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Founder Plans to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about this private online data storage is that it really is up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In companies it is known as “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of founding Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to present the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of coder volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models will actually be reversed overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy and a commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the neutrality of the network debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for attacks on the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never learned that he had won the highest British military honors.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a stone of "intelligence symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "penetrating a very thick fog under a barrage of fire from field guns and machinery."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field guns alone and disabling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I wouldn’t be able to live but were a very humble act.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very flattered to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night watching the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The San Jose bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up until the early hours of the day specifically for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke."
"It's a government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content was not suitable for airing, so it was replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
"In my opinion, if we think about replays, I think we might be able to get it done," Coker said.
"But right now it's six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, there was a lot of text going back and forth and everything was not educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We’ll cut to five fights out of six — as we usually do — and we’ll try to avoid excessive screening for fans, and we did it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low self' over sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem due to his sexuality issues – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said, she spoke of the right of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the people who were eliminated on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" all the others who grew up with her because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
“To this day, that feeling is less than the others, and that feeling is different, has become the real things that give me the power and strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has been a well-known LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries from discrimination against homosexuals.
She said she spoke because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "shocked me."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, and said the age gap was not an issue.
"When you had so many problems at a very young age" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who was experiencing the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had already got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you're not going to sit in the front row dad'," he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing and still hadn’t really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of people at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first choice of songs – Proud by Heather Small – which had already fused with her in her preparations for the Olympics and still made her goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson has changed his role at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to switch roles to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to set a record for the 12th time, was backed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a group four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the five-time top winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that range, hoping to fix what has troubled him.
Never been the straightest golf bat even though at the height of his career, this 48-year-old was not fit to take a very rigorous course at Le Golf National, which routinely gave long and rough penalties for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it’s not scary enough for Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, to face the highly accurate English Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson’s game proved to be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, patted his back and hugged me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is a Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
I can’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that’s how we play and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy the other atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career that would never equal the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players are having fun with him, this week as well, which is quite fun to see.
He gave a lot of things, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from experience that someone who led big enough towards his last single match in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant ride.
Dane made his first debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but having just touched the finish line with their noses by the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big lead at Valderrama; we get a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just now," Bjorn said, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It’s not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve said for a long time that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players playing on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never go forward on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your full potential as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to pass on to all the players, getting the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of her."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the final day of the big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending in a defeat as Europe performed a “Miracle in Medina.”
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together towards the final day.
“We’ve got 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you can see at Brookline, as you can see at Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we are trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players at the top.
“I went with this group of people in this sort of order because I think I could close all the way,” Bjorn said of his single choice.
New German warships rescheduled
The latest German naval escort ship should have gone into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warship, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the faulty system and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already booked by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the aging Bremen-class escort ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar erasers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of care - it should be possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from her home port.
However, the constant delay means this advanced warship – which is said to allow Germany to show off its powers abroad – will be obsolete by the time it begins to enter its duties, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 escort ship made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned ships to shipbuilders after delivery.
Few known reasons behind the ship's return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen-class warships.
It was also found that the ship's weight was excessive which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - was also a problem.
It said it rose surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - up from its initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue surrounding the new escort ship became particularly important given the latest warning because of the depreciation of German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ship with the ability to deploy."
The official said over time the problem grew bigger, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats secretly
New research is being done on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to uncover how bats use landscapes in their food hunt.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on this unique behavior of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common pipistrelle and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound expert who analyzes all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with detailed landscape scales about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are derived from habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind and lighting turbines also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats as well as chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bat is not blind.
However, due to its habit of hunting at night, its ears are more useful than its eyes in terms of catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to locate insects appropriately and barriers in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, cares deeply about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland on the Threadeve estates at Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Plantation manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
"Here at Threadeve, we've got a good area for the bats," he said.
“We’ve got old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so, the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of vetting bats before carrying out maintenance within the property, as there was an unwitting possibility of the destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats, which would probably annihilate the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't yet know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo who rejected rape claims is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him "fake news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegation.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid him <0x24>375,000 to keep his mouth shut over this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
All they say today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy guy and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, which they call "reports of suspicion in the realm of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would request compensation as "a moral indemnity in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to reports filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 per cent" he was a "good guy" who was disappointing was only "one per cent."
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had performed a visum on her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because she felt "fear of getting revenge" and was worried "would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she was now seeking to cancel the peace settlement because she was constantly traumatized over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain ‘will regret forever’ over loss of automakers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, the UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays if there is no deal would hurt Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which makes Auris and Avensis Toyota production - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90<0x25> were exported across the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a halt in production at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed their concerns regarding leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers are saying is supply chain risk if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the principle of "just in time" production, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company’s representative said, and production would thus be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May’s plans for future ties with the EU were “exactly calibrated to avoid border checks.”
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof is not only from Toyota alone but other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what is already a very good supply chain.”
Toyota cannot say how long its production will be halted, but that is clear in the long run, warning that the added costs will reduce the plant's competitiveness and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union manager at the plant, said its members were becoming more and more worried: "In my experience, once this job is done, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "responsible in another week" as the fight for Supreme Court presidential candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, as well as the potential for obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with a Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claim against Kavanaugh, which went on to delay a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be that within this week, I can see that rewinding it to another week is good as well given the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But let's just see and I always want to get the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said the rare meeting was not out of dislike for TV reporters "who were trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I don't agree with the fact that they were trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
“The president did more direct question-and-answer sessions than the previous president,” he said, adding without mentioning evidence: “We’ve seen those numbers.”
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, however "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly asks questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting top officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show his reasons, making a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before reporters gather.
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers in NHS Scotland on concerns over Brexit issues
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still work here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the cost of filing a permanent status for EU citizens working in the transferred public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching a decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That's why I want to reaffirm now how much I appreciate the contributions of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
The coach and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no detail yet about the type/level of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted sophomore, was in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before dropping out of the game, which brought his total tackles during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher seal when they purchase a property in the UK, along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to the new Tory plan.
This move will restrain the success rate of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters
This stamping fee increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase properties in the UK – along with additional money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to restrain the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
The rise in seal costs will be imposed on individuals and companies that don’t pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that drives the Government’s efforts to combat vagrants.
Additional costs – which are additional costs on the current cost of sealants, including higher levels introduced two years ago on the purchase of a second home and the purchase of a home for rent – could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this movement to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, which led to price increases and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the rich areas of the country - usually in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to fix "housing hazards" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including rental supervision and an end to "guilty-free" evictions.
He also wanted to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our dilapidated housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy a home as easily as a UK resident who is already working hard.
For many people the dream of owning a house becomes something very far away, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "major ambition" was to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it," Ross told Sportound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it has always been something that drew me back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland's managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he had no qualms about following in the footsteps of big names at the club as big as that, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that exist at this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I’ll probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there.”
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and turned St Mirren from relegation to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through," he recalled while taking over Alloa.
"I'm absolutely sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m doing well, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
You have a lot of things to go through each week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

The survey found that the right time to drink beer was 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted UK pubs’ revenue that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Figures show pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: “The sun is shining brightly and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup means that July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard hit.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June will worsen in July.
Pubs and bars that sell drinks are by far the strongest in comparison to what happens in restaurants that go down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, although it is not as severe as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just going out for drinks.
Sales across managed pubs and bars that sell beverages rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreation and hospitality analyst said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and the impact of a major social event or sporting event remain the biggest factor concerning the sale of the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year would be painfully above the ongoing cost pressures.
A long summer shouldn’t come at a time when operators selling food are having bad times, and time will tell if the good enough temperatures we’ve been enjoying in August will provide the little rest we need.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown at the brand's launch.

One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children – some of whom are still 11 years old – have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals development of "Fake Instagram" page
This news has raised concerns about sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show to parents
One in five children – some of whom are still 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a “fake Instagram” account – a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a cleared “primary” account to show parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the "Men's Principal Conference" as well as the "Women's Principal" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
Head of HMC, Mike Buchanan said: “This is disturbing so many teenage children are trying to create an online space that parents and their teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his various experiences at the international level over the past few decades.
“Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world’s athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I look forward to being able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals in total and is now an expert on the BBC, is now unable to walk after an ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent his recovery was.
It’s a very tiring job to get back to full recovery, relearn how to walk, and today do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows have split opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has split opinions online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world’s first “silent-wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by a humorous music video to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four mothers danced in a barn filled with cow straw following a song that included lyrics such as: "Yes, I blushed myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it's not a broom, this is my breast."
It continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them darling, pump out, pump out, I milk my lady."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it made "terrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like we do, cows should also get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within days of giving birth.”

Another comment: “Understood trauma is good for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to look after the baby?"
Another added: "An ad that lost meaning."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Rice makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy but I accepted it as it is.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who are blackmailing (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cows."
This is not a complimentary or judgmental advertisement for the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel dancing with a hidden pump tucked inside their bra.
The basis of this campaign concept comes from the insights of many women who are breast-feeding who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without cables or tubes and fits inside the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched convincingly and provocatively.
By equalizing the image between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump breast milk and all its challenges, and showing it through the way of entertaining and pleasing with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Are Moving Silently to Tents at Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children is increasing despite monthly border crossings still being unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that complicate childcare with sponsorship.
Essentially, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor displaced minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsor societies are in this country illegally, and most of them are bad strangers.
That’s why we continue to hunt those people,” Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which had become the standard before, shelter workers said.
Most of them appear via video conferencing calls, not directly, to plead their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those who are considered unfit for assistance will be immediately deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, said shelter workers and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is mounting in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are on a struggling child likely to be ignored because of its size.
They say that moving children to the campground without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma that has been fought so much.
Syria has called on ‘invading forces’ from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil, arguing against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without making any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He stressed that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” of terror groups and “the presence of illegal foreign soldiers.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees’ problems, Moualem insisted they should return soon, and he blamed “several western countries” for “spreading overwhelming fear” that prompted the refugees to move further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a full-fledged humanitarian problem.”
The European Union and the United States have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has resulted in an opportunity to resume political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem insisted that the agreement had a "clear timeline" and suggested that military action would target mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be wiped out."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way to a general election.
Moualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the current articles of the Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to the logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecution and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubted, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's lead hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable TV rankings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the eve of the headlines.
“It’s a spirit that attracts people because it’s something that’s not yet understood,” said Neal Baer, host of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who became president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump his vote.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There is a sense of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
Switching from that, a luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Even so, it’s not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock that you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of the “background” source for his book “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 (“thick clothing with arrogance,” The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ horrific description of Anato Trump.
This time, I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of the policy he’s doing makes him just like a reality show that entertains you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s daily show scenes and storylines (choosing hostility to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You won’t miss or miss a single episode.

He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and subsequently the Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

Much of the money from the outside flooded the most stringent part-time election competition in the White House
Naturally Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to a reorganization of the congressional district that offered two incumbents the same seat.
The recently redistricted district of Pittsburg filed with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb — who won seats in other districts in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlaps with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in large campaign funds between the finance side of the major party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election that was monitored publicly for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts are leading the Democratic party a little better.
U.S. Considers Giving El Salvador Penalty for Supporting China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats have confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognize Beijing, putting little pressure on Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until a partner ousted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties are only considered against El Salvador, which has received about <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and the economy.
The proposed punishment, which includes cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and rising rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top government officials confirmed they wanted the conference to resume, effectively ending sentencing considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the government's imports at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new harsh rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the unclear circumstances.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about these unclear circumstances.
Study Story
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller's special counsel's report on possible obstruction of justice Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very important evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller’s report also discusses his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held to account for himself, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
So there’s still a lot to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s administration is inevitable – or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in avoiding the years of massacres that followed.
The beginnings of history centred along such a point of deviation, and an accelerated or postponed march of democracy was inevitable.
Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the one who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and arguing that he was unfit to serve as president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was incorrect.
“How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair – or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote on a part-time basis for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
Yet I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feeling optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to a bigger goal.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we are sure we can get something and go by pocketing a point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they might have performed better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
On Thursday, it’s another big day in Europe.
We hope to bag three points even though it will be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but, with the back-up of the fans, I believe we can go forward and get a positive result.
In the last year, we had a difficult time, because of my injury and the changes at the club itself but at the moment there is a very good hope at this club.
The squad is good and the boys really enjoy it. It's a good training.
Hopefully now we can develop, put the past behind us and achieve success.”
Woman can't sleep because she's afraid of retirement savings
Although it turned out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only not many people had a discussion with their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
“They wanted family members to provide care, but there was no step to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for care if you don’t tell them what you want first.
Discuss with your counselor and your family, where and how you get treatment, because the one you choose will be very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay for those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your legal documents: Face an incoming legal debate.
Show immediately the power for your health care, i.e. someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your wishes are carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the power of attorney in terms of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, in addition to making sure your bill payment in case you can’t afford it.
Always remember with every little detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer any questions about treatment or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to respond.
“It’s not just finance that plays an important role, it’s who the doctor is dealing with?” Martin asked.
"What are the treatments?
With whom will the dog be taken care of?
Prepare the plan.”
Man shot by air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when multiple gunshots hit his chest, stomach and hands.
The shooting event was described by officers as occurring around 2:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication cut off made it difficult for officials to get information from Donggala County, a region north of the city of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, was estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in the province of South Sulawesi is to find fish and grow crops, especially on the coast of Donggala.
Nevertheless, the existence of nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
In the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, according to data from Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in Donggala collapsed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire and hence earthquakes will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit in recent years are as follows:
In 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, just off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, to the point that it claimed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the deaths were in Aceh.
2005: Late March and early April, a series of also strong earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and leaving nearly 700 people dead.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands in the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya regency, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as panic from people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
Although this time there is no potential for a tsunami, more than 100 people died due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, dubbed the tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which was on the northern side of the island.
The quake devastated thousands of buildings and temporarily toppled thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest attempts, as the Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she snatched the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Pretrial Prisoner Mat-Su, with a <0x24>500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, as sure as he is" when asked about his defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could get him a one-year prison sentence and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
For Palin, the criminal charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently being filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of criminal domestic violence, and possession of a firearm in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin came under fire from a group of veterans for linking her son's violence to PTSD as a result of her stint in Iraq.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds killed
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake, killing at least 384 people.
The 7.5-magnitude quake, which could potentially trigger a tsunami, has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications connections are cut off, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake then struck central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how devastating the moment of the disaster was were circulated widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when a tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for terror attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed -- the punishment is rare and has not been carried out in the state in connection with federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have carried out an attack by crashing a truck he rented from the Home Depot onto pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of will to impose the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, both charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury indicted Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in a racketeering act, which federal prosecutors typically use in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecution, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as the portrayal of Saipov's crimes was carried out with "violence, cruelty, and savagery."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, danger, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York handed down the death penalty for the last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the accused of the murder of two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty last time in New York federal court in 1953, was handed down on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan's origin, showed no remorse as the days and months went by after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack was inspired by a video of ISIS being watched from his phone, as it contained the indictment.
He also asked for the Islamic State flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges laid against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"We think the decision to execute death rather than receive a guilty plea on life imprisonment without bail will only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to sentence him to death.
NIGEL FARGE is in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'moving the people's army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because one of the lawmakers, Theresa May, suggested taking part in negotiations with the EU.
Supporters of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told a street rally in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" at the moment if Farage had served as Brexit Secretary.
Nevertheless, the challenge May faces in reconciling her divided position has been underscored by Remain Tories supporters who joined in separate protests condemning Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a bad backlash – and forced Eurosceptics and Labor to make a choice between his proposed package and “disturbance.”
Bone told the mob Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a colleague to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the responsibility remains with him, we will be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MPs chanted further: "I am ready to stand in support of Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He said, pointing out his opposition to the European Union: “We are not fighting a world war to be submissive.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion had the potential to cause change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants conditions to remain, is completely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: "Simple, I want to say, O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, whereas the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with the party and our activists who are seriously down the street and make us elected in the first place.
Our request, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: “The Prime Minister retains their jobs when their promises are kept.”
Farage said politicians must rally in order to "feel the heat" if they want to renege on the 2016 referendum decision.
“The most valuable thing today is the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They are trying to deny Brexit and this is where we are today, affirming to them that 'we will not allow you to do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to make our political group, which is preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the United Kingdom is self-sufficient, self-governing and proud.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moved through Birmingham before holding an action in the city centre for two hours.
Activists are seen waving Tories Against Brexit banners after sparking a row this weekend.
A colleague in the Labour ranks, Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservatives over their party's application security issues as the conference opened.
“It’s these people who tell us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-friction border, in the framework of unrestricted free trade in Ireland.”
“It’s a funny show.
There is absolutely no good Brexit,’ he added.
Warren plans to 'seriously crash' in presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "crawl the presidential nomination" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's vice-chairman of the 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as Trump's opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, who have held the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked him if there were any plans to run for president.
Warren said it was “the right time for women to enter Washington’s circle to restore our broken government, and that includes the time for women to rise to the top.”
Arrest of Sims shooter, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced the arrest of a suspected shooter that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dython Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified asking for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
While being questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and was sent into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6 foot 6-inch-tall junior, growing up in Baton Rouge, that’s what Sims is, having played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounce balls in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team concedes victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying event that would bring the Mercedes team's order to have a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and drew Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pits and allowed Hamilton to move in in density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after several chases that showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the inside blank at the risk of holding on after a double move to hold on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in most races as he held off a tyre change to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth.
He eventually got into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps as finally Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me down.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her insistence, she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford regarding allegations of sexual violence against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate showing people who were "evil and obscene and dishonest."
“Something can happen and some wonderful thing is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you look at anger, when you look at people who are angry and nasty and obscene and dishonest,” he said.
"When you see an apparition and a leak and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we divulge... No, we didn't divulge it," he added, as the senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the leak did not originate in his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not divulging his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he requested."
But his rejection was apparently disapproved by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you, it's really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the future Supreme Court Justice, who has been accused of sexual abuse against three women, the president was impressed by the Democrats' presumption of using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see evil, vice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk in order to gain power and control," Mediaite reported in the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side in balance before Dwyer restored the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season that Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and eventually outscored to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous game.
The opener from Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a solid opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the feeder for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first half time when shooting his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he ensured victory with his side in the middle of the fifth over the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies To Ensure Hundreds Of Passengers On Plane Safe From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic guide has been hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at a rocking guide tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure Air Batik Flight number 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower begin to collapse.
He died afterwards in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
"We are all saddened to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency delivered access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The number of victims is believed to continue to increase as many bodies are still being overwhelmed by the rubble and many others are not being reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have left Palu devastated which led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarket everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It has been a tragedy, but it may get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was also hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini delivers one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person had disappeared, having previously been delivered to 47 passengers and crew having been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had been working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew, after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and they are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane was overpassing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-high water through the emergency exit on the plane that sank.
He delivered the flight attendants panicking and screaming, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired dock also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal timeline of night women burned alive
The prosecution of the case took place on Saturday in a reexamination of a man accused of arson alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made an outline for the judges on how he used cell phone footage to collect various movements that 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, carried out on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at a location with Chambers on the night of his death, as opposed to a previous defendant's statement, Clarion Ledger said.
When data showed the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency delivered by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers's death, Tellis sometimes deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trios wanted to challenge the negative views of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who hails from Bristol, claims the hip hop movement moved away from the origin of political messages and rammed into social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip hop a popular spirit again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY nanny sues couple for assault after issuing "racialist" message
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and stating that she was "another black person."
The couple refused to consider them racist, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed anxiety at the realization that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is NO BLACK MAN," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
After all, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sends it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they removed the babysitter, who was a mixed African-American, for doing a bad job and that she expected more Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home using Uber.
Currently, Maurice is demanding that the couple be compensated for the dismissal, and asking for about <0x24>350 a day for a period of six months, in compensation for the babysitter job he initially had to work for, despite the absence of a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims that they were racist, saying the fired worker Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, they feared they could not believe him after offending him.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But can you let your children be cared for by someone you’ve been through, even if it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped up in “torture,” Plasco said his wife had just two months to deliver her baby and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“You’re going to go after someone who’s in such a condition?
That’s not a good thing to do,” investment bankers added.
At a time when legal cases were still ongoing, the court of public opinion had made quick denunciations of the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Publisher Paddington worried readers won't be in touch with talking bears, new newspaper revealed
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far away after her book had been received, explained in the letter. "It is very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she is in, reading it first before it is published.
It's funny to know as much as we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a children's book with a bear toy, was very optimistic about his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was felt "bitterly sweet" after his father's death last year.
To Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet person, and he's not a proud person," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though it’s not your whole effort.
I think he sees Paddington's success as such.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time it landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to say it was so bad that she was unlikely to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines that doctors have given to keep his heart beating slowly run out and leave his body system.
He had died some time while the handling process was going on and everything felt deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t groan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure it all."
Finally Madam Ednan-Laperouse, currently mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - unaware of what she had gone through.
"No one knows it," he said.
“My head was lethargic and my tears kept dripping all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women in mourning posted a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile brightens the atmosphere."
But, she stopped working before she died, like she was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that later there will be a sustainable effect."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can go over and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he wasn't looking into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It makes a gap in the family.
That separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in uncertainty when the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think if we really get something like what he's asking for - an investigation that's time-limited, time-limited in scope - we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "broken" amid the board's impasse.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is all due to time.
The legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will become very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim
The number of people who defected from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Ministry of Defence data, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs picked up by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between United States president Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of development since.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, there is no way we would have dropped our weapons unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition Party chief Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not a temperamental fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot avoid the thought that if a woman performs like that, they will say ‘hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and had trouble speaking when discussing about her family and her years during high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve on the Supreme Court because she was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats.”
Pelosi expressed objections if she would try to indict if she was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'd say it like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was seen as a conservative justice understanding adherent.
In a hearing of appointments, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to handle it.
It was an ethical abuse, an anger for months and years, and he couldn’t get it out without crying.
“We cried when we were angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s weird, what do you think?”
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm getting angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were issued as a way out of anger in part because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, one time I cried with an unexpressed rage, was that of an older woman—a cold manager I was always a little afraid of—who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they made it."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
“It’s not a well-thought-out decision,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it the "Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he vowed he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man only gave him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he made the speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overruled by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger towards sexism – made it difficult to speak.
"You'd probably think I was too nervous," recalled Miss Schroeder of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
"Is he crying?"
How U.S.-China trade rivalry may be good for Beijing
The opening shot of the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China is deafening, and while the fight is still far from over, the gap between the two countries may be favorable for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion in goods worth <0x24>150 billion, effectively imposing taxes on half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, recently imposing tariffs to five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of American goods.
China has begged to equal the U.S. one-by-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly yielding to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards appropriately, the pressure of U.S. trade competition could support China positively in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than any observer has ever known before,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offers help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate the areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore them as they were.
All conditions are now present because of the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and the comprehensive economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any conditional help or assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe secure Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee blow into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shines throughout his round, becoming 1 in 4 players ever to get 5-0 since the format adopted in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 over England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with an overall victory with a career point of 25.5 at this tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I can help," said Garcia, who was emotional after the European win.
He gave his responsibilities to compatriot John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
“The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
Odd statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get the fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were making it difficult for Europe.
We're fighting.
Respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to reorganize, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to step forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost top."
