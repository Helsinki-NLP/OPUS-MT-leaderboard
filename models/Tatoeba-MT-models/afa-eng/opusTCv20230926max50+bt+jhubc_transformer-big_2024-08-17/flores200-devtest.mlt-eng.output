USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organization, rather than by removing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists state that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-colored brown at the top and the bottom is pale or carotenoid-colored.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics — "barbs" and "barbules" — the researchers deduced that rachis were likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display.Researchers have suggested that, despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not thin, soft feathers of the young.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the fur of a chick.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Sant'Anna Road.
Just as the moon has a pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Way of St. Anna make a force on Sagittarius's galaxy.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter as does regular matter.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a type of diadema and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
French electoral law codifies the procedures quite strictly.

Candidates can send representatives to testify at any part of the process.In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strong supervision, according to specific procedures.

Apart from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
Her first one was the Slalom, where she achieved "Did Not Finish" (Not Finished) in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, finished in tenth place in the women's seating group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani' arrived in Hungary's Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to finish their laps, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The defendants are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody until she is charged and tried, but any testimony of ocular witnesses can be influenced because a photograph of her has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be in danger if they publish photos etc of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least before the indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants border-based prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered topics reported to include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Tyrants in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the forest rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Shooting Amateurs Association's hunting program for Sports ("Sporting Shooters Association").
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly swore a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Interim Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of damaged iPods have been reported due to overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of the 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company named as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A Filipino former police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed with guns.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating the premature discharge during his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered it will speed up the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two "black boxes" which are the flight recorders.
Her fellow lotteries also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Estrem. My first manager. Luna died in the night of both moons. Indeed unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me...maybe even more than me...I love her and touch her...hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since the year 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believes Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll agree with this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
In voting extremes, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner was expected to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints there were doubts about his state of health.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines for his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number until January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water delivery to the world along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began governing earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalising same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political parols and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to old ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in place and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and "park-and-ride" facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transport have raised the possibility of forcing the game to be played with closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to mating between Darwin's endemic sponge, Geospiza forzatus, and Geospizatus immsun kak
Gold can be made into any kind of shape.It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided.It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal.It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted pictures in books called "manuscripts illuminated".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in unbelievable ways. The biggest thing it has done for us is it has given us easier and faster transportation.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that are free pets) that eat a much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that every cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups which in English are called "prides".
The groups ("prides") are composed of one to three related adult masks, plus a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of brothers and sisters.
Ion groups act like groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A good athlete in all things, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and draw five times more than the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards, and walruses, and these four cats are the only ones that can bark loudly.
A tiger's claw is not like a lion's claw with a loud voice, but more like a sentence of words uttered in a dense manner.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that the ocelots follow and find animals to eat them (princess) with smell, by smelling the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move in hiding, too . The osloths hunt their prey by wandering with their surroundings then jump over their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (as if they move over a range of mountains or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot move back easily) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed anything, still requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look increasingly less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans inhale, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans inflate (i.e., inhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Many of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the predator of the peak of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of years with the roof of her mouth, meaning that anyone who came her way had no chance of escaping.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mossaws, and he may have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not win.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including the wild boar, the pagun, the snail, and a kind of mouse-like rodent that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food sitting on the chairs, the rich men liked to have a dinner together where they would shave on their side while eating their food.
Ancient Rome's meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
The people made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, after it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent in the wilderness.
Women did cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply an open counter opposite the street. Stones were used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
In the sagas of Norway it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the film "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment paper (with a measurement of 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation has been added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south still remained unfree.
These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin words civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which in a certain way also defines the size of society.
A civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a just dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteenth states first formed a weak central government—where Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all of its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
He had no power to override tax and tariff laws between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the samples of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international matches and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical position, as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century where European seamen passing through it registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation into aboriginal wheat production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, a family of APS formats) are equal to this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The highly abused and ridiculed third-party rule is often a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion has united the European states together despite differences in language and customs. I
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to ask whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine war without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the terrible things and atrocities of the war during World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation reoccurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting the different periods of time; each stage of China and each family in power were distinctive dynasties.
Also between each dynasty there was a time of instability with divided provinces.The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these time periods there was a fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient China's history when thousands of people fought to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absoluteism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to just one ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were opened for all male applicants and this allowed those who were the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of not being class-based, the army's rankings were now based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressive working class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find anything even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains in the vicinity. Little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest one), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and families.
The "play up" mark looks like a V and the "play down mark" looks like a staple or square shape without the bottom.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward playing of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the downward playing is louder and more assertive.
You can make the marks you want with a pencil, but remember that the bow marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, usually, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two sons (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, terrified, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and the Queen to keep their car windows wide open.
At one time a member of the crowd shook the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the Queen who was terrified.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine govt through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templar you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time at which events occurred was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning the car.
Car mass ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged trailers.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a luxury epicentre began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusades had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing had a great influence from Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels move slowly, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. one of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses a raised seed that is native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other techniques that are relatively simple to take in maximum yield.
Historically many farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership using a different and symbolic style, which includes ways, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, denigration or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been shackled by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' refusal of the child's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When bred entirely by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that cared for him, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but, rather, an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is kind of a scaffold but even the small man of the paper clip in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons involving neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that still happens.
We consider the Fostering Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caregivers who offer their love, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs that were missing in the home that were previously taken from it.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and satisfactions approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, surface movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, however, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (mits, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way that chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process where you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period and fall asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet velvet that brings you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives on the basis of biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, causing the person to get up to pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated oppositely to the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life present, each person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded by the love trail of mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the energy of Kundalini (enlightened energy) is raised through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, through the visualization of various deities one cleans the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war disagreements in system, process and culture led to the countries fighting.
Only two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It had to last for the next 40 years and it had to be fought for real, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already divided, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became almost obsolete from day to day, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the international regions of eastern Poland in violation of both the Riga Peace Treaty, the Multi-Aggression Pact and the Riga Peace Treaty.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods to cross the oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were domesticated first about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Old cultures and tribes began to retain them to have an easy way of acquiring milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds grazing in the hills or other pasture areas, and often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders.These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England early in the 16th Century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden plans, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the time.
The "crossties" (crossed knots) were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, gradually, the realization was made that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more kerfuffle on cardboard wooden wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels.In 1767, the first fully iron lines were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning man standing) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus would not have stood up habitually.
Bipedal specialties are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs even from seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems, and we should deactivate it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater due to humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten bill and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one value out of two, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the Baqq, which are insects very suitable as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidiculous, suitable for living in a nest or in the location of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the dorsal spine and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However it is not alone, experimentation, and experimentation is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic discharges, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even without external indications.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fagi, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is to visit, take photos, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's small cities by car to go to work and pass by other people whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is linked to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of grumbling about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back in place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are the mozzarella and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, at some points having a width of six miles.
In total, 20 percent of all water that is poured from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were devastated by the monuments of their predecessors who, at that time, were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in an indigenous form and it is relatively simple to dig for them in mines using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: ground, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorized that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. Each matter is made up of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly miniscule that trillions of them sit at the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, pencils were relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to get close to a storm.
You'll know what happens when you create something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to connect a nucleus to many protons and neutrons.
In a similar way as when you push a heavy cart on a hill. The splitting of the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to divide with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the nearest side and 100 km wide on the furthest side.
It is thinner under the "maria" and thicker under the "highlands".
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized when they mature to adult status.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factors Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can result when managers begin to manage their former peers. One end of the spectrum is to try to keep feeling like one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary action, perform evaluations, assign responsibilities, and make people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he should change everything the team has done and mark it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team as their teams may meet according to varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each of the members reports to him. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process that takes so much time setting up an organization to learn? One of the goals for putting into practice the concepts of an organization to learn is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data give physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus making the field of research less vast and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumours affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customers' diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of calligraphy, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been built into various home computer software applications and videogames.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often, teachers like to take their students to places where there is no possibility to go by bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips . Students can look at museum artefacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip with others virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is changed again, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing . Although students often start their blogging experience with bad grammar and spelling, having an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer starts working to improve writing so that it is not criticized.
Also blogging "makes students know more about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more reachable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's incandescent and bilingual capital and contains an array of art galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
Further to the south is the Niagara Falls and to the north is the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas to the north have fairly sparse population and some are areas in an almost uninhabited natural state.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent for it when we talk about wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and this spread greatly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is traveling say that she is married, regardless of her current state regarding marriage.
It is useful to wear a ring as well (just not one that seems to cost a lot of money.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may regard as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, abducted by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether or not there are cultural differences, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese broke it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as his House the Badya and was given the name "Casablanca" by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tags, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of gigawatts, but all of them are touristic.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched to know the state of the fighting that still persists in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base to nest with the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (taxi motor) to turn into Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for a short turn.
Along with its relative unavailability, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities of the country, because it has elements more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River ("Crocodile River").
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks ("South African National Parks" - SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily conservation and entry fees are applied to the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which provides income either for park selections in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island ("Hong Kong Island") gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The deployment of the building that forms the Hong Kong skyscraper has been likened to a brightly lit chart bar due to its appearance with the presence of the waters of the Port of Victoria.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the North shore.
This is the place that British colonists took as theirs and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest littoral mangrove forest, 80 km (50 miles) long from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in wetlands — they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about one third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 dotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (along the river) during the day, though most of them, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended that you buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Several districts contain small Japanese Coaster Buses services, which are comfortable and sound.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two 3.50 m wide carriageways.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who survived hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo camps in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley adjacent to FIC West store.
The British pound will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley the credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the external islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although English and US currency may be accepted; talk to owners in advance to see what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the Equator, there is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is found in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above <0x2B>30<0xC2><0xB0>C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to feel colder than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose (large North American deer), bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance, these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they give them their space.
However, you should be aware that the odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keeping the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa.This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-nineteenth century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland is located between two ports. The best known ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have the shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the Auckland Centre.
These are sandy beaches for the family which are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer called "Manta".
There are many French wines you can find, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia probably travel better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but you'll easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee called "flat white" is unfamiliar. "Black short" is "espresso", capuccino is filled with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards.Fruit juice is expensive but it is excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to security messages.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Sometimes they can also be seen outside of these times.
Although sharks exist, they rarely attack people.Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If you book in advance, the traveler will have a restful mind that he will have somewhere to sleep upon arrival at his destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping places, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include a breakout, transportation arrangements to/from the airport and even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to get other documents to your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests shall be forwarded to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who go to music festivals decide to camp on the spot, and many consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action closely you must arrive early to have a camping site close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be gone, there may be sections of the festival that keep playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the North Baltic in winter, carefully check the location of the cabin, because when you pass through the ice it emits a horrible sound for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city time.Cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.There are usually no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find exit locations.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them on site.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, however, drunkenness disrupts judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining a sobrium.
Anyone who will drive in high latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, there is not much friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, in a short period of time, you can get enough snow to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling snow or flying or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travelling on land for the observation of African wild and fantastic animals, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, citadels and leopards are sometimes spotted and seen better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "walking in the "bush" ("bush walk")", "safari on a hike ("hiking safari")", or "going "footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the matches in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, and typical tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Many hotels have a ironing board and a pass board available for you to use, even if you don't have one in the room.
If a ironing board is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks passed, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which may cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in bottles sealed by a company that has a good name.
Travellers may encounter skewed animals that they are unfamiliar with in their regions of residence.
Plagues can ruin food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duty in certain places.
Travellers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often runs through isolated backwoods stretches.
If you're not used to driving on the countryside roads, be careful: there is a predominance of steep hills, narrow lanes and steep turns.
Maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and their strict obedience is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, however, the mobile service is much more powerful here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastes are common, and cooked apples are used in pastes all year round, and cherries and plums begin in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Known cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the ones that by region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish based on spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "juicy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the large variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main Java island.
Javanese cooking, which is now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant favorite flavourings of Javanese are peanuts, cilices, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and walnuts.
Stables are support for the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues because of the potential for the rider's legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot caught in the stall, he may be dragged if the horse escapes. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions may be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow heel and pett.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stagnant leather strip to be detached from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley (Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley) - The main destination for climbing Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with several large walls of granite and rock.
The highest points include spectacular views from the peaks . Xabbatars from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amid the endless potential of its walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on ice-covered terrain on skis or an ice board attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan whole holidays around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club by Norwegians in Australia was opened.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called "backcountry ski", "ski touring" or "ski hiking".
It is related to, but generally does not involve, touring an alpine-style ski or mountaineering, where the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than you would otherwise walk – but it is only very rare that you will have "cross-country" skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.Usually, to travel from many countries you will have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you will generally be able to cross borders without re-passing through the checkpoints for passport verification.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar goods produced in mass.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and the culture across the trade is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, despite this, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mostly as animals to draw heavy weights.
Today many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "Gypsies" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Roman people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel notice, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments and not your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, ice, excessive rain, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, airbursts, seabursts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include strong ice storms, ice rinks, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who organises a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone must carry out professional training.
An Internet search for a "hostile environment course" will probably upload a local company's address.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually from 2-5 days and involves role play, a lot of training in first aid and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are not too many publications about war zones.
Travellers planning a surgical operation for sexual reassignment abroad must ensure that they are carrying the valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Split currents ("rip currents") are the flow that returns from waves that are cut off from the beach, often in a reef or similar.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and may form a fast current to the deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to fatigue after trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it will not be more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to target somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock comes before the culture shock (there is a shorter phase of the honey moon), lasts longer, and may be more intense.
Travellers who have found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after having lived abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your customs of your country's culture.
When I first arrived, people were probably patient and understanding at first, knowing that travelers in a new country would need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things on the children's side.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors.The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula.The largest is King George Island with the colonization of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here merge into the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinella Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as it must be outside with a clear satellite view to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as dispatches needing to communicate remotely with voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming more popular among those planning a year of study break is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interval year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing towards higher education back in your country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for shipping. The "Land of a thousandand lakes" (land with a thousand lakes) also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the lakes and lakes you don't need to go out.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in every forty).
Many of the distinguished Cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days while returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using on-board excursions you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never seen or experienced a traumatic event before.
It's not something you want to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people have to other things.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear that is based on what they don't know or things they can't control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have dispatched cargo by air, in some routes it may have taken days for them to pass through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where it comes in.
The obvious way of flying in the first class or business class is to get out a thick bunch of money for the privilege (or, so much better, hire your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as approximate rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business (business class), and eleven times more for first class (first class)!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts for seats in the business class and those in the first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the unsuccessful political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation center.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern business centre, developed and full of activity, built around a huge beach and surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean-style atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of pigeons on certain tombs.
You won't regret spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
To the north and easily reached is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra and which became known to foreigners after the description filled with praise for its great beauty expressed by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the north you will visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Cappella), the place of the Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that, in essence, you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who have managed to survive the long time they have been here, and many more who had their loved ones killed or worked to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not make field vandalism by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the majority of the people understand it, and almost everyone can practically speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan because it is established by law as an official first language.
But, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, cold and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is still to behave well, and act like someone who is "enoughly raised" (well-bred). This helps considerably to cope more easily.
The unfriendly attitudes of Parisians quickly fade away when shown by basic theories.
Plitvice's Ghadjar natural park is covered with many trees, mainly beech trees, spruce and fir, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and wild boar can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting the monasteries, women have to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Many of the monasteries provide a veil for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with shouting colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or sister at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after every person who wears them so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men there is a unique size for everyone!
Majorca cooking, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in each dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is the Oli Pam amb: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and the conditions that are available such as cheese, oil tuna, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between verbs and objects.
Certainly, this facilitates reading, although writing is a little complicated due to the need to find out whether a verb or an adjective are used in a substantiveized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters you must look out for are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation varies depending on which vowels come after them.
Also, be sure to pronounce different r and rr: caro means expensive, while carro means trailer.
The Persian language has relatively easy grammar and, for the most part, regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar introductory book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish can hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational venues.
As light pollution at its peak has not been the kind of problem we currently have, they are generally found in cities or campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom display, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor for him and for other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants appear at their best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, resist the temptation to remove even a "only one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, the collection of "samples" will also lead to you being evicted, without discussions.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be in and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator you will need to face both heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rare).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to catch goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or cruises to interesting towns on the Danube or boat tours along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular trails for long walks and bicycle driving.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition that passes on Easter eve awakened in an exposed place to see the rising of the sun.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring ritual and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by blinding, sighting or floating here.
Because of the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey so the giant tortoise became the main animal of grazing inside the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are standard workwear, and colleagues call each other by surname or work titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis placed on the effort of the group and not on the encouragement of individual achievements.
Workers often need to get their superiors' approval for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without reservations.
