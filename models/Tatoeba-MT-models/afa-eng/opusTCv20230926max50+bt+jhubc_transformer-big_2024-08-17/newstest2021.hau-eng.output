Why did I leave the PDP?
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has explained some reasons why he left the PDP and moved to the APC.
If the former Speaker of the National Assembly is not forgotten, Yakubu Dogara has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and returned to the APC this week.
Dogara said that he stood up against Governor Bala of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bauchi State who helped him to win the 2019 general elections, mobilized and left the party to return to the APC.
One of the main reasons I'm here is because of the way the PDP is governed in Bauchi State.
Everyone knows the role I played in the governorship election in the state which was defeated by the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar, former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed.
I am now a member of the government
Instead of staying in the PDP, I was given the opportunity to stay away from them and go back to where I came from.
Dougara wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which he sent to the party chairman of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
In the end, he said that as he pointed out to other governors where they had failed and where they would fix it later, he was not anointed with oil.
I'm going to let them go
A fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire broke out at about 10pm, which lasted for about two hours, despite calls from Kano State Fire Service, security officials and the local community.
During Freedom Radio's visit to the place, she found a crowd of mourners and various security officials at the scene wherever she went, being the location connected to the main bus station known as the Kuka station, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and even neighboring countries of the country.
In addition to the Kofar Water market which has excelled in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio has spoken with other eyewitnesses, who say the fire's eruption has caused a life-saving public outcry.
A police officer at the Kofar Ruwa station said they had collaborated with security officials to rescue the passengers who had entered in fear of the fire.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, saying that as of the time of compiling this report it was still gathering information to determine the cause and the loss caused by the fire, according to the spokesman of Sa'idu Ibrahim.
On the other hand, there were reports that there were some bandits who tried to break into the market through the Water Gate to steal, but police and security officers tried to free them and keep the community property.
In this regard, we contacted the spokesperson of the Kano State Police Command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
KORONA: We have not yet finished testing the quality of the drug included in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to test the quality of their coronavirus medicines, Nigeria has not been left behind in its drug testing efforts.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is conducting a COVID-19 drug test for up to 40 traditional drug users.
The head of the Mojisola Adeyeye Commission announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that the quality of the drugs is being tested so as not to seek obesity compensation.
Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicine manufacturers have been conducting research to see that they have not been left behind to see that the drug has been included.
Many of them have submitted their drug samples to the authorities for testing and evaluation of its efficacy.
The NAFDAC has also set out some rules and regulations that will apply to the treatment.
The quality of the drug will be tested in animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned the drug users not to rush to try another drug without the agency's permission.
In May, the NAFDAC said that only social media and news outlets were reporting that the plaintiffs had found a traditional remedy that would cure the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said only one person had approached the NAFDAC to check the quality of the drug, which he claimed was a traditional combination, which he said could cure the coronavirus.
But it's not the same thing as being a drug addict.
He said that he had found a cure for the symptoms of the disease that were seen as symptoms of infection.
Since then, however, a number of companies have come to grips with the
Ramaphosa faced questions in court.
It was the first time in a series of interviews with lawmakers that Ramaphosa had since the corruption scandal broke out between his top government officials and some members of his party.
Ramaphosa has committed to in-depth research and even reform in the area responsible for overseeing the procurement of anti-COVID-19 products.
South Africa is the fifth country in the world to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president has said corruption plays a key role in the fight against the pandemic.
Nigeria's National Airports will be opened on Saturday.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open the airports for outbound and outbound flights from Saturday, for the first time in five months.
Since March 23, the country's government has suspended flights, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The government has said that the first four international flights will begin landing in Abuja.
The city of Lagos, but it is not yet clear where these ships will come from.
According to Transport Minister Hadi Sirika, the opening step is to see that there has been no problem since the opening of domestic flights on July 8.
Sirika added that it would be ensured that all necessary procedures were followed in order to ensure the successful return of the aircraft.
There have been 591 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

France's Marseille national football team says three more players have been infected with the coronavirus, after five deaths last week.
The statement was made in a statement to the media today.
In addition, the club said that the French League 1 tournament, which was scheduled to start on Friday, had been postponed as a result of the five players infected with COVID-19.
Marseille also said it had already informed stakeholders in the preparation of the League 1, following an increase of three cases after the first five cases, in order to find a solution.
The APC has accused the governor of Niger and attempts to disrupt the party's leadership. - Hausa Newspapers
In a statement released this week, the All Progressives Congress (APC) accused the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of trying to destabilize the party.
The document, which was signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam, and the Secretary of the Bari Party, Muhammed Liman, said that in the six years the party had been in power in the state, only N512 million had been received.
The document went on to say that the governor's call for stakeholders, which he led on Sunday night over the weekend, would help to further destabilize the party, saying they had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the party's heads by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, for any complaint against the leaders of the party, to be written to the regional party secretariat, for investigation."
He added that in the six years since the establishment of the party, 512 million naira have been in the party's accounts.
He said that he understood as the governor to be part of the National Steering Committee set up on July 25, 2020, which was led by the President to lead the preparation of the problems between the members of the party and the withdrawal of the complaints in court among the members of the party.
We pay the salaries of the party's secretarial staff, as well as other activities related to the party, the priority elections and the adjustment of some of the party's problems such as health support due to the lack of access to government funding, not any of the party's funds that we have illegally spent, we challenge any party's spending.
As I have stated, the last local government primaries were the most important local government primaries in the country that we have had with the former commissioners and commissioners who are now in power in all 25 local government areas of the state, whose funds have been disbursed in the elections.
It is therefore a mistake for any person to say which party funds are being illegally spent, this is almost an injustice and attempts to protect the innocent are trying to hang him, which is to say that no committee has been set up to investigate how the party funds are spent and who set it up.
Of the funds that the complainant has raised, the funds are provided by the National Secretariat of the party, not by any other party, so I challenge anyone on this issue to prove this allegation in any way.
"We stand firm on defending the APC from any attempt to corrupt the party or any group, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the committee in charge of the zone according to the party's constitution as set out in section 21 (B) (ii) (d) of the constitution.
Therefore the party's stakeholders have no role to play especially if they attempt to seize the power of the committee and so their sentence has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party recognized in the state, at the 21st Amendment and the sixth paragraph on page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this will not be used.
It's a mistake to judge leaders.
He said those who came forward with confidence at yesterday's unscheduled meeting, which Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party's stakeholders is led only by the party's leader, Eng. Mohammed Imam, and not by the governor.
The document added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the election, and travelling with the parents of the party in the government so that everyone in the state and all areas can benefit by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document commended the members of the Federal House of Assembly who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to the settlement of all disputes between the members of the party, this is not surprising to the members of the House who are familiar with the illness, who have refused to accept false arrest as a law of the party.
Therefore, there is a need for the Chairman of the National Transitional Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate position not to attempt to disrupt the political structure of the state.
Nigeria is ready for the next phase of the Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Internet Economic Development, Dr Isa Ali, Pantami, said the country is ready for a revolution in the Internet economy.
He also said that the government is ready to work hand in hand with university experts and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is engaged in any technological developments.
Dr. Isa Ali Fantami made this known during an international conference on the development of telecommunications technology conducted via the Internet.
The minister also added that one of the first steps taken by the government to ensure the country's long-term commitment to telecommunications technology was to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Telecommunications to the Ministry of Telecommunications and Internet Economic Development.
How food insecurity affects people's health in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that are used as food preservatives and that eating such foods is harmful to human health.
The study was carried out after a review of the quality of food in the country.
The results of the study showed that there are certain foods that are chemically soluble in order to prevent them from evaporating.
The study also showed that this chemical was most commonly used in beans, salads and dried fish that are popularly served.
The product is used because it is intended to be used by a buyer.
Eating foods that contain this nutrient can cause cancer, kidney disease, heart attack, and so on.
The people of the country are urged to pay attention to the prevention of the use of these types of foods for their health.
Not to be forgotten, Food Quality expert Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid consuming the ingredients of the milled trees with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Calcium Carbide Syringe is the most widely used ingredient by traders in the grinding of vegetable oils, that is, the raw material of desire.
Research has shown that the abundance of patience and redness are among the factors that make traders use this chemical because in a single day it shows the presence of tree products.
Olasumbo explained that one thing that marketers failed to recognize was the use of this chemical to demonstrate a desire to harm people's health.
For this reason, it is recommended to treat diseases including mummy, eye pain, abdominal pain, sore throat, mouth, liver and others.
The head of the African Development Bank has been cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
A panel of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared the head of AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of corruption charges.
The AFP news agency reported that earlier this year, it was a 15-page report that accused 60-year-old Mr Adesina of "priority, lack of leadership and self-sufficiency."
However, Robinson's panel of experts, together with Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and Vice-President of the World Bank, Leonard McCarthy, have cleared the former Minister of Agriculture of Nigeria of all allegations against him.
In the past, the United States insisted that Mr. Adesina should be investigated over the allegations, following a clean-up by the AfDB board of directors, which led to the establishment of a panel of experts to investigate the incident.
COVID-19 has prevented Trump's election campaign from taking place in Florida.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he had cancelled a Republican convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of a surge in coronavirus cases.
The meeting will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it was not appropriate to hold a convention at this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP meeting to Florida last month after they clashed with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the meeting in a closed conference room with his supporters without wearing face masks.
A few Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to formally elect Trump on August 24.
Trump has said he will take a different approach.
Trump, who for months has been showing a lack of awareness about the impact of the pandemic, said recently that 99 percent of the cases seen in the United States have increased.
Buhari will not accept the blessings of the Salalah.
This was revealed by the Chief Media Adviser, Garba Shehu, in a statement released by the Palace on Wednesday.
He also said that the President would not accept those who used to come to him to give him the blessings of prayer.
Shehu said the action was taken as a result of recommendations made by the Islamic Supreme Council to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
President Muhammadu Buhari also stressed the steps recommended by the House of Representatives to avoid multi-stakeholder meetings being held in the same place.
At the small festival of prayer held that year, the president celebrated his feast at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he usually does every year.

China has achieved its people's prosperity and food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the soul of all living beings, it cannot live without food.
This is why the Chinese authorities are making it more important to ensure the welfare of the nation and food.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great achievements in the area of food security which has surprised the world to see the country's population, which according to an estimate of the number of Chinese has exceeded 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped China to make the biggest contribution to ending hunger in the world, as the head of China's cereals and agricultural products storage agency, Zhang Wufeng, once stated that, since 1949 until now, China has always placed the issue of addressing hunger in front of all the country's foreign affairs.
But in recent days, some people and other Western media have once again "reflected concern" over whether China will be able to raise its own nation in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide?
We are so grateful to them for the new and ever-present Chinese presence in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has managed to produce enough food based on the man's efforts.
The issue of providing enough food for the Chinese is one of the main agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last weekend, the Secretary-General of the JKS Supreme Committee, you are the President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important directive on the cessation of food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that all food waste and labor costs are caused.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy is also having a negative impact on China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimates on the number of agricultural products, especially rice, that will be available in the country in 2020, show that the total number of rice obtained in the country in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, up 1.08 million tons, an increase of 3.9 percent compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, a former head of China's Agricultural University, said China has achieved great achievements in terms of both food and the country's wealth compared to the early period of implementation of the policy of domestic and open-door conversions.
Huang Jikun, director of Peking University's China Agricultural Policy Analysis Center, said during a meeting with a representative of the China Science Daily, that the most serious challenge facing China is whether it can reduce wheat and rice production in the next two to three years.
Now the average annual harvest of wheat is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should earn each year.
China is now importing millions of tonnes of agricultural products for domestic animal husbandry alone.
In addition, those who are concerned about the issue should calm down, take a bath, go to sleep, or focus on the affairs of their home country.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves with the food they produce.
The reason why I took Ganduje to court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano governorship candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf has explained his reasons for arraigning Kano governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other businessmen before the state high court.
Abba Kabir said this through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wazirci, who said he filed the lawsuit, alleging the ownership of some government buildings by the people of Kano State.
In addition to the Kano governorship and the businessmen, Abba Kabir Yusuf also sued the state Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport and the Attorney General and the Kano Commissioner of Justice and the state land administration agency.
Father Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government of owning a number of individuals from the former Daula Hotel, which is now under the supervision of the Wudil University of Science and Technology and the Shahuci Station, for violating the country's laws.
It will only be available for purchase in 2023.
The son of Mother and great friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has revealed that the current style of governance in Nigeria is outdated.
Maman Daura said Nigeria had already made the point that it is now abandoning the admissions system to focus on the most qualified candidate in 2023.
The BBC has published an interview with Maman Daura in which he explained this.
This process of acceptance into the presidential election in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-opening son beginning in 1999.
Instead, he said, the focus should be on identifying the right candidate until the process is completed.
However, the Igbo people, the Inyamirs, have responded to Daura's comments.
They said that he and his brother, President Buhari, had seized control of the country through a coup d'etat and that he would now come out and recommend that this should not be done in 2023.
Buhari himself is not the most elected of all Nigerians.
The same is true of the country's top security officers, who have been sitting in positions of power for many years and have not been able to function as well.
Martini Inyamirai.
A political storm of Nigeria's presidency died on Wednesday, as the Igbo People's Union, Ndigbo, crushed Mamman Daura, over his statement to the Igbo people.
In an interview with Daura, who is the brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that the presidential election in 2023 will be zonal.
As a result of his not being able to complete his social studies, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement to Mother Daura, calling him a controversial figure.
In a statement released by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo People's Union for the South and South-East will be allowed to elect the president in the 2023 general elections.
Spokesman of the Igbo Zalla ethnic group, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's words as vice president of Nigeria in 2023 were directed at the Igbo people.
Why didn't you tell your mom that you've been a victim of bullying since the beginning of the year?
They personally sacked Jonathan, and now Daura is running for president of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.
He's just finished collecting what he's got from his brother-in-law now, and he's going to come up with something we don't know about in 2023.
As an elder, he must embrace the truth and hold it firmly.
He did not come out as the leader of the country's presidential campaign in 2023, but as a leader he was self-serving and self-serving.
VOA Discussion Sessions on Rape.
Rape of women and children is a common issue in northern Nigeria where there have been reports of violations of children's rights.
People from all walks of life gathered in the hall on July 23 to discuss how the situation is worsening in the country and how to overcome it.
The participants of the session attributed the problem to factors such as the advertising of child brides and the neglect of other parents.
One of the mothers who attended the Hajiya meeting Fathi'a Shaibu, the former first lady of Plateau State and Niger State during the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that make dora's parents advertise to their children.
The Holy Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) said: “We have been sent to Maryam (Mary) and she has been sent to us and we have been sent to her by the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) and we have been sent to her by the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam).
We also call on teachers to give a strong witness to the parents and siblings who are raping their children and young people.
He, a member of the National Assembly representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse Constituency of Kebbi State Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed regret and support for the introduction of a strict law that would punish anyone found guilty of rape in the country.
At the end of the meeting, Hajiya Medina Davida and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who led the conference hall, thanked the attendees on behalf of the VOA who accepted their invitation.
The "New Media Writers" campaign for the North Pole
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long played a role in creating forums for dialogue, collaboration and communication between different world communities, with the delivery of messages, stories, and the dissemination of political, educational and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have taken part in this new technology using social media platforms, to navigate the modern world, and to contribute or spit their mouths out on social media related to their lives.
We can say that these rings have brought us a lot of progress that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the area of business, economy, education and politics.
Many eat through writing and delivering messages on the web, finding jobs or developing the services they run.
However, it is disappointing to see how some young people, instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to benefit from the progress achieved, have found others following in the footsteps of the children of the south of the country who have become the most prominent in the world in the manipulation of the public, in and outside the country, or in the writing of libels and abuse of judges and predecessors.
This is a sign of the lack of progress in the lives of young people.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers Group in the country is a great thing, in order to provide young people of the North with a sense of direction, good direction and clean up of the things that young people are doing in Soshiyal Midaya, so that they will be able to write meaningful and spread the policies of the Northern community.
We need to give this organization the cooperation it needs to achieve its charitable goals, which will bring benefits not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially the users of social networks, to come together to protect the dignity and freedom of the North, and to create a system that will be transformative for all.
As our North African leaders who have spent so much time as Sardauna Sokoto, the First Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close associates have aspired to provide for the people of the North.
It was reported that the late anti-poverty and anti-poverty activist Malam Aminu Kano once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
We therefore say that, certainly as we call for the creation of national development and the improvement of governance, at every level, we further call for the unity of Northerners, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring development to our region.
We're looking at how the North is doing.
So we should use God's wisdom and counsel to provide the North with a satisfactory path for its economic recovery.
The North should provide revenue streams for the implementation of its budget without waiting for the federal government to save money.
In addition, as long as we want the development of the North, we attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
It's not just about making money, there are different ways to do it.
That's what we hope to see in the North!
We are proud of the North.
The government has allocated N126 billion for the rehabilitation of the country's hospitals.
The Federal Government has allocated N126 billion from the country's economic recovery plans for the rehabilitation of hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be rehabilitated include FMC Hospitals, Places for Disease Testing, Department of Emergency Care, Department of Infectious Diseases and Prevention, and Teaching Hospitals in the 36 states of the country.
Last year, some health care providers called on government departments to join forces to allocate sufficient funds to improve the country's health sector.
The experts made the call at the meeting to find a platform on providing good health care for people in a simple and sustainable way in Abuja.
In his speech, the candidate for the Kwara North Senatorial District on the platform of APC Sadiq Umar said that the Nigerian government should take the matter of improving the health of the country more seriously.
This has led to a lack of financial resources, which has led to a high level of dependence on foreign aid.
Umar said that despite the support, there was no role for the government in the health sector, so they started withdrawing their support.

The number of people starving to death in Africa will rise as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
The International Centre for Agricultural Development (IFAD), has said that there will be at least 23 million more people starving in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made the announcement at the World Economic Forum's Economic Forum.
The theme of this year's conference was on the theme of food security in Africa during the coronavirus pandemic.
Houngbo said studies, forecasts and figures on the scale of the food crisis showed that by 2020 famine victims in sub-Saharan Africa will outnumber those killed by the coronavirus pandemic, not too far away.
IFAD is a centre that is renowned for supporting people living in rural areas in developing agriculture, increasing the provision of nutritious food for their children and providing them with income through agriculture.
Houngbo said the coronavirus showed that there was a serious problem with the food supply, distribution and rehabilitation system.
Many farmers struggle with the fact that they are unable to access modern fertilizer due to the traffic ban law.
They couldn't get to the farm and those who were selling the crops were shut down and the markets were forced to sell their crops.
According to the report, in 2019, 135 million people died from hunger worldwide, 73 million of them from Africa in 36 countries.
In Northern Nigeria, hunger killed 5 million people in 2019.

The EU will enter between Turkey and Greece on the Mediterranean Sea.
EU ministers have vowed to intervene after a spate of clashes between Turkey and Greece over the Mediterranean Sea.
The meeting was scheduled for Thursday to discuss how to resolve the issue.

The Minister of Agriculture of Nigeria, Alhaji Sabo Muhammad Nanono, has challenged state and local governments on the issue of security in Nigeria.

The minister said: "The truth is not only that the federal government has the right to protect this thing, state governments and local governments, if you go to the country as far as Dagatai and the locals, they have done it again and let this security situation become what it has become, but everyone stands up and says the federal government."
The federal government has the right to protect public life, but those who are close to these people should first of all start saying that we think we have a problem with these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its utmost to develop agriculture and food production in the country.

The people of Kano State have taken to the streets of Ganduje in front of Buhari - Hausa Newspapers
Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow money from a Chinese bank to build a railway line.
A coalition of more than 15 groups under the shadow of Kano Forum has described what it called the huge debt that the Ganduje government wants to pay for the construction of the first phase of the railway line in the city of Kano as useless in view of the major challenges ahead of the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje would pay a debt of 684 million euros, or N3 billion, which they said had not been paid in 50 years.
The Chairman of Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa said it was almost impossible for Kano State to take on any more debt than it had already been borrowed in the past.
In Nigeria, rape is not the worst crime in the world.
A class leader in the community in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, has pointed out that the death penalty for a person arrested for rape in the country, especially in northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maidaije made the announcement in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that the authorities have confirmed this after investigation, the verdict of murder is the only solution.
He added that the decision will reduce the number of rape cases that can be found easily, but the main thing is to fix our hearts.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "We have no knowledge of the unseen, but we have no knowledge of the unseen."
It would be a shame if an adult male were raped by a young girl, a three-year-old girl, or a five-year-old girl.
He went on to say that between God and us, we will not criticize the leaders or the rulers of the country, pointing out that there is no way to fail to make progress if there is such an injustice.
He added that because of this, we are in pain and suffering in the country, because the country has not progressed, they themselves are Kings and Governors and the President, they have not been able to deal with the matter.
He added that once the blessings were lifted up and another one was lifted up, it became necessary to fix our hearts so that God could bring us a solution to the issue of rape.
He said that even if they were doing it for the sake of chastity, they should do everything to glorify God because it is the root of all misery and poverty for the nation.
God knows what you are going through, and He knows what you are going through, and He knows what you are going through, and He knows what you are going through, and He knows what you are going through.
He pointed out that the police are also doing their best to send the alleged rapists to the Magistrates' Courts to do their best in what has become a tragedy, in our region of Northern Nigeria as well as in the country.
He called on parents to keep a close eye on their siblings, setting an example of how the advertisements of their mothers' doras are adding to the problem.
He said that some parents do not follow the life of their children whether they go to school or not, whether they return home on time or not, adding that the fault is partly the negligence of some parents because they should know that it is God who has given them the children and tomorrow he will ask them what kind of upbringing they have had for their children.

Farmers in Beniwe expect to grow and grow locally in the children's sector - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
Rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to harvest as much as two months after planting.
Some of them raised in Makurdi expressed hopes that the harvest would be at any point between October and November.
A smallholder farmer in the state's Mbatiab-Gboko town, Titus Atondo, said he planted his rice in a two-hectare area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from the market in his area and were in two groups of CP and OC rice while using Dazzle to clear land for planting plants and fertilizers.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenge of growing rice in rural areas such as Maina is high because we rely so heavily on labor as customers are unable to access the farm's facilities.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people who will work from the ground up to the harvest, adding that this is tired and has a lot.
Atondo said all of the money spent on his farm that is now in place includes planting, clearing, fertilizer applications and the expected harvest is N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags of corn as a harvest from two hectares and possibly to be sold at a price of 29,000 naira per 100k bag.
He also planted a large rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, from June to July on 274 acres of farmland at a price of N14,500 per hectare while the land was paying N25,000 in hectare.
He planted 44 seeds (Supi) and 61 seeds (OC) obtained from the National Agricultural Development Council (OAG) and others originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that the levels of growth at this time are in different fields while others are in the process of herding, and others are the first stage of killing animals as is the cultivation of crops in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include the financial ones since the price of production of the selected animals is expensive and the price of labor has increased.
He said the harvest is expected to start in October to November.
He added that the total price of groceries at the end of the day would be a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while the production is expected to be three tons of honey which could translate into N360,000 at a rate of N120 per kilogram.
Tarnongu does not use pesticides on his rice paddies, instead, he advocates the implementation of traditional agriculture, adding that, therefore, we use highly insect-killing plants, pesticides and fertilizers.
The Chairman of the Benue State Chapter of the National Association of Farmers (AFAN), Comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed hope that the rainy season this year will be suitable for high-quality rice cultivation.
According to the Chairman of the Benue State Farmers Association (AFAN), Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers entered rice farming at the end of this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has prevented many people from leaving offices and remaining on their farms.
He said, "Children will harvest 20 percent of what is produced in 2019, which is estimated to be more than one million tons."
According to him, the data collectors are currently taking statistics of different types of farmers and once the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The Chairman of the Benue State chapter of the Farmers' National Association (AFAN), Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said he cultivated three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers planted rice in June while those on short-term farming do so in the same harvest period expected in late November or early December.
The AFAN Chairman added that rice farmers are using raw materials to kill old grasses, chemical residues, and pesticides.
He expressed concern about the challenges of livestock threatening rice farming, adding that farmers were doing fences, putting ropes together and clearing the edges of the fields to solve the problem.
COVID-19: Two-and-a-half million face masks have been distributed in Kano.
The Kano State government in the north-western part of Nigeria has imposed a two-and-a-half-million-barrel face-and-nose ban.
The distribution of the goods was led by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje at a meeting held at the State Government House.
Governor Ganduje said the use of sanctions across the state was necessary, following the state's success in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic known as the Coronavirus.
According to him, they have already placed the traditional kingdoms of the state in this state, where the chiefs, wards and wards are working hard to ensure the containment of the outbreak.
In addition, the governor made it possible for them to distribute restrictions to workers' organizations in the state.
On his part, the Emir of Kano, Alh Aminu Ado Bayero, thanked God for the ease with which the COVID-19 outbreak has spread in Kano State.
He also urged Ummah to continue to support the government in ending the epidemic and to pray for those who lost their lives.
He advised the public to hold public prayers in the care of self-protection against COVID-19.
It is important to follow the guidelines set by the health authorities, especially in places of worship.
"Any party where I don't necessarily have to be boycotted is a matter of time," the Emir of Kano said.
Speaking from the outset, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyaya, commended the state government for the precautionary measures it continues to take to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
In addition, he said, there is a reduction in cases of the virus, and various parts of government and non-governmental organizations applaud the government's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commenting during the meeting, the State Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, said that in addition to the sprays they conducted in public and private ministries and businesses, they have now distributed more than the nose-and-mouth-protection package that has amounted to about 7,000.
Some of the organizations that benefited from this system of face-and-nose-protection ratios reaching 2.5 million include the three founding motorcycle organizations TOAKAN, the NURTW, NARTO, RTEAN, car dealership groups, the council group and other local government workers.
The meeting, which was held at the opening of the Kano State Government House of Assembly, was attended by key health stakeholders, traditional monarchies, and thousands of workers' organizations.
A two-day meeting was held for the election of the Republic of Niger.
The issue of respect for the rights of women by the national laws aimed at ensuring that they do not have full access to the electoral laws that are being administered in order to play a significant role in the administrative laws is one of the key issues discussed by the CNDP meeting, according to Dr. Dita Idrissa, spokesperson for the MRN coalition of governing parties.
The so-called "Left" parties have also agreed to this process of bringing women into politics, starting with the issue of giving them a ticket to vote in political parties, as the leader of the coalition of these parties, Malam Hambali Dodo, has stated.
Revisiting the electoral process under which elections are held in Niger is one of the demands brought by the participants of this meeting because they say it is a way to prevent fraud.
However, this requirement has not been met, as the Commission has said that it is against the law to vote on any draft legislation at the time of the commencement of the competition.
The opposition, which continues to boycott all other security measures, did not attend this meeting, a move that is linked to the illegality they said surrounded the CENI electoral commission.
Local government elections are expected to be held on December 13, 2020, while the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections will be held just two weeks after the 27th.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have denied Abike Dabire's claim that the students are being murdered in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, the TRCN, have denied the head of the Nigerian Overseas Residents Commission (NiDCOM), warning parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, saying the children were being raped.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa warned that hundreds of Nigerians were being killed in Northern Cyprus, without the country's government conducting a full investigation.
Dabiri made this confession after the news of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel.
A Nigerian man was killed and no further explanation has been heard.
The murder of Ibrahim Khaleel would serve as a lesson for parents to stop sending their children around the world, being killed in vain, especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that people don't know that the whole world is not allowed to have Northern Cyprus.
The United Nations does not recognize the
Thousands of Nigerians are studying in Nigeria, but hundreds of Nigerians are being killed in the country.
He said that Nigeria would reveal the names of hundreds of Nigerians murdered in the country.
However, while responding, Nigerian students studying in the country said that peace in Northern Cyprus, far above that of Nigeria, is not too far away.
The President of the Nigerian Association of Foreign Students (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, said that while Nigerians in their countries face challenges, readers in Northern Cyprus have no problem, challenge or interference.
That's what the Prime Minister said in the interview.
He said it was not true that hundreds of Nigerian students died in Cyprus.
He said the death toll of 100 students was fake.
A few of them died of chronic disease, not of murder.

Zailani added: "It is not true that it is not desirable to say, when you go to other places of worship, you hear their leaders urging them and promoting them hatred of their fellow citizens who do not belong to their own religion.
The same is true of conflicts between people.
In the end, he said that unity must be restored and that religious leaders must teach the followers of Almighty God's message as it comes in our religious books, there will be no peace.
In the same way, the demon representing Kaduna Central, Father Sani, who attended the meeting, appealed to those who were not residents of Kaduna to use their voices before speaking.
The conflict has been going on for over 40 years.
For the first time, a soldier was killed by a sword and the problem was solved.

It is now being used to track down and pay for their services.

The N-Power protest against the suspension of the Sadiya minister in Abuja
Hundreds of youths who attended the rally to protest the suspension of N-Power's nationwide support programme in Abuja on Friday said it was a poor decision to suspend the youths by the government.
The youths marched all the way to the National Assembly to express their opposition to the suspension of the program in the short term.
One of those who attended the rally and a representative from Kano State, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES HAUSA, testified that they were calling on the government to delay the decision and pay those who had not yet been paid their three-month stipend.
Then they called for the money to be given to them to see that the youths had long benefited from this government support.
After meeting with some of the lawmakers who heard the outcry, they went to the Federal Civil Service Unit to discuss whether they would meet with the Minister of National Aid, Sadiya Farouk.
A prominent human rights activist, Komared Mustapha Soron Dinki, who travelled from Kano to Abuja with the youths, said the rally was to remind the minister that those who benefit from the program have been denied their rights before being suspended.
Early in the morning, the children were in the

Just as farmers are on the verge of taking advantage of their crops in Nigeria, farmers in the Sokoto State area have started to struggle against the threat of birds, which could hinder the expected harvest.
The fear of redbirds in the Sokoto State area is returning to normal, see that there are signs of a good food season in 2020.
Some farmers in the area had to adopt a traditional strategy of expelling the birds as described by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the farmers in the area, said the birds were now tending all the plants that were beginning to be harvested in the fields.
The Chairman of the Nigeria Farmers Association, Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minnata, said that two-thirds of Sokoto State is currently suffering from this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of local government areas in the state to compile a report to be sent to the state and federal ministries of agriculture to take action to help farmers.
The official of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the Department of Avian and Avian Infectious Diseases, Ya'u Makari Kagara, has said that no more than one month has passed since the completion of the avian influenza vaccine in the Sokoto region.
He added that the birds are imported from the Republic of Niger and Benin, and international trade must wait for an agreement before the problem can be tackled together.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-killing project in the 12 northern states of Nigeria that are neighboring and foreign countries through which the birds enter Nigeria.
However, a re-emergence of this problem could turn the clock's hand back to the advances seen in agriculture that governments claim are giving it special attention.

There is also a need to reduce the number of people inside and outside the home.
The government said it supports the health minister who has called for a halt to free testing for overseas returnees.

A new COVID-19 policy will be introduced in the United States.
While figures show that the number of people infected with COVID-19 continues to increase in the United States, on Monday, Republicans in the Senate are expected to present a bill of support.
It is estimated that the subsidies will cost $1 trillion to ease the strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days ahead of the end of the first financial aid pledge for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of discussions with Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. House of Representatives Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary-Mali Steven Mnuchin said the funding included an expansion of the scheme to provide funds to those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see 70% of the money given to them in the past.
On Friday, the first grant period will end when a package of funds is paid to those who have lost their jobs, and 600 per week is paid back to the state.
"Republicans complain that the scheme means some people who are paid to earn more than they are paid when they are working, when the federal government and the state are combined to pay for them.
But Democrats on their own side, have challenged the ikrai, saying that while the coronavirus pandemic is on the rise, some workers are not safe enough to return to their jobs.
Why did I go back to APC after leaving the PDP?
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nigeria Yakubu Dogara has explained why he switched from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC after the caretaker chairman of Mai Mala Buni's party announced his return to their party.
In a letter to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his Bogoro constituency, Dougara said the collapse of the leadership in his Bauchi State under the administration of Bala Mohammed who helped him succeed was the reason he left the party.
He said he could not open his mouth and ask how the state government was run unless he was accused of disobedience, so he threw his shoes at the party.
The former Speaker said that if he put his hands on the war that everything on how things are going in Bauchi State under the administration of Bala Muhammed would become a traitor, after at the time Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar heard his voice and made his point if he went wrong.
The Federal Government has launched an agricultural programme for food production and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture for Food and Agriculture Production (AFGP) Program, which is a branch of the Sustainable Economic Development Program.
The program is designed to help farmers reduce the cost of living due to the coronavirus pandemic.
This information came from the mouth of the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, at the launch of the program in Katsina.
The announcement was made by the Press Spokesman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, on Thursday.
This initiative will address the plight of people affected by the coronavirus outbreak in the country and around the world.
The programme will also further stimulate farmers' access to food development, rehabilitation and transportation routes in Nigeria.
According to the Minister, the launch event represented more than 1,100,000 smallholder farmers across the country.
He said these smallholder farmers, more than 1,100,000, were part of the Farmers' Group under six companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
We will soon be defining the second category of B, of those who will benefit from this agricultural scheme.
Nanono recalled how President Muhammdu Buhari set up the Committee on Economic Recovery and Relief from the Deprived after the Coronavirus Outbreak.
He said one of the country's economic recovery strategies, including the AFJP Program, was that the program would boost agriculture from being a hand-fed-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-farm-to-farm-farm-farm-food producer.
He said the plan included the government's plan to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food into a plan to free the poor from food shortages and hunger during the coronavirus outbreak.
He said that in one year, the initiative is expected to inform 5 million to 10 million young people about employment.
It will provide food to about 10 million metric tons per hectare from 20,000 to 100,000 per state, for at least 2.4 million farmers.
There is a need for people to know the 2019 legal code - the KCSF.
The 2019 Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in collaboration with the European Union (EU), the British Council, and the anti-corruption and anti-corruption organisation Rule of Law and Anti-corruption, is a joint initiative of the British Council.
The meeting, which took place at the Aminu Kano Democracy and Research Center in Mumbaya House, reviewed the new laws and how they are administered to the community organized by 150 civil society organizations in Kano and journalists.
Addressing the Chief Procurator, Dr. Nuhu Musa Idris, of the Legal Education Department of Bayero University Kano, he commented on some of the more complex laws.
He called for a review of some of the older laws as a result of contemporary jurisprudence.
On his part, the Chairman of the Kano State Civil Society Forum (KCSF), Ibrahim Wayya, said the lack of awareness of the laws played a major role in undermining the rights of the people and the need to know how they are.
Some of the participants of the event, which was the third such event organized, in the three Senators' Zones of Kano, from civil society groups described how they viewed the legislative process and their message.
Our representative, Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the self-awareness meeting, told us that the problems of certain strict laws that society faces are discussed.
Those who are often unaware of their rights over them, being that the law has over 400 laws, that make up their personal phone details.
The New Places of Worship Registration Act in Nigeria is being debated.
SERAP, an advocacy group for human rights and economic development called SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urge Nigeria's Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Executive Director of the Nigeria Public Service Commission to suspend plans to start the registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this action is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's move, various religious leaders had also complained to the Buhari administration that the bill would be re-examined and approved by lawmakers, thus preventing it from interfering with the country's constitutionally mandated freedom of religion and welfare.
Pastor Yohanna Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna State, told the U.S. House of Representatives that the law was not well-founded, even if the government was seeking a ban on worship or the imposition of restrictions.
It should only use methods by monitoring and tracking all violators without introducing a new law.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, pastor of the University of Science, Minna, said that although there is nothing wrong with the government monitoring companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean that it is determined to allow the freedom of one person or another to be curtailed.
Now it's up to the government to listen.
How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to crush the PREMIUM TIMES page on the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has sponsored a petition to block access to the site PREMIUM TIMES, Nigeria's leading online newspaper.
This cross-platform web browser, the internet, has done any strategy that hackers follow on people's sites to get into their sites, but it has not been successful.
He first attempted to infiltrate the hack, "hacking" since February 28, where he planted his deadly weapons on the campus of the University, and carried out his attacks using the "data" of the university.
On the other hand, if he tries to hack into the Internet's database of PREMIUM TIMES and computer, he then attacks his GSM phone again.
He spent five days closing the door to the site of the Premium Times, but was unsuccessful, despite the fact that he used a variety of modern weapons.
It failed to penetrate, as the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had a copy of its plan, which built the projector and a gate-like gate that was not broken by a militant enough.
PREMIUM also has a number of state-of-the-art web security agencies including PREMIUM TIMES Warlord and PREMIUM TIMES Chief Executive Officer, PREMIUM TIMES Website Shield.
These security operatives have the modern-day experience of cracking down on any gang or bard who seeks to undermine it alone, or make a martyr's attempt to invade the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The following are some of the ways in which the Internet has been used to protect the privacy of users:
At 8 a.m. he began to ride around the front door of PREMIUM TIMES, because he saw how he was going to bombard the building, completely destroying the building.
Had it failed in the night, and the next morning, at 6:15 a.m. he again auditioned, this time using "WPScan", which is being done in order to detect the strength or lack of robust security measures for large Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
Just 90 minutes later, he began an attempt to penetrate the technological prowess of the computer's latest technology, the "custom script".
In the morning, however, he did all he could to get his hands on the computer to get his hands on the time machine.
How the farmer treated the owner of the city:
This hacker is not aware that PREMIUM TIMES has tried to provide treatment for rats and big cities entering the fields of their modern social networking sites by blocking the page or hijacking the page.
This lack of awareness makes all the premium products that he has used, completely obsolete looks that can't do any harm to PREMIUM TIMES.
On the same day he suffered in vain and tired because he pursued a DDOS attack on the NTP Likau Range, which is an ancient road used since Kano of the village.
On March 3, he made every strategy he had left in his mind and imagination, but all was unsuccessful.
This attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Grand Lodge came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of a bitter standoff between President Muhammadu Buhari's Adviser in the Security Sector, Babagana Monguno and the former Chief of Staff to the Presidency, the late Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, have advised PREMIUM TIMES that the university has recruited a number of large-scale army-run rats on its Internet-enabled sites to target, corrupt or disrupt the main site of PREMIUM TIMES.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, she distanced herself from this attempt to attack the Great Web PREMIUM TIMES Forum.
It's just a matter of time before a student at the university tries to make a statement, not a statement.

It's a matter of courage and courage, and it's what's in your heart - The San Diego Union-Tribune
The village of Longyuan in the Hongsipu region of Wuzhong city in Ningxia state is part of the Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China.
There was a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who was famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that, with effort, perseverance and self-seeking, it is a matter of the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, had never been in a class with the intention of taking a lesson, which made her unable to read normally.
But God gave her the gift of wisdom, skill, and wisdom that she had accumulated, and she was an example in the field of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madame Li Yaomei, had suffered from gestational diabetes, leading to her having undergone surgery three times.
After her recovery again, she was met with a terrible accident, and now she was walking with the iron placed in her legs.
These challenges have thrown her into a difficult situation in addition to the health, and even the issue of medical treatment, why she took a loan of about 3 thousand yuan, the equivalent of more than N16 million.
To her surprise, this challenge faced by the Sadiya Teacher became a way of cheering and cursing to see her improve her life.
The support of the Chinese government has made her more disillusioned.
Her job is to create a variety of different types of
Because of her husband's efforts, her father's career flourished, with various ministries giving her the order to grow.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her to simplify the work.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to attach a single large snap, but now at this time, it will attach up to 5 snaps.
In addition to that, she has created additional machines that clean the grass and restore the seeds.
Then there are more machines that clean women's pet food, and these machines are still being sold to seekers.
Given the challenges that Teacher Sadiya has faced, and the efforts that she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must be with the recipient.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of life is not something that hangs its roots on the government.
If the government were to continue to provide support, but the people were not convinced or interested in improving their lives by seeking their own employment based on their situation, then only the future would be pursued without achieving any objective.
Her story shows that running a business or income-generating activity does not require any financial resources or travel to other cities or foreign countries.
Because she took into account her circumstances, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Moreover, Sadiya's teacher carried out these activities on the basis of standing on her feet without relying on her husband, in order to escape and leave her.
In other words, self-discipline and self-discipline are at work.
He then demonstrated the power of women to change their lives and stand on their feet without asking for anyone's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, no matter what one does, one should stand on one's own feet, because one's dependence on another is uncertain.
Indeed, the Sadiya teacher was a brave, intelligent and resourceful person who set an example and a lesson for the rest of the public.
Also, by March of this year, Teacher Sadiya had completed payment of all outstanding debts, and also stopped receiving government subsidies on her own initiative.

There are fears that U.S. politicians will undermine efforts to curb COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has recently expressed concern over the measures taken by some countries to preserve the COVID-19 respiratory vaccine that is expected to be produced, stating that vaccination should be avoided in communities of different countries, while sharing the vaccine.
And the vaccine should be distributed in an appropriate manner around the world, as it would be suitable for the great enjoyment of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are pursuing a policy of prioritizing self-interest over the sharing of vaccines, as well as disrupting international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In addition, more than 800,000 people have lost their lives as a result of the disease.
Under such a harsh environment, more emphasis is being placed on the impact of the vaccine, and the good news is that, in recent times, there has been a significant increase in the study of the vaccine in some countries, a phenomenon that has produced skin, and a belief in the inclusion of the entire international community.
Sadly, however, some U.S. politicians have expressed a desire to seize the vaccine.
The magazine "Science" explained that the U.S. government has already delayed the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several drug companies.
Although the U.S. government's policy has been understood to be that the U.S. is at the forefront of the spread of the pandemic, other developing countries also need vaccines, considering that they are more likely to suffer from a shortage of health resources.
The magazine "The Economist" also pointed out that, if the United States achieves the goal of eliminating the vaccine to be produced, the number of vaccines to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
The head of the African Centre for Disease Control (CDC), Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if the vaccine has been successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, until the distribution of the vaccine is planned, which is a very important issue for the international community.
It is important for the international community to strengthen cooperation
The Director-General of the WHO, Tedros, also pointed out that, if it is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be prevented from all walks of life around the world, it is impossible for some parts of the world, or a few countries, to achieve the goal of recovery from the impact of their pandemic alone.

Prosecutor Tope Akinyade, summoned them to the magistrate's court in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to prosecute them for violating the ban on house arrest imposed by the Federal Government at the time.
He said there was gross injustice to Nigerians who were caught and sentenced during mandatory domestication, but also to some groups of people who violated the law, none of them were convicted.

There is also the Spokesperson of the Presidential Villa, Garba Shehu, Social Media Officer, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Adviser on Security Affairs, Babagana Monguno, Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and several other key government figures.
Justice Celestine Odo sought to show that the plaintiff had made a mistake since the defendants had not signed his petition.
However, Tope reminded the Magistrate that he had brought the case directly to the court and had not made any follow-up action through the police.
He said it was the duty of the judges to send all the petitioners to participate.
He did what Nigerian law gave him the right to appeal to the court.
The judge adjourned the hearing and ordered that the case be returned to the court on August 4, in order to continue the hearing.

This is a unconstitutional practice, calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing investigations into several government offices, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.
According to a statement by the party's chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they would like the president to suspend the investigation but to cover up matters.

Gunmen abducted students in Chukun Local Government Area, Kaduna.
Local communities in Udawan, Chukun Local Government Area said that in addition to the six students who were taking the WEAC test who were abducted, there were also some people who had not been released for months.
Bandit attacks in some areas of Kaduna State have deprived communities of access to schooling, but the Kaduna State government has said it is doing everything it can to end the attacks, the Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said.
Gun attacks in rural areas have prevented many farmers from entering farms, which some fear could lead to food shortages in Nigeria.
The corruption of the Katsina Government and the Bandits is a theft of the money of the poor, according to the lawmaker Ummaru Abdullahi - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We must return to the truth and peace in Nigeria.
The former President of the National Court of Higher Education, Shariah Umaru Abdullahi (Walin Hausa) has stated that the reconciliation with the Katsina State Government, was carried out by bandits, a major mistake and a waste of money for the poor.
Because he did not have any influence or sign of ending the killings of bandits who had terrorized Katsina State.
Justice Umaru Abdullahi disclosed this during a special interview with journalists at his Katsina residence, including Leadership Today.
After laying the foundation for the construction of the Women's and Children's Hall, a twenty-five-bed carrier, to be built by a businessman at the Katsina City General Hospital, who is the President of the event.
The former President of the National Court of Appeal, added that the settlement made with the gun, should not be implemented.
Because of this, the terrorist is said to have brought a gun in debt of two hundred and fifty thousand, and when he returned to the forest, he bought a rifle of AK 47.
Hausa's view was that the whole world should not be successful, but should be reconciled with them by improving the lives of the herders, that is, by providing them with pastures, schools, drinking water and health facilities.
Even the Ministry of Animal Welfare is located in the northern province, and every year the Government at every level budget not only the farmers, but their herders besides them, must come to a fair and just settlement, and then there will be a sustainable peace.
But this war will not give birth to this country by the Son of the Beholder, because they are all citizens of this country, reconciliation is the only way.
It is done with the right intention, and there will be peace.
We should not be affected by this
Our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have a great future.
There has never been a war in the world with a gun on the table.
Security experts say that the terrorists have not been reconciled, this is a glaring suggestion, because even if America says it does not reconcile with the terrorists, they are their own terrorists not American citizens, the people of a country are attacking the aggressors.
We're also a nation of immigrants, and we're not going to let them get away with it.

South Africa's president has said he is optimistic about corruption in the ruling ANC party.
Cyril Ramaphosa, in a letter sent to all members of the ANC on August 23, began a dispute over contracts to help the country fight the coronavirus pandemic.
What saved you was that there were private companies and other people, including government officials who used the problem of medical, social and economic resources to provide for themselves, according to the letter.
This deception by millions of South Africans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing daily hunger, and unemployment, will not be forgiven.
In his letter Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of the country’s currency had been identified that should be used to improve transportation, provide basic amenities for the poor, as well as improve the electricity supply, help the developing black farmers and develop the country as a whole, which the wicked have put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said that the public should not think that the ANC is a means of gaining only power, or wealth and power in the country.

The commission listed reasons for the problem, including the forced relocation of people across the country, bans on passenger traffic, bans on flights, and the closure of schools and markets.
The commission added that such measures have caused the price of oil to fall, while the industry in the world has been shut down to tackle the problem.
Last May, Nigeria's Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said that the Statistics Authority had predicted a fall in such circumstances, as a result of these problems that prevented the conduct of day-to-day operations, forcing the government to tighten its budget.

The suspect said a new branch chief, who was brought to the police station, had recently ordered an officer named Funsho to allow him to bathe.
He said the officer warned him not to attempt to escape while he was in the shower, adding that at the time he did not even think to escape.

I climbed up the stairs and climbed the wall.
The people in the area saw me when I was running away but they did not expose me.

He said he travelled as far as Ibadan with three of his friends with the intention of hunting down the perpetrator for three days.
Upon reaching the state, they spread their love in a hotel where they spent the night before they went looking for him.
It was gathered that the three men followed him to where he bought a tavern in the city, but they decided not to arrest him because of the crowd in the area.
He was later captured by the villagers while he was alone in his cave.

According to Gadaka.
On the other hand, he said that the company has gained the support of the dairy industry because of the state government's efforts to revive the company's production of flour and feed mills in Potiskum and other businesses dealing with the products produced by the company.
