Come on in!
Sam's car was very nice.
Let's sing you.
The love lives.
Close your eyes.
Is there anyone you want to see?
How am I going to explain it?
He left on October 20th.
You're thirsty?
- How much?
I want to have someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV anymore.
"Mary and Mary helped me.
Sam was sitting on his lap.
I think it takes courage to do that.
Tom and Mary were married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a little while.
Let's go swimming with cold water.
October 20, 2013 is the year.
Tom nodded in agreement.
Show them.
You look like you're a lurker.
It reminds me of Italy.
It's the 3rd of October.
He's busy.
The snow is black, and the snow is white.
No one cares who you are.
They're scaring your writing.
I'm very very happy.
Someone's been stealing from me.
I'll wake you up in the morning.
Who was the first football player in the world?
You don't have any clues as to the truth.
In the power of YOU!
You must be eating a lot.
It's an insult to the people.
Do you know of anyone who speaks French?
Are you going to read today?
It's our turn!
We're eating meat.
He's been drinking twice as much as Mary.
I'd like to know who's calling.
Is there anything else you want?
Just talk to them.
You can get milk from the cows.
Get out of the Problem!
Just put them together.
You've cheated.
My life is in your hands.
I'm rooting for someone.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Goods!
I'll always remember Mary.
He didn't know Mary.
Tom was on foot.
You still don't like it, do you?
What do you have to say about what happened?
I'm taking off my clothes.
I've had a stroke.
I really don't like chicken.
My father never moved to another country.
How many books have you read?
You talk like your mother.
I laughed at Tom.
You're a gift?
it's not important.
You'd better get started right away.
What's the best location in Boston?
I've learned.
When are you going to eat?
I'm listening to music.
"I'll call you tonight.
Someone's been stealing.
I'm glad I didn't know.
A man came to my house last night.
Tom didn't shake his head.
"I'm not busy today.
Do you like Tom's?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Try to get him to leave early.
Stay away from the fire.

Mary fought in front of everyone.
Have another one.
If you need me, give me a call.
they won't help.
Don't let me break your head.
Can you spell it out?
He prayed for Tom.
Please tell me where he lives.
I think he's thirsty.
He leaned over him, and he was bruised.
We got married on the 20th of October.
I'm sure they were wrong.
I'd like to eat some peanuts.
She didn't know where Mary lived.
Do you like science fiction films?
They're speaking French.
It's better to tell the truth.
"Shut the window!
They eat these things.
Tom knows it very well.
Error!
You're kidding me like that?
No one knows what the future holds.
Somebody's got to do it.
He gave the teacher an apple.
You're sleeping?
He seems to be strong.
I'm glad Tom was caught.
Did you learn how to cook or anything else?
The flavor of the fruit is green.
I wonder where they are.
I understand.
I wish I could have done something like that.
He doesn't live in Spain.
You're at home.
Hurry up or you'll get off the train.
I met a guy who knew me.
Take a closer look.
I love the pop music.
No one's ever said that.
They're all frowned upon.
She's a cat, this cat is a cat.
Do you go to school by train?
"Why do people lie?"
One day, I'm going to buy a new car for my grandfather.
Do you think we'll succeed?
Look at it again.
There was no one inside.
I wish him a good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think it's his opinion.
Take a look at my new car.
Stop the CRASH!
This place has been captured.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sam is quick to respond on Facebook.
Someone's broken the door.
I don't read music.
I don't know where he is.
I've been in rain.
Oh, I know.
What kind of paper do you want?
You're worrying.
Do you work in Australia?
You disobeyed.
I can't write this properly.
Your father's got a plan.
He sat on the bed next to Mary.
The Qur'an says: "And the people of the land went out from among the people of the lands, and from among the people of the land of Madinah, and from among the people of Madinah, and from the people of Madinah, and from the people of Madinah, and from the people of Madinah, and from the people of Madinah, and from the people of Madinah."
Where's your Grandmother?
My sister is a very pretty girl.
"Are you Anna?"
"Please, find it.
"Stay here until you get here."
"Did you see your table?"
You're a hunchback?
"Look, kid, I'm going to call myself that.
My food is here.
She's been through two rounds.
Send me a message right now.
There's someone waiting for you.
Tom was running.
He came to visit Mary.
Who's been speaking?
There was no money in my pocket.
The animals were terrified of them.
Tom is very kind.
Love has ruined you.
everybody knows it.
Please, please, please help me to open the door.
Can you give me a copy?
Get your hands off me.

Do you hear me?
Nfares.
He's going to fix everything.
We forgot it.
Tom's going to New York tomorrow.
Mary was dressed in Halloween costumes for her children.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?

Take all of it.
You know the names of the men I have assigned to you in the city of Isra<0xC3><0xAB>l.

A lot of people love you.
The rest is outside.

I can't remember your name.
It's time for the day to come.
And I like to swim.
Tom is swimming.
"Leave Tom alone.
If it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it.
He didn't know Mary.
What's bothering you is hurting me too.
Who's books are these?
"Why do you want a car?"
You don't mess with me!
I hope no one has seen you.

Can I ask you a question that doesn't make sense?
are you here?
I'm not here to hurt you.
"Who did you give the book to?"
Go and see if there's anyone who can help.
It started to snow.

I know that sound.
I've given you confidence.
Let's hope it doesn't happen again.

Can you come back at 9 a.m.?
He's going to clean it up.
Your life is different from mine.

I can't take care of you.

Come back at once.
Where did you go?
He turned to Mary.
She's hit us.

You're a British?
There's someone there.
I'm sure someone or someone else said that.
Everybody's watching.
It's a pretty good one, isn't it?
The dog eats almost everything.
I don't want to wake up!
"Shut the window.
Why don't you take it to our store?
"Did you read everything?"
That's a trip!
I can teach you how to read.
You're very sensitive to the problem.
I'm going to make some complaints.
I don't want to read it tonight.
Hold on to your ass!
You can eat pork whenever you want.
There's someone watching.
The machine didn't turn out well.
"Who invited you to the party?"
So, what are you talking about?
I didn't find it.
I think he's afraid of Tom.
You're married?
Thank you for telling us that.
Who's dead?
Sam was talking a lot.
You're drinking cold water.
I will STOP.
Try this one.
"These are yours?

For you?
He lied about where he was that day.
Tom's calling.
I found the cat.
"Did you drink tea?"
- Really?
Don't let go.
What else can you do?
It's not easy because it requires a lot of money.
You're breaking my mind!
Tom doesn't have an idea.
When I'm finished with my work, I'll be back.
Ask them.
You're a foreigner?
He wasn't with Mary.
Well, who knows?
Well, something has happened.
Red wine, please.
Let's finish teaching.
What's going on with your phone?
Will you be able to stop smoking?
He put his car in the back of the car.
In peace.
Qwem waki.
Somebody's got to know Tom.
He's three times bigger than me.
Sam wasn't far from me.
The animals eat the animals.
That's how Tom does it.
Mary was reading it.
He made a living on the plane.
I told him I'd see Tom.
Eat!
He turned red.

Have you ever been to Kyoto?
You do understand, don't you?
Have you Seen This Movie?
I'll be watching you until you're dead, and I'll be watching you until you're dead.
I can't not stay.

"I was on a mountain.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Will you please tell me who I'm going to go to?
You can't.
You're a narcissist.
I'm going to be 30 in October.
You can always come back.
I'm going to call Tony at home.
- It's not good.
It's important that you do what your parents tell you to do.
Sam was gone.
Is there anyone waiting for you?
He's going fast.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I've laughed.
When do you want to eat?
I love you very much.
It hurt my back a little bit.
"Where is your God now?"
"Show me your papers!"
He didn't know what was going on there.
I'm ready
I think I can count on you.
Get yourself up close.
Zane is very happy with a lot of things.
Please don't forget about this issue.
Go and find someone who can help.
I don't think I would ever do that.
Please come to us.
He spoke calmly.
Please call her on the phone.
Are you really going to eat that?
You're crazy if you keep working in a place like this.
Please, please be calm.
What's that?
Kayla is your light.
I don't think Tom did it.
Your older sister will see you.
Everybody's seen it.
What happened to what we wanted?
I love you as you are.
Take care of yourselves.
There's someone watching Tom.
Ack-it!
Succeed!
I think I can count on you.
I want to eat now.
If I had known, I would have told you.
See you later, Sayoko.
Are you sure it's the guy you saw?
Do the best you can.
I have NOTHING to say.
They're making fun of you.
I've stopped smoking.
Champagne, please.
Who?
She laughed.
Rao is the name of the artist, but his real name is Arezzo Cebli.
Is there anything you want?
I only know English and French.
The sale of beer has been delayed.
He was angry when he tried to do that.
everyone is changing.
I know what he's doing.
Jbed!
It's hurting me here.
So let me pay for it.
this is a car.
"Can I go home now?
When are we going to do that?
I think Tom's seen it.
I know someone who's talking to you.
"Can't we talk about it in the morning?"
Look at it.
I'm sorry for Tom.
I'm too busy writing a book.
God will protect you.
I was born to love you.
be a badass.
Come here early.
I know you.
I've died tired.
She didn't want him to see her.
I'm using your language.
I'm following her.
Clean up your room.
He speaks a lot of languages.
No one's going to hate you.
What time is it in Boston?
"Give me the book.
I saw a bug.
He nodded to Tom.
Understanding.
"Look for him!
Tom's family was very happy.
There's someone who's written it now.
Mary is running.
Tom couldn't cook.
He looks like a little boy.
We hope you'll be back in New York soon.
You are John.
If you have time to read this book.
The women will come first.
I don't think they're going to believe that they're going to be affected by this.
Do you have friends who don't eat meat?
It is October 20th.
I like to read.
You're worrying.
Dremmed!
I want someone to help me do that.
Do you know?
Mary was so excited, she could have been so excited.
You're wrong.
Do you think it'll be too late?
What's a book you're reading?
It's very pretty!
Can I see you later?
She went to help Mary.
Did you ever play the game with someone else?
Please Don't Cry.
He gave the baby to Mary.
Have you ever written a book on Wikipedia?
"Are you going to eat here or not?"
We believe you.
Tom works at home.
They've got my hands.
"Why did you choose Tom?"
"Did you read this?
We will be back in Australia on March 20th.
She really likes Layla.
Why did you come so far?
The soil is cold.
"Are you going to eat dinner at home today?"
He also learned Arabic in Qatar.
It's got courage!
They want to get rich.
There's someone calling for you.
Don't let anyone burn in the fire.
Have you ever read "Moby Dick"?
Who's calling you, please?
Give it to someone else.
Scared?
Have you read this book yet?
That's why Tom didn't do that.
You're a foreigner?
He said he wanted to do it, but he didn't.
I've lost words.
We're so lucky to have them working for us.
"When did you get back from Boston?"
Mary's hiding.
They tried to get me married.
Yes, that is true.
You're a German?
We know you're lying.
You are WRONG.
Tom is going to die.
You can talk about the weather at any time.
You're asleep?
Is the U.S. back from Russia yet?
Have a good blog next to you.
I can understand why she did it.
Why isn't anyone helping me?
I'm respecting you.
He left for Boston at the end of October.
Do you want to speak French?
There's someone in Tom's room.
He turned his back on the back of his head.
I'm so sad that I can't learn all the languages of the world.
Football is a different game.
Please don't leave me.
Let's start a fight.
It's not impossible!
I told him I'd wait for him.
English is a language that no one will ever eat.
You can't wait here alone.
You shouldn't be afraid of that.
The servant saw a light in the distance and was happy.
Tom's contract expires on October 20.
Tom is very rich.
Eating with you is not easy.
I will do my best to avoid spoiling your books.
"When did Tom leave?"
That's a good question.
"Do you want to be a pilot?" "Who's not?"
I do that every day.
We've got to do something.
But I'm Irish.
Sam came home on a lunch break.
You're very close!
How do we get to this situation?
It's a story that's always been told, but it's never easy.
By please.
He's never talked about you before.
I really like to play golf.
He's going to be 30 years old in October.
"Why do people lie?"
I didn't know he had many friends.
You're a fool!
Loves the one who's got it.
Are you new to it?
What's been stolen?
Keep your eyes up.
Lhan?
He wants someone to look at him.
The dictionary is of no use.
It's very high Tom.
Maybe there's something you know.
If you want a better place, you don't have to wait.
No one answered.
She wants to buy books.
Theggam?
Do you have a little sister?
You're going to have a little sister.
I've had three fish this morning.
Tom's room is always nice.
he was working.
Are you afraid of horror movies?
He was busy day and night.
I know he's a foreigner.
It's not October yet.
He told me not to buy an old car.
We'll eat later.
You've got to be careful.
What time do you have to come home?
It smells like a dog.
I thought the problem would be solved.
Give it to whomever you want.
It's a bit of a clich<0xC3><0xA9>, isn't it?
- How are you?
We've got to do something.
He's English.
You're our prisoner.
it's raining.
He couldn't sleep without the light.
You have to go back home.
I need to speak with someone.
Stop it now!.
Don't talk to Tom.
With their power.
Let me know if there is any change.
Please take a step forward.
Tom and I think the same thing.
What do they want from them?
Tom was Mary's husband.
He said he would leave the door open.
you're there?
You'll find the car keys in your room.
They told me not to do that.
Tom is a good teacher.
I'm going to let Mary do that.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
People are afraid of war.
They want to come back.
I love you very much.
You're speaking?
He may have done so on October 20.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
It's a place where plants die.
The Eagles are dead.
Tell them.
Help yourself to.
He's always yelling at me.
Tom's writing something.
They kissed each other in love.
I'd like to pay for it, please.
I don't think like you.
I heard the door open.
He was so sad that he didn't want to leave her.
In the 1980s, people from Poland came to Kathmandu to take care of the elephants.
Tom is angry.
Please, please to him.
"Did you call the chicken?"
Someone's been watching you.
The girl looks just like her mother.
He came back in October.
We have a lot of these things.
Just to be honest, I'm not a man or a woman.
I'd like to try something else.
You've read it all?
"Please don't die.
There was someone who knew.
You're ruining your country.
There's something I'd like to show Mary.
Look closely. I'll show you how to do it.
I haven't been to New York since October.
Tom nodded his head.
I'll buy you something to eat.
This test is something we can do.
Go and find Tom.
There's no doubt!
Tom tried to hit Mary with a knife.
"I wanted to do that," Tom said.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom died in Boston when he was 30 years old.
Take these.
Tom voted for it.
Tom seems so small.
My dog has a long tail.
He looked like he was drunk last night.
I met a girl in high school who spoke French.
You are the Americans.
Tom's face was turned upside down.
This, you.
You're a mother to me.
Get the animals out of their cages.
I'll buy it for you.
You have to stop apologizing.
I know you don't want to doubt me.
You've annoyed me!
He went to Boston.
There's someone watching us.
He refused and didn't want to.
He didn't know I was hungry.
It's going to be October 3rd.
I love the pics.
I don't think that.
Welcome to the home.
But you're a dog.
Who invited you to the party?
"Where did you forget your phone?"
What do you think of his new book?
What a beautiful young man!
I don't want to brag about a man like that. But I won't brag about myself. I will brag only about how weak I am.
Yes, sin.
You've got to read this.
No one can see me like that.
I walk in the dark.
"I can teach you how to sing.
My father used to travel.
He hated Mary.
I'm not your servant!
Why do you eat so much like that?
Have you gone mad?
Thank you for your hearing.
I just want to buy my new car.
Where I've been?
They're adorable.
What kind of paper do you want?
That's where you got it wrong.
It's still three months from now.
I hope it will always be like this.
Bring on more.
Tom was starting to get tired.
Stay for a while.
Of course, you're all wrong.
A lot of houses were on fire.
Why didn't they say anything?
Tom stayed with one of them.
I'm afraid we won't be early.
My mother's father is my grandfather.
No one knows.
You're always together.
There is NOTHING there.
Keep on running!.
I hope you've learned from your mistakes.
You have to write a novel.
Someone's been calling you.
I'd rather work at night.
This is Nina, your son's daughter.
You're playing sports?
You're yours.
He didn't take your word for it.
"You're rich?
Don't forget about us!
You're finished?
We're done.
Above all, be kind to the elderly.
"That's your slave, isn't it?"
I didn't hate to lose.
Someone has to go first.
Sam was riding in the back of the car.
I hope that you will listen to me.
Welcome.
They're on Facebook.
I Bought It.
they don't need anything.
Have something.
Tom answered.
There's a lot of broken pieces.
He'd never given anyone a kiss.
Everyone was talking.
Tom knows you're lying.
So, what else?
You talked to them, didn't you?
What to say!
I'm going to go in October.
You're crying out.
In the Power of YOU!
He didn't know I was here.
"There will be no more death," said Titus.
You're all a mess.
You were praying.
It's all clear!
I know you're quite right.
"I'll call you before I leave."
"I can't swim with you today."
He drinks a lot of water.
Close your book.
If you're being bullied by someone, don't worry.
"Why are you crying?
She's reading.
She likes it Mary.
He used to wake up early.
He's grown his hair.
Look at it.
He was murdered by Mary.
you know the way.
What do I do if I want to go to Boston?
Write in spanish.
You'll have to ask someone else.
He ain't stupid.
Because it's so heavy, I can't stand it.
Please don't be angry.
Oh, what beautiful flowers!
How do you not know?
Kathmandu still lives in South Africa during the time of the Ottoman Empire.
It looks like we should do it.
Listen up, boys.
"Stop the fight.
They've got a problem.
Wash the apples before you eat them.
He said he wanted to learn French.
Tom is swimming.
Maybe they're sleeping.
We have a good team at home.
"Shut your mouth!
I've burned out something that's broken.
Let's go!
I'd like to show you some of the books I've written.
I don't know him.
Tell him that I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one has seen you.
mine is bigger than yours.
I've said what I've been hiding.
I love the Lilly's.
"Shut it up!
I arrived in Boston on October 20th.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom has been kidnapped.
Keep on running!.
Someone's going to do it.
Go and get it.
This section is broken down into three sections each day.
Tom is sick.
Make it a small one.
- How are you?
Are you dodging me?
His eyes are red.
I'm surprised Mary didn't do that.
You're thirsty?
Tom nodded.
I left my keys in the car.
I'll wait outside.
"Do you like my friend?"
No one's listening.
I'm hurting my neck.
"Why don't you come here Tom?"
The police believe that Tom was shot with a knife before cutting his throat.
She didn't know what Mary was thinking.
No one will remember.
What's your father's story?
Faith is not faith. It's a principle that makes people believe.
I won't let you leave.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are so beautiful.
"Can you speak French?"
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What Are You Doing?
HELP me.
He forgot Mary's phone number.
I'm happy for you, aren't I?
I speak French better than you.
He followed me on Snapchat.
I saw one of them with Tom.
Tom, send it to me.
He is one of the most famous in Japan.
Teslerkis.
You're cold?
Don't let yourself go unscathed.
Tom is the son of a well-known Boston schoolteacher.
Can we say it, no?
I bought a new piece of bread.
They're not the ones who come back.
Why is it such a bad thing?
You're my prisoner.
You're worried now?
Forget it.
We're not busy now.
Where did you get this piece of furniture?
Do you want me to call her?
I'm looking for someone who wants to run away.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think they needed our help.
Tom didn't know I knew.
It looks good.
Your father's got a plan.
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Tom leaned against the table.
Leave it.
That's right.
Oh, how I miss you!
Tom knocked on the door again.
You're an idiot?
Tom's never going to change.
He asked someone to give him something to eat.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her when she lived in London.
Somebody's gone.
The cat is back.
How's it going in Australia?
He likes to talk about art.
"I need you to do something.
He didn't talk about Layla.
Let me see what you've written.
Tom saw it, too.
leave it to him.
Tom wasn't married.
He was looking for his pen.
They understand.
They will be closed after October 20th.
I am waiting to have a baby.
I can't see it well.
Just shut up.
Hello. Hello.
I don't have money in my pockets.
The sky is a great place for people.
They all left.
You've betrayed me.
I hope no one has seen you here.
No one's ever seen you come here."
Why didn't we let you do that?
I have only one question.
We don't use it unless it's necessary.
I'm hoping to play the guitar.
Hold on to your shit!
Come along with me.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't know how to speak French.
He gave her a hug to Mary.
read it.
Say "hello" to me.
Oh, how I miss you!
Somebody's got to pay.
I love to watch western movies.
He hated Mary.
Please, please be quiet.
She's beautiful.
He has a lot of good ideas.
Banned.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We don't have anything to eat.
Are you ready to leave?
Sam went into the store.
Laugh at it, please.
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
He said he would be back on October 20th.
Have a calm.
Call her if you have any questions.
I'm going now, please.
We all hate you.
he can go.
What kind of paper do you need?
"Follow me, Tom!
No one's ever seen you come here.
"Your father's going to dinner with you tonight?"
I'm leaving for Australia on October 20th.
She LOVES her.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
Drive.
Tom's response showed me that he was doing well.
He's sitting in his father's room.
We need to make sure that the law is enforced in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in schools, and in the workplace. This is the law that applies to all of our citizens.
When will you come to see me?
The coronavirus has come to a head.
Just tell her what she needs.
That's easy.
I'll go with you.
"Did you go crazy?
He was in front of Mary.
Just do what I've done!
You're wrong.
Tom built a beautiful house.
"Someone stole my money."
They're afraid of your writing.
I lied when I said I didn't like it.
No one stood up.
I'm going to start work in July.
There are many things we can do to help our families.
I do not understand something.
I'm going to insulate Mary.
Tom took out the car.
Mary's words were easy to understand.
They're making fun of you.
You're speaking my language.
I'm very happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we came to visit Mary.
If you have time to read this book.
Well, I'll see him tomorrow.
You have to answer me as soon as possible.
Tom is very lucky.
What I'm going to say!
She asked Mary.
It's a long way.
Try and use it.
You're ready?
Someone's watching us.
"You remind me of someone.
Put down your pillows.
We want to get to know you.
Don't you all like music?
I've been busy.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Quickly put on your clothes.
So, what do you want?
He got up.
I'm the one who missed Mary.
Very good!
They all sat down.
"Wait for something!
Don't you understand it?
I've got your number.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary knew they had to do the same.
They're searching for me.
Let's go!
"You're an alien?
A lot of people are waiting.
He said goodbye to Mary.
"Follow your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say goodbye to your friends and friends.
Probably not.
Tom is broken up.
He knew that Mary was following him.
he was running.
It's coming from Tom.
Read this book.
He said he didn't want to give up.
They're still following us.
What time do you want to come home?
"Did someone get hurt?"
I hope no one has seen you here.
Tom has arrived.
This party isn't for you.
You're the one who built a house with bricks and bricks.
Everybody knows it.
No one wants to be spoiled.
I've brought you some food.
Tom started to sing to me.
Will you let us go now?
The river was very wide.
Read this book.
I can't take it off.
I like it a lot.
I've heard what happened.
Ellie and I haven't been together for six years.
You've been crazy?
He hates the Algerian people.
I'm following the thread.
That's my phone.
I will be staying in Boston until the end of October.
Do you care what people think of you?
I've been posting on Facebook every Tuesday.
Sam is a criminal.
If you want to go, go now!
I've seen you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
He said he wasn't talking to you.
You're very sensitive, please.
"We've met before?"
She speaks 10 different languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's fast against time.
That's all we have.
I think I understand it.
It's a little hot today.
She's my sister, isn't she?
Tom was burned.
She's always thinking about Mary.
Tom doesn't care about you.
What beautiful dreams.
He said he had never driven a car before.
Is there anyone who has seen anything?
I know it's billions of dollars.
Tesmiger.
That'll warm you up.
I'm hoping it's a dream.
Love has ruined you.
You've pissed me off!
Who's been complaining?
"Are you Julius?"
Do you have any other questions?
But that's not Tom.
You'll find someone.
Let's make another one.
It is Kabylie.
He didn't look at it.
Are you a human being?
All my problems have been solved.
No one's ever seen you come here.
Alice smiled at him.
I'm not really a man and a woman.
"Please close the door with the key.
Fasten your life!
I didn't want to be alone.
He said to the rock, "I will go out." He said to him, "What shall I say?"
God will give you the strength to do this.
Someone has to do that.
My son became a man.
I would like to ask an unanswerable question.
I've caught it.
He saw Tom.
You've read?
I've lost.
He sent me a beautiful poem written about his mother's death.
"Wash your lips!
They're following.
She's a good singer for Mary.
"Did you learn to cook or something else?"
He likes to play football.
He still has his guitar.
everybody loves you.
We can't both be right.
Where's your daughter?
Get out of here!
everyone's pissed off.
If you're using a second language instead of a second language, it's more likely that you'll be able to learn from your mistakes.
Did you do all of that?
Let them help you.
You're helping him?
They didn't ask for help, like Tom and Mary did.
Where there is no trust, there is no trust.
The man who broke down was angry with the man who broke down.
Tom and Mary have a father.
"Has anyone died?"
No one cared.
Tom threw it out.
you're lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing what I have to.
I've read Layla's story.
I want you to stand up.
But you refuse to pay.
Tom continued to read.
You're lying?
She liked Mary's.
You have to do this job.
I think you've done it against your will.
She's reading English.
You know me.
Are you sick?
They all helped.
Tom and Mary like John and Alice.
Selbent.
You need to talk to Tom.
Who's running?
Tom's birthday is October 20th.
You forget it.
It's a small piece of wood that has a big hole.
Tom was amazed.
"I saw a dog.
I'm very afraid.
help to me.
The festival will start in October.
Tell me who is going to help me?
I just can't leave you here.
Sam didn't know who she was.
What do you think of this fruit?
"Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do that.
I love the way you kiss me.
You've finished your work?
What's the language?
You're a very good student.
That's an art?
Maybe you'll find someone there.
Whose is it?
Aren't you shy?
He's got a lot of good ideas.
Swim!
I've been following Mary.
Don't make it too small. It's easy.
"Why do you need a knife?"
Tom's getting used to it.
Come back to us!
If you don't want to read it, stop.
You're crazy?
I bought a bottle of wine.
Let's go over there.
So let's dance.
Please. Please.
Somebody's got to do something.
They went down.
You're finished?
Maybe this book is your friend.
Mary knew that I believed her.
Now, change your clothes.
We wanted to hear it.
Aren't you happy to be rich?
Look at that. What do you think?
Tell me what you want, I don't believe you.
Your life is different from mine.
He went out that night.
Take this.
Everybody's joking.
He said that no one had seen him.
What are you going to tell your dog to eat?
But I'm not your love.
Sam went to the game.
He was married in Boston in October.
The moon was still shining.
Thank you for your call.
Someone I've seen.
Thank you so much for inviting us to dinner.
He's waiting for his turn.
He doesn't smoke anymore, he said.
You've annoyed me!
Kurt Cobain died in Seattle on April 5, 1994.
I will be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom wasn't feeling well.
Arsene Wenger saw the light.
She swims well.
I'm going to pay a fee.
The discussion is over.
"Can you hold on to Tom?"
He bought it for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
He was very upset with Mary.
Give me a tomato, please.
Hold on to your power.

But I'm a foreigner.
Someone's been eating us.
It's where he's been waiting.
In your heart?
Do you've got any girls?
He's a man who follows his parents and teachers.
Hello all again.
of the names you have.
Are You Messed Up About Me?
If you want it, you'll have something.
Switzerland is a country of railways.
It's not my language, it's my culture.
You're scared?
October has been hard.
"Did you read this?
Well, maybe not.
There's somebody inside.
I don't care if you kiss me.
It's a story I want.
open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
It's his father Tom.
He was the first to finish the test.
This time, it's no different.
I'm sorry.
it's raining.
He was visiting her when she lived in London.
Someone's been listening now.
I want to work with them.
October has been a busy month.
We've missed you all.
I've got to read.
"Take Tom home."
I'm going to eat here.
The truth is hard.
I ate.
I arrived in Boston very late.
What do you want with us?
He wants to marry Mary.
Tom couldn't drive.
Sam knows where he lives.
Why do I have to help him?
I don't want to kiss Tom.
You won't help me.
I won't be eating at home tonight.
Look at it.
You're happy.
You don't like Boston yet, do you?
He grabbed the bag and went to the market.
Hold on to this.
"How long are you going to go?
Sam was tired of it.
"Why are you crying?
"Don't worry, I don't want to see you!"
When it was dark, people went back to their homes.
They all nodded.
There was a fire in the night.
"Why are you alone?
I like the movies.
You're going to try it.
Get your hands off me.
We won't leave you.
It's good to swim.
France is a REPUBLIC.
Hold on to yourselves.
You just have to wait here.
Tom is one of them.
It was built by Mary.
Michael and Mary are smiling.
Someone was knocking at the door.
Sam used to eat a lot of food.
You're going to have a little sister.
Tom is wrong.
She's lost everything she has.
behind you.
Who's standing up?
Keep up with Tom.
He said he knew who did it.
Tom is very rich.
I didn't talk about that with her.
who knows what it is.
What's your friend's name?
"I told you it would work.
You're crazy.
You've lost your love.
It's like football in this country.
I'm not going to leave.
I'm taking my clothes off.
You're going fast!
See you, Ian.
Don't judge your loss.
Stop them.
If I recall correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Get ready!.
You're not blind?
Eat all you want.
How long are we going to wait?
It's a beautiful life.
It's windy.
Oh, what a beauty!
Why didn't you bring him home?
Tom wanted to.
The dictionary isn't all right.
You've found something?
You've come to welcome me.
You're right, Tom.
Do not seek.
You're worrying me a lot.
They're all outside.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want to do all these things?
Do you think I'm talking?
If you can't help him, no one can help you.
I really need to eat something.
I've played many times in my life.
you're hungry?
They've got a problem.
"Get your clothes on!
Tom has arrived.
"How long have you been teaching French?"
I played the guitar.
- Why not?
I'm going to ask Tom to do that.
Is there anything you've found?
I know he really loves me.
I like to sleep.
Mary and I had a similar idea.
"We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can take her back to the house tonight.
We know you didn't kill him.
Sam was in Texas.
I'm trying to get Tom to do that.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
That's love?
You've been sick?
You can see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you sad?
"I heard someone talking.
I thought it was Mary.
Who's Boy?
But we don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat per week?
Tell her what you want.
There's someone speaking.
"Did you read that?
I'm waiting for a call this morning.
What does all of this mean?
You have to follow the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What is it that you want?
Stop snoring.
It's really really sad.
I need someone to talk to.
Say "ahhh."
I don't really like Tom.
Let me see what you've written.
Keep on laughing.
He writes on paper very quickly.
We need more evidence.
You're welcome to come.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Come along with me.
be to you.
You've got a lot of time.
I'm just saying, it's been going on ever since.
Are you the only one?
I'm hoping to do that again.
There was no room in Tom's house.
Somebody has to speak.
I have respect for you.
October 20th was a great day.
It started to rain all of a sudden.
She was driving faster than Mary's.
Write your name.
somebody was killed.
No one spoke.
You can get your money back if you want.
I'm not interested in you on this.
it's our car.
"I believe you.
Do as you like.
I'm tired of watching TV.
No one ate the cake.
Will you be able to help me again?
They're all waiting.
Your success will depend on your success.
What's your teeth that hurt you?
Please come back today if you can.
He lied to Tom.
"How much food did you eat?"
Can I see the list, please?
Take care of yourself!
He was trying to save Mary.
He was sorry that he wanted to do that.
"You need someone like me."
He's your father, Tom.
I don't know I don't like that.
you're sorry?
Take it all.
It's Tom?
I didn't get to see Layla out of Walmart.
What are you going to do with that?
I didn't read it very well.
"Who invited you to the party?"
She kissed Mary.
We jumped.
I don't understand how this could happen.
The one you've got now is mine.
What do you say to him?
We're going to be neighbors.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?
He likes the French.
he stayed at home.
leave this to you.
What did you want to tell me?
The year of snow is the year of snow.
It's snowing, but it's cold.
Stop it!
I've got to find a way to get out of here.
He went to the bar to get some beer.
I think you're much older than me.
Take care of yourself.
We've got one?
Will you please shut up.
His mother believed him.
I can't do it any other way.
Hokkaido is located in the north of Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They waited.
Did you hear what they were saying?
I'm in a tempo.
"Who told you he was going to be here?"
Can you give us a call?
How are they going to know?
He immediately saw me.
Tell it to Tom.
You've found yourself?
You look like a snitch.
I seem to have arrived very early.
I've never tried to ride a bike.
He ran outside to see what was going on.
He's the kind of guy I love.
Who's going to survive?
He paused in a pause.
It was Halloween in October.
Why didn't you do something?
He gave me a lot of money.
you're new?
Get in!
He saved the cat.
You're working a lot.
Someone had come to my house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom asked for the reason.
He said he had never heard Mary sing.
Looks like I've slept.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I will never love you as much as I love you.
"Who speaks French?"
Do you have a home in Australia?
Leave them.
Tom shrugged.
Tom nodded at him.
I like to cuddle.
There was someone sleeping on the bed.
You have a copy of a book.
Mary and Joseph wanted to buy a house.
He told me that he'd seen someone give him a kiss.
I like the apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
Who's been talking?
Copy.
"I believed you.
"I'm in London here.
I Know It All.
He made me feel cold.
You've read it?
He's dead.
He came home three hours later.
He let go of his dogs.
I love you very much.
Get in the house early.
Tom went into the kitchen.
You're dead.
He probably wouldn't call us.
The apples are great.
I got caught up in.
They've succeeded.
It's easy for you to use.
You don't have a heart.
Stay where you have been.
You're an idiot!
Somebody's got to do it.
If I had known, I would have told you.
I've written a book, do you want me to read it?
"Can you help me, please?
You're testing them?
Thank you for telling us that.
This is my brother's.
They've all died.
"Is that Tom?"
Learn!
"We need a car.
I wouldn't eat fish if I didn't.
"Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom was stunned.
When I come back from the church where I pray, I like to have a glass of wine before I go to bed.
She built it.
I will be 30 in October.
In your mind's.
Tom is very heavy.
Tom stood up.
It's not a problem!
It's time to go home.
Come on over here!
He bought two of his books on Amazon.
Ax!
you're using?
He's working for you?
The words "pearl" and "pearl" are derived from the same word for "pearl": a finger that can be pruned.
The women were frightened.
You're all crazy.
Sammy is a sage.
Tom likes to speak French.
"Shut up smoking.
Is there anyone who can speak spanish.
Don't eat that.
Tom didn't see her.
Send me over there.
Who's your older brother?
That's happened sometimes.
"Why did you call?
I'm continuing to sing.
Everyone knows it's a car.
You're smoking?
He's changed his attitude a lot.
It's crazy that you're going to continue to work like this.
I understand.
Tom is screaming.
Tom didn't want to kill Mary.
Tom has changed his job.
They're the birds.
There's no hope for his future.
Turn on the light.
"Stop the fight!
I'm here as a friend.
You'd better not do that while you're here.
The girls love you both as well.
We haven't known each other for a long time.
I saw a picture of Tom.
Can you give it to me?
I'm back with Tom today.
There is nothing better than love.
I'll be in Boston until the 20th of October.
"Where did you learn Italian?"
Well, let's try something.
I'll go with you.
Don't stop crying.
"Did you see my sister?
Layla was late.
Hey, look!
And tell them the truth.
We've succeeded.
I'm not going to wash your car.
I met a man who knew his father.
I'm not here to hurt you.
They've got you.
Sam ran into the pool.
Smile.
Someone had opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready to?
I want to eat Chinese for dinner.
"Shut up your room.
You have to follow the rules.
She's a Kabylie.
We've got company tonight.
Listen to me!
The church is a part of the Albanian Prudential Church, which organizes parishes for the parishes.
You're in the kitchen.
"Someone's talking about Tom.
Do you watch TV on a daily basis?
You don't eat too fast, do you?
Life is walking.
Is there really a science to it?
I love you as you were.
He's been talking about you all day.
No one had gone there.
They've lost.
You've got to eat something.
Sya.
I asked Mr. Smith.
Your child is a better teacher than all the other children.
You can't go into that.
He seems to be fine.
He stole the money from his mother's house.
Didn't you know you're still working on it?
Tom inermes Mary.
"What time did you get here?
Have a look around you.
you're saying.
HELP us.
Who-you?
I'm just feeling it.
He didn't know Mary loved him.
They play with boys and girls.
Your eyes are deceiving you.
No one knows.
I'm listening to the music.
I'm with Tom.
He didn't ask Mary to help him.
He was arrested for writing the book.
"I know your language.
Life is short, life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
"I don't want to talk about my son.
We were married, together with Tom.
Tom is pissed off.
I didn't see him at the Halloween party.
Tutu.
we can do something.
He ran.
He's looking at Mary.
Sam stood up to pray.
Who would be in your position if you weren't there?
"Someone wanted to send me a message.
He died of cancer in October.
Looks like you know how to do that.
They're the same age.
No one told me it was so cold.
You didn't help me.
He's coming back with this.
I believe him.
October 20th was a very hot day.
There's nothing greater than the truth.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a very smart boy.
"Why did you go there?
"Where are your dogs?
He was only left in doubt.
What are you going to do this weekend?
Well, half of the work is finished.
There's something about religion.
He tried to open his eyes.
Continue to agile.
My dog is black.
Your mother's eating.
Mary Tebow.
Let me know something I don't know.
You're all right?
They love their kayak.
I know you're going to have to do that.
Someone's watching us.
I know what it is.
"Wait outside.
It really took my breath away.
I want someone to tell.
Put up the room.
You've been hiding something.
you're here?
Didn't you know that he was going to Boston with Mary?
He was afraid of Mary.
It's good to be able to agree.
You're crazy, so I did it!
It's snowing.
Someone is looking for a cat.
The snow covered the land.
Someone's been squeezing.
Tom can do what he likes.
"Please don't be angry.
"Someone stole my car."
"Did you call?
You are the love of my life.
If it's hot, it's made of olive oil.
Aren't you tired?
Don't you all like music?
I was in Boston last year.
Run in a hurry.
But I'm not your slave.
"Why did you stay alone?
No one answered.
Yes, it is.
I walk to the right.
I don't know why he didn't get the job.
I don't need your job.
Naomi was very happy when she won the prize.
She didn't kiss Mary.
We'll see you at dinner.
Tom has done a great job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
Amy likes to eat fish.
Would you pass me a drink, please?
Tom answered.
"How are you, Tom?"
It's okay, no one's stopping.
it's a good life.
I lost my pen.
Who's gone with you?
You're ready?
Do you like your trip to New York?
Tom has since dropped out.
you're there?
She got up and walked to the market.
He began to fear it.
Get out of here!
Put your shoes on before you go in.
It's going to be a couple of months since I've been writing this blog, but I'm sure Kabylia is going to be doing a lot of work. So who are we going to be writing about?
Please respond to it.
Is there anybody you want to read?
The girl was beautiful.
Don't buy any bread.
He was in prison in October.
Kiss it.
"Can I go home now?
They didn't see anything.
Tom and I haven't seen each other in a long time.
I HATE the fight.
Tom continued to read.
I didn't say he wasn't smart.
They've all found themselves.
"Stalin is dead, all the Algerians are crying.
What he said doesn't make any sense.
Mary was wearing a wedding dress.
Do you want to love us?
What's the German?
Maybe he needs to do that, too.
She kissed me.
There's somebody coming.
Mary said she didn't like him.
They've got wine.
We can!
you're dying?
She's dying of fright.
Come on over here.
Do you have a response?
You're talking about Mary.
Do you know anything about your family?
They all lived.
Do you have a brother, Anna?
Good luck to you.
No one knows why.
Is there any one to listen to?
I was so excited to get out of the phone.
If you want, you have something.
I earned $100 a day.
Tom has never forgotten.
Tom slammed the door in anger.
We are the light of sight.
He sent him a message.
Take it all.
You know very well how it happened.
Has anyone asked him what he's doing?
Tom knew it.
Let go of me!
I've heard otherwise.
The plan was approved in October.
He didn't sleep early.
Tom and Mary were in the back seat.
We're on a Saturday?
Go on.
Have a coffee.
They agreed.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I'd like to travel with you.
It's not good for your coffee.
You must come with me.
Is there anyone listening to it?
I'm going to talk to you again.
Someone's been stealing my money.
Do you know her before she joined the group?
That's good news for you.
Just ask it next to you.
I didn't dream that I was dead today.
You keep on laughing.
We slept a lot.
I didn't watch all night.
for a change of theme.
My parents are Catholics.
I would like to send this letter by air.
I've got a sore throat on the left side of my face.
We're learning French.
How did you spend your time in New York?
Tom has been drinking.
We have until October to do so.
Why didn't you come to me?
I haven't seen them since October.
Now, let's eat!
Do you like to drink?
I'm so glad you've succeeded.
You're a fool?
Tom was right.
Sam went to Egypt.
You seem to be surprised.
We'll have to keep an eye out for each other.
She doesn't smile at me anymore.
They were like snow in the sun.
Tom may have to wait.
That's not true either.
It's a test.
I've got to tell somebody.
"I'm here for you.
Tom heard the sound of the bell.
He never kissed his wife.
Look ahead.
Hey, look at that!
Tom and I talked about a lot of things.
Come on in.
Eat up.

You've tested me!
As soon as he got his first degree, he went to London.
They had a shop on Sunday.
read the article.
We are in Tel Aviv.
I want you to shut the door when you leave.
It's not a bad idea, but it's a good reminder to remember when you're older than you are.
Thank you for your kindness.
Fill it out for Tom.
Give it to Tom.
Let me go!
When you're done eating, brush your teeth.
Don't worry about me.
So, you're Japanese?
Bring a well-deserved.
They were not all famous.
We'll go when it rains.
Someone's waiting for you.
It's new?
Do you understand?
It's smelly.
I'm crazy for you.
It's amazing.
But I'm not your slave.
In the early hours of the morning, Brian was sitting at his house reading.
Love is blind.
There's someone looking at you.
"You can kill someone.
The bag is very heavy.
Theblem?
take her home.
Why do you want me to help you?
We jumped.
How'd you do?
Someone's been calling the police.
I can't do that to you right now.
"Come into my room.
I can't tell you the truth.
I asked him to forgive me for what I did.
Karl Marx said: "Religion on the one hand comes from violence on the other hand from violence on the other hand from the struggle against violence on the other hand.
He doesn't seem to be patient.
I took this picture in Boston on the 20th of October.
You don't hear the kids.
Come along with me.
What's with the paella!
Let go of me!
He gave us a latte.
Who's going to ask for the patch?
How am I going to find it?
You've read?
It's been difficult already.
I don't have to do that.
Turn off the TV.
I've changed.
Do a little bit of work.
You've made my mind up!
I've been missing something.
I've read the books.
Who are they with?
Are you crazy?
She laughed at her.
Why do you want all this?
I've followed her.
"Did you eat?
Sam and Layla were friends.
Do you have a car?
They'll find them.
Tom was going to work.
It's snowy enough to make a big splash of water.
The people love freedom.
She doesn't have any friends.
This needs to be helpful.
Hey, who's talking?
Religion leads to war.
In the power of YOU!
The medicine will help you.
I like to eat burgers.
Swizzle.
Keep going.
It's a tree, too?
His wife got married in a shop.
Well, maybe not.

It's like you're from India.
"What time did you get here?
Who's going to remember?
He was walking with Mary.
It's expensive.
He knows how to play.
Call me when you come.
You're a fool.
He wanted to go home to Boston.
Accept it from your sister.
Don't say the story.
Tom died in Boston on October 20, 2013.
He said don't try.
Is there anything we can do?
My feet are so much smaller than yours.
I like to eat rice.
I'll leave now if I don't have a problem.
Bought it.
Mary was stunned.
Mst!
He wanted to see Mary.
That's a bright idea!
Give us a face, at least.
It's worth millions of dollars for them to eat.
You've got to take a rest.
She didn't want to do that to herself.
Kids can read this book as well.
You're too tall!
Tom likes to read books.
You can read this book.
I'm rooting for Tom.
Try it!
The flowers are waiting for.
I stayed at home.
Someone's been watching you.
Tom refuses to eat his lunch.
No one cares who you are.
I've said it all before.
Are you going to do this to me?
Don't you sing.
I need someone to talk to.
You're afraid?
Tom nodded to Tom.
One of them said, "I've seen a couple of birds, but I don't understand."
God created man in such a way that he could not die.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
I'll need to buy some more stuff I need.
Go for a warm up.
Get down!
I told them not to tell you.
I like the Catalan language.
Boston was good.
I slept like that in the middle of the night.
Say it again.

Just ask around you.
If you have time to read this book.
Don't stop playing!
Stay in the ring!
in your readings.
He now lives in Australia.
Someone could get me a copy of it.
He said he was still sleeping.
Take care of yourself!
I'd like to spend some time with Tom.
Do you know what you're doing?
I'm going to tell you the truth.
I don't drink coffee.
Sam was very impressed by this.
"Did you find your letters?"
He is reading a newspaper.
"Do you know my wife?"
Faster!
You were a child.
The name "Tunisia" comes from the Greek word "Tunisia."
He's trying to calm down.
I'm asking Tom.
I will die for you.
Stay out of it.
What's your philosophy?
Tom said a lot.
"Should I eat this cake?"
No one had come.
It's like everyone else is speaking French.
Answer to my questions.
She's squeezing the taffy.
I will be returning to Australia on October 20th.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Say a word.
Abbuh!
"Mary and I were always fighting.
Did you learn how to cook or anything else?
Somebody's got me.
Let's make a complaint.
Let's have two eggs, two cups of coffee, and three slices of cheese, please.
I don't think I hate him.
I grew up in Australia.
I want to build a family.
He ate a lot of food for Mary.
Mike smiled, though.
"Did you eat your food?
I do it because I want to.
Theblem.
Take me to there.
I need to close the door.
Tom is suffering from a heart attack.
and stay inside.
It reminds me of my country.
I'm looking forward to reading as many books as I can this year.
He wants to have two eggs.
He's Tom's father, right?
Who's the Other?
I hope no one has seen you here.
Tom is currently in Australia.
They're smiling.
Come on!
"I'll call you every morning."
Please, please, read this book.
Can you spell that out?
You're lying?
Oh, my brothers!
You can change it if you want.
Haven't you ever called them?
Surrender.
I'm trying to get Tom to do that.
"Wait for something!
I hope it didn't bother you.
My father didn't know what a blacksmith was.
Somebody's got to do that.
I was so excited to open the door!
No one has ever seen you come here.
- It's raining.
Who's written these books?
At least in the morning.
I've done it before, I've done it before, how can I do it again?
I'm not lying, you're not lying.
"Please say hello to your parents."
Where's your Key?
It looks very much like me.
She doesn't like this game.
Do you want to help in the kitchen?
You see yourself in the mirror.
NOTHING has changed.
Err-as.
He's got more money than Mary.
Can you take care of it?
Are you a Japanese?
Swimming at night is a good idea.
Stop apologizing for it.
What'd he say?
Don't let your dreams dream.
I'm not Tom and I are friends.
I hate it when we do that.
Tom became like a man in a mirror.
She didn't want to do what Mary did.
It's a good life.
Put yourself down.
France is my second country.
I can call it.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,

It would be better if you came with us.
Sam's girlfriend was very friendly with him.
I know all about them.

You ain't got a heart.
We'll be waiting for you here.
But I'm not your servant.
I'd like to go see a movie.
Open up your eyes.

Get rid of problems like this.
Iguja Tom.
He knew that Mary would do it.
You're on your own.
Can you put up with this?
Is there anyone who would like to read it?
Just take me home.
I've been bitten by a snake.
Do you know how to swim?
Please go on.
I'm going to ask you something.
It's easy French.
We know.
I want to be able to speak my language in French.
I met a writer.
You can buy a book and read it whenever you want, whenever you want.
You're scared?
Why do you think what I'm saying makes sense?
Who's answered?
Did you see it?
"Someone stole my watch."
Your son is a handsome young man.
Oh, I miss it.
Well, let's try something.
I hope no one has seen you do that.
Someone was sleeping in his bed.
You're not Japanese, though.
But I'm not your slave.
Leave me alone.
"I know you're a teacher.
It rained during the day.
He was asleep.
Tom nodded to Mary.
He liked her because she was with him.
"There will be no more death," said Titus.
I'd rather be Mary.
I'd like to see.
He knew that Mary was following him.
Can you put up a band?
It's all right in front of you.
Would I ask a question that doesn't make sense?
Can you let me see the list, please?
You talked to them, didn't you?
Somebody's got me in my head.
I'll give you my car.
"Shut up there!
Sam started to tell a story.
Tom is always on my mind.
You're making fun of?
There's some pride in you!
Maybe he's seen something.
Tom and Mary were drunk.
Don't be complaining!
Tom opened the door and told Mary that John was not at home.
Nothing's happened.
O'Reilly is just drinking.
Someone's got it wrong.
I'm learning Latin because it's my favorite language.
Somebody was listening.
Tom seems to be very happy.
Why'd you read that?
I'm drinking a glass of ros<0xC3><0xA9>.
What kind of games do you like?
"Can you read this?
He went to Boston last week.
I'm full on Mondays.
So you're stupid?
Are you a German?
I'll find a way.
I didn't eat pizza last night.
What time do you want to eat?
Move to the left.
Tom is in Boston, but Mary isn't.

It seems to be interesting.
Everybody's talking.

I've just received your letter.
I don't want to eat more.
The bag is very heavy.
I've got something to give you.
What are you going to drink?
Let's go again!

"I can kill you.
It's done well.
Urgan.
You're awake.
They want to be the people.
Stop 'em!
Have you read this book yet?
It's your slave, isn't it?
I'm going to talk about poems.
Do you see what I want to say?
It's the same as before.
Do you think I should do that?
We are on Tuesday.
Keep it young.
It's going to snow today.
It's a child in my mind.
Tom doesn't have the courage.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom needs someone to look at him.
She takes her medication every two hours.
I'm really happy to be back in Australia.
Sam knew who he was.
All she wants is pleasure.
What a beautiful city it is!
He doesn't always tell the truth.
Someone came into the room.
The snow has stopped.
"I miss you very much.
I've got to meet someone.
Tom and I were married.
Oh, stop the crying.
You're going to have to try and get it done early.
He likes the oranges.
Tom knows something's up.
Can you wait for a minute, please?
Can I take a picture with you?
This is YOU.
I've got a good answer?
The time is wasted.
Who said you didn't win?
So, what's Tom going to do tomorrow?
Tom and Mary were married in October.
You're laughing at me?
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
You really don't like Boston, do you?
It's like he wants to go with you.
Go back to another.
Go home, go home.

Go and show it.
"Shut up Tom.
Is there anything I don't like about Tom?
You're helping him?
He only spoke to them.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I don't understand the art.
Get away from me!
Work to find it.
Well, let's go.
Please help me, please.
Are you going to be crazy?
Did I die for you?
She speaks English very well.
Why didn't you call him and remind him of that?
Dreams with a twist!
This was Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
I bought a bottle of water.
She said she didn't like her job.
It's a bad life!
The store is closed on Mondays.
Tom has woken up very well.
Do you have any other questions to ask?
"You can call me tonight."
It's just the seniors.
It's better not to talk to him.
Get Tom.
We talked.
What's in the room?
Tom's seen something.
I'm fighting for you.
Everybody is dreaming.
"I can forgive you."
Can anyone tell me why I'm interested in this?
This is for you.
Cut out the conflagrations.
I found a place where I could be myself.
"I can kill you.
I've been asking for forgiveness.
It's snowing.
Just hit the ball.
She's always loved Mary.
The Spring has arrived.
No one will believe us.
Be nice to you.

Tom didn't want to talk to us.
Someone's been calling for you.
Your mother's eating.
"Get up, stand up, you little man, why are you so upset?"
Why don't you drink the water?
It's a great story, isn't it, Tom?
That day was TERRIBLE.
Ini-d "aah".
He passed by Mary.
Somebody's been stealing my money.
Take a look at it!
That's a lot of work, Tom!
You're talking fast.
I'm not used to working outside.
You have friends, don't you?
They're all joking.
I've been working since yesterday.
Finally, the guests left, and there was silence in the house.
"I can kill you.
We're going to go back and forth, and we're going to get our hands on it.
They come to me.
"Where does your grandmother live?"
He released his dogs.
Tell them that I'm here.
It's a giggle!
So you're a poet?
What you're saying?
I think you're swimming better than me.
He killed a man with his sword.
What's your friend's name?
I answered them.

Can you give me a copy of the book, please?
I want you.
There's no going back. There's no going back. There's no going back. There's no going back. There's no going back.
You're very smart!
You're sleeping a little?
I didn't feel hungry at all.
I've got it wrong?
Do you like to lose it?
Theblem?
Tom wants to answer the question.
It's going to rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I don't have you on this issue.
Do they make a fuss?
Who's been able to help?
Stay in touch!
Hello, my name is Tom. What's your name?
Do you wish to stay longer?
I'm planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom was feeling good about himself.
He didn't care who he was looking at.
You can rest as much as you want.
Go back to where you're going!
Now, change your clothes.
You've got to see this.
Stay where you are!
I can't read without books.
I don't like swimming in the ocean.
Are you listening to me now?
God, no one has ever seen us.
You're not sleeping much.
We are trying to help you.
You know he likes beer.
I'm glad you were there.
Where are you going to go today?
I think you look like Japan.
He left his keys at home.
You're going to stop Tom?
No one was a cat.
"Why did you choose Tom?"
"Open your mouth!
I'd like to try.
I'll show you how it's done.
My words are the truth of my life.
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
I don't need your pain.
He doesn't seem to eat much.
They were not in doubt.
You're all a mess.
He'd lost track of where he was going.
You're laughing.
You're all crazy.
"Your parents love me very much.
What's up with Kyoto?
Don't forget it here.
Is there anyone who's been sleeping?
Have you ever played with a friend of mine?
I don't know that you don't know how to do that.
He's the only one who needs to know that.
There's no one who can!
I've been missing Paris.
I wish I was in Spain.
I need to learn how to defend myself.

Have you ever had a bite to eat?
It wasn't long after he died.
What are you going to do in Halloween?
Let's keep it up!
"That's your slave, isn't it?"
"When did this begin?"
She's annoyed him.
Let me explain that to you.
I can't do it if I'm staying or not.
Mary knew exactly what she wanted.
Try to get a dog, cat, or cat.
"I know you're here, Mike.

I came here to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?

I've been drinking something for Mary.
I love you very much.
Would I ask a question that doesn't make sense?
Where's my computer?
I'm not your slave!
He can speak French, too.
Look at your sister's example.
You know I can't.
I've been wanting to talk to you again.
They live outside the city.
The food has arrived.

God is.
There's someone watching you.
Tom went to sleep.
How do I get to the train station?

Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Hey, who's this?
I'll buy it for you.
He brought his brother.
I'll be back tomorrow.
We've seen them.
You're hurt?
We've got to do something.
You're speaking German very well.
Talk to someone.
Please don't tell me if there is any change.
They're laughing.
Please, please, please apologize.
Who's been fooling?
She wrote to me from Australia.
Tom held out his hand as he opened the door.
How long are you going to go?
Why do you want to help me?
Well, I have another solution.
It's a JOB.
Who's speaking?
What's bothering you is hurting me too.
He wants more.
Tom lifted his head.
No, thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my BOOKS.
Tom turned around.
Somebody's been talking.
"Can't we talk about it in the morning?"
There's no need to smoke!
As-d!

We hated them all.
Hurry to home.
She's helping him.
Get ready to.
I hope no one saw you do that.

He bought it for Mary.

I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom speaks French.

Hey, listen to this!
We can do that now.
Get ready for it as soon as possible.
I need to eat now.
I'm not crying anything.
He gave me some books.
I'm so glad you lost.
It's going to be windy.
show them.
Someone's been watching you.
It's a pity you can't come.
Swingmet-as.
Tom charged Mary 300 bucks for it.
"I don't know who can swim, who can't swim."
Yesterday, they left.
He said he had never heard Mary sing.
But nothing's changed.
Let him live as he pleases.
Let's get your car, please.
I've done that.
Answer it if you can.
"How did you find Tom?"
He calls me every three days.
She didn't kiss Mary.
You try to use it.
Do we really need to go back?
Let's see the way.
I'm alone on another day.
He wanted to buy flowers for Mary.
He followed Mary into the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything has an opportunity.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why didn't you listen to me?
I bought a new car.
It's painful!
No one will understand me.
Shu Tom!
So, you're an artist?
You're asleep?
Yusa Tom.
Tom came out of his dream.
It didn't happen.
Go where no one knows you.
I don't like big dogs.
Is there anyone you want to know?
I don't have a computer every day.
Tom is able to get some food.
You're playing!
I want to be a writer.
"Shut it up!
He tried to take Mary away from him.
Tom is an arsonist.
It's better if you don't eat.
I'm the Kabylie.
Someone was at home.
I'm not a student.
He said he wanted to quit smoking.
There's someone who's calling now.
Tom didn't see him.
What Are You Waiting For?
I want someone to help me do this.
Tom was married to his wife.
The award is well-earned.
I love to watch western movies.
I can't see what it looks like.
"He'll come to you tomorrow.
Tom is good.
So you're in Australia?
I hope no one is following you.
Aren't you shy?
Who? Me?
Shum!
He's always speaking French to me.
I have a plan to write it.
I know a few of them.
Don't you want me to rest?
She didn't expect him to see her.
I'm not interested in you on this.
Smile, please.
I'm going to pay.
He was trying to swim across the pond.
you're laughing?
Go to your home.
He's got to be a good teacher!
"Why did they send you?
What do they say to you?
I need to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent it home.
i like it.
I heard someone talking.
I want you to shut the door when you leave.
Where's the Wagon?
There's someone staring at you.
You don't want to win, do you?
"Do you know Tom?"
How'd you do?
Why didn't you call him and remind him of that?
Somebody's been talking to him.
"Please tell him to come in.
everybody loves you.
Would you like me to ask you a question that isn't relevant?
As the saying goes, man comes from the dust.
Tom is not a good witness.
It doesn't stop me when I'm talking.
Tom asked for Mary's help.
Do something!.
The books I've been given have been a gift.
She went swimming in the river.
I think it would be good for you to read this book.
"Why are you afraid?
These are new.
Is there anyone who can help me?
There's someone watching us.
You'll be fine if you continue to work in a place like this.
Tom is not dead yet.
So we're going to climb a mountain.
Someone's been reading it to me.
Who's head is this?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a pair of shoes.
Tom was very excited.
Give me a different one.
Missed.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to London?
you're talking.
Scanned them?
I was walking with my dog.
I saw a guy who kissed me.
Maybe we should tell someone else.
Today's youngsters are very good.
Please don't be mad at me.
Someone's been calling you.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you've got any questions?
Scream!
Please take a seat on the beach.
Shut up!
What's this?
I would have understood.
Don't eat it.
What are you going to give your dog to eat?
Tom has until October 20 to rule on it.
I got fired from my job.
Bring me home.
You've got to see his movie.
You've all succeeded.
Go ahead.
He's the highest in his class.
How's everybody doing?
She's been flowering.
Maybe you've done that with us.
"Eat your food, John.
He doesn't always tell the truth.
All I'm saying is you're just trying to get my head up.
I'm leaving for Australia on Monday.
I wonder how anyone would want to get their hands on it.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
It's great if you continue to work in a place like this.
They stole my money.
I know you're very busy.
They slept.
"What can you give me, Tom?"
I remember doing that, too.
I was hoping he'd come.
No one can't swim.
I'm looking out for her.
Drink the water.
Is there anyone who can help?
Now, listen very carefully.
That's what I wrote, my son.
I'm wondering if he's got a gun or not.
She still wants to go out with you.
He said he didn't want to sing.
I like it very much.
"Thank you for leaving my house.
I decided I wanted to go back.
Get me back to work while I'm at it.
What do you think of his new book?
Maybe someone can stop me.
So you're Russian?
He said he had never eaten Thai food.
He said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher.
Do you know how to remember?
You're all crazy.
"When did you come to Tom?"
What do you put in the box?
He became very popular.
I called for security.
you're dancing.
Mary was injured.
"This house is small.
We're not asking for it now.
Get out of here!
Who came up with this idea?
I told him to eat a dog.
Let's have coffee.
I hope that you understand.
How'd you find me?
I thought it would solve the problem.
"Where are we going to go to Kathmandu?" he asked.
They use computers.
I have nothing to fear.
I'm not going to try to stop you.
I want to know what you've done.
"Did something happen?
I felt a thing.
"Do you have a dog?"
"Can you speak slowly, please?"
There's someone who wants to talk to you.
Hold on to it!
are you here?
Tom was lying.
Tom and Mary aren't currently in the UK.
I didn't know until I found out!
He said he wasn't alone.
Look at this water.
Thank you!
There's someone waiting for you.
I love the light of the girls.
Don't you like Italian?
"Did you find your letters?"
I don't love you anymore.
"I saw a dog.
What's the name of this fruit?
What's my prize?
I won't forget that.
I hope no one sees you here.
I'm sorry...
When did you start to do that?
I'm going to quit work.
Finished.
"I've got to learn French," he said.
She couldn't finish her dinner.
Get back on.
She told me that she wasn't thirsty.
He wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't do it anymore.
James is a good fit.
A cup of tea, please.
You're speaking French?
Please call me if there's anything that's changed.
Stay away from me!
"Have you seen Tom yet?"
They're going to play football tomorrow.
Wa John.
Oh, how strong you are!
Tom was crying.
Go Ahead!
There were two things that happened that didn't happen.
You don't like your dog, do you?
It's the next Monday after Sunday.
I'll be in Boston in October.
"Did you see the smile?
You'll remember me?
You are RIGHT.
You're speaking very fast.
You're hungry?
Is there anyone who's gone?
Come on over here.
He had been drinking until yesterday.
I've lost my job.
Tom likes the art.
There's someone watching.
"You never told me you knew Tom.
It's going to be on Monday after Sunday.
I'm not your servant!
Why wouldn't he want to stay?
What's your name on the sky?
Someone's breaking the law.
Uraret!
Go with your foot.
It's not that expensive to eat at this restaurant.
I'm almost alive.
I HATE to lose.
Shu-t.
You're sick.
You have to write a novel.
Those who want to fail.
I understand.
Who's gone with you?
They're getting to know each other.
Keep on this.
Help me to me.
You'd better get rid of your hair.
He bought a piece of cake for Mary.
We got a shot at the pool.
Make sure you know what you need to do.
I'm going to stay in London now.
He went home with Mary.
He's broken the boundaries of my heart.
You've been lying.
Mary and Joseph are back.
I'm wondering if you like me a lot or if I just love you.
It snowed all over the city.
Just give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where have you been?
The one who took my eyes off of me.
Anyone would like to send a message.
"Did you see his face?
I want you to take part.
Maybe you'll find someone.
You are friends.
I was ready for them.
You're wrong, Tom.
You can drive if you want.
They're Joking.
Read!
You've woken me up.
Someone has to do something.
I want to eat something.
He used to drink beer.
It smells like a bad smell.
"Did you eat anything last night?"
Don't leave your files here.
He needed someone to help him.
You're back.
He said he'd never eaten a chicken.
Somebody is singing.
He's coming?
Somebody's got to stop us.
They've got you.
I'm going to learn Spanish in my own country.
"Someone can see us.
I'm not going to miss Boston.
"Is it yours or mine?"
He didn't think that Mary liked him.
that's what you need.
Bring me my shoes.
Ease up!
Take these.
He just texted me.
Choose it quickly.
"You can go home now.
Come on behind me.
I forgot to eat my dog.
You're in the kitchen.
It's Terrified!
I live in Erevan.
There is NOTHING here.
I know you're going to find something to do.
Tom is able to swim.
Don't be afraid to play.
They agreed.
"Stop the crying!"
Somebody's watching Tom.
Get your clothes on!
She's eating my hand.
Do you want to go swimming in the winter?
I'll never forget Mary.
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
you're lying.
They've hit.
I miss her, Mary.
Muten
You can read this book.
I asked him to come with me and he agreed.
Scared?
I let him kiss me.
Let the water run.
Are you a U.S. citizen?
You don't know what true love is.
They're making fun of you.
Go for something.
Stand up for yourself!
Tom is playing guitar.
It's also a good thing to be scared, and it's scary.
Someone was listening to it.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Get away from you!
Who are these windows?
"If someone could catch us?"
That's all it is.
you're lying?
Tom is thinking.
The school is growing in understanding.
You might have to stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
She said she was afraid of Mary.
You've found us.
Do you think it will be a good experience?
Help me help.
There's nothing that can't be done?
He's not as good as his brother.
Look at their backs.
Open the file with this key.
I did not leave her alone.
What's a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
It's popular?
Do you know Mary before you go to the party?
Speak up for yourself!
Someone's broken the chain.
No one had gone there.
Tom and I are just friends.
You're lying to me?
The book can't read itself.
Please teach me how to write in French.
I told him I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
It's French?
You have.
Oh, how beautiful it is!
Would you like to get some food?
I really do love you.
Don't let you fly.
Try to remove it.
One for you, and one for me.
"He talked to me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
That's the Story.
Tom was pissed off.
"How much time?
Somebody's singing.
Open your mouth.
How did you spend your time in New York?
Where'd you leave them?

"Do you need food?
Make yourself at home.

I made a big mistake.
He was sitting next to Mary.
Tell me the story of the girls.
He speaks 10 languages.

He built a big house.
He thought he was better than all of them.
I'm always proud of you.
"I can't speak another language.
He's never had a problem with anyone.
Hello, everybody.
He didn't know it was Mary.
He is a man of many dreams.
Tom was furious.
It's just evaporating.
So why don't you listen to it?
All of the students in the class commented on Tom's new teaching.
He didn't know how to walk with people.
Call me when you arrive.
Why don't you ask someone else to do that?
I have lots of food.
It's bringing snow.
Tom has changed.
I saw Tom's face.
You still don't understand.
Hey, look at you!
He's coming soon.
The Holidays.
Your baby is small.
How did you get through the weekend?
Have another one.
I met Mary at a Halloween party.
Stand up for yourself!
I'd like to see your sister.
He bought it for Mary.
He died on October 20, 2013.

Can you give me a little bit of money?
You're a good writer.
Dilmuns.
She sings to Julia.
That's a trip!
Is there somebody there?
Sam was stationed in a small town.
He didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone's seen you.

you love me!
Get back on!
Those who don't grow, don't grow.
"Mr. Sakaki has come to see you.
Tom then began to read.

Can you come out?
I will do my best for you.

He said he wanted to make money.
Let's stop now.
He told me I was beautiful.

Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
Please respond to it.

I'm so glad to have met you here.
Tom doesn't go to Boston until October.
You've already signed up?
Are you crazy?
I told him he had to do it.
"Can I say something?
We may need them.
So, who is the truth?
Somebody's been talking.
Are you going to make a meal?
What the hell are you looking at?
Is there anyone who can help me?
I gave him some of the money I had.
Listen to me!
There's someone waiting for you.
A cow is a cow of the poor.
Don't you like Italian?
It would be nice to see you again.
Walk.

There's another one, as the first one said.
The house was on fire.
I told him why I wasn't there.
He looked at Mary.
Today is the second day in October.
He said he could help us do that.
So, who likes them?
"When did you come to Boston?"
Did you tell me why you didn't come to the party?
I've come alone.
Did you ever tell me why you didn't come to the party?
they're new?
You are my only hope.
Don't you move!
Don't take care of yourself.
She said she wasn't too upset.
They made the French bread.
I've never needed that kind of money.
They waited.
You need to talk to Tom.
He went back to the park and looked around.
He called to say he wasn't coming.
I need to speak with someone.
You're joking?

How'd you go to Australia?
Who and what did you watch the movie with?
Tom and I were on the same train.
I love my kayak.
There's someone there?
Can you speak French as well?
You're being judgmental.
Tom is a good writer.
He plays the piano all the time.
You don't need to go to school today.
It's because you're a girl.
There's someone here already.
Sicily is an island.

What's the price?
No one's ever heard it.
"Who shouted?
Tom nodded to Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom is dancing.
He promised to come as soon as possible.
Oh, you idiots!
I got a lot of hours.
It's going to be over.
Good luck to you!
"Stay here until you get here."
Tom is very good.
Please don't leave me here with you.
You don't know who we're meeting.
Do you remember what he said?
"Show me your papers."
"How long have you been in Boston?"
There's someone outside.
I don't really like Boston.
My doctor is very good.
I asked him why he went to the hospital.
Go and show it.
I love the girls.
Somebody's watching.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Naomi turned her head from one side to the other.
You're approaching.
I am your brother's friend.
She didn't want to help Mary.
Why did you come to me?
Hello to all of you.
I'm not different.
That's your book?
We are HAPPY.
Liesen.
Tom is silent.
You still have bread. Do you want anything?
Where I live, where you live.
The class will be held on October 20th.
Trees bloom in the spring.
There's someone with an umbrella.

I'm looking forward to the whole movie with you.
You've heard that, haven't you?
Don't make fun of me.
"Did something change?
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
Is it possible to change the world?
Tom was exhausted.
Tom took up his position.
They took off and went to the market.
I'll never forget the day I met you.
- I play the piano.

Please read it again, please.
He offered drinks to everyone at the bar.
Hello, my beautiful.
Please come in, please.

Why do you make no sense to me with these words?
Red is better.
You can get your money back if you want.
You've got a lot of courage.
Don't split into two groups.
When I moved to New York, I was about 30 years old.
There's someone waiting for you.

What do you think is missing?
Someone may have been hurt by it.

"We need somebody.
You're lying, I'm not.
It's very expensive the book.

He is expected to return in October.
Mary was saved by Tom.
He needs someone to help him.
"Did you see the Queen?"
This isn't Tom's book.
I don't know who you want to know.
Follow your Dreams.
He spoke to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
"Someone stole my food."
Let go of me!
Everyone agreed to it.
Harden up!
I just want to buy my new car.
It's still hot though.
My son went to Japan.
"Did you ever speak French?"
"You're going to give that to Tom?"
They're always making fun of others.
"Where is your God now?"
When he started to go crazy.
Tom likes to read.
Home!
He yelled at Mary.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia yet.
He learned from his sister.
God is aware of it.
We talked.
Tom, are you?
No one understands you.
Tom likes to sing.
I'm hoping someone will do that now.
Maybe he'll be able to help you out on Monday.
The dog is asleep.
You've got to get used to it.
All my friends have one.
In any case, the virus that caused the Covid19 virus, because we didn't build it, has passed our awareness.

He may have seen something.
Who's running?
Tom seems very frightened.
He lied to Tom.
"Where were you this morning?"
Did you come to see it?
Lydia, can you make a dish for Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
He killed someone.
I'm not lying, you are.
Do you sleep a little?
I'm loving the art.
But I'm not your love.
Be a good one!
I'm going to tell you some German friends.
Take your interest in their approach.
I'm very happy with your idea.
All of them speak French.
"You know yourself!
It's my little garden.
He woke them up.
That ain't much.
You're on Tom's side.
Don't matter to him.
Peter's got a cat.
What is it that you say?
Have you come back from China?

Is there anyone waiting for it?
Somebody's watching.

He started working on October 20th.
We've been waiting for them.

I guess I'll start with a beer.
Tom knew that Mary had gone to Boston.
Get your clothes on!
There was nothing in his place.
The cabin is empty.
He'll come tomorrow.
James is jealous of me.
I don't think he speaks French all the time.
Take care of yourself.
Get up early and find your place.
What did you wear?
Somebody's already done that.
Do it now.
"Did you eat lunch?
"Do you remember what Tom said?"

Somebody's got to do something.
You've finished your job?
Can you give us a minute, please?
Teskerkes.
It's full of problems.
I'm not a leftist, I'm not a rightist, I'm a leftist.
She already knows the answer.
Why don't you like it? why don't you?
Who's got you?
Where are we going to go? What do you think?
Where is your son's son?
I'm going to follow Mary.
Ah, then!
Try to find a cure.
Let go of me!
He's already on the bus.
You don't seem to care.
"Can I go home now?"
He nodded his head to Tom.
When do you want to come to Zadar?
When I heard him speak, he didn't speak to his brother.
You're lying.
No one will ever believe me again.
It's a good thing that you can't do in one language, but it's not in another language.
Is there anyone who has been hurt?
The snow has fallen.
I like to eat outside.
"Someone stole my passport."
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Who is the author of this book?
English is a beautiful language that brings out music with a human face.
This is Tom's car.
I think a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
It's going to get very crowded again.
<0xE3><0x80><0x8C>Why would you think that?
Tom and Mary went to the Devil's Tower.
Tom shrugged.
He may be coming.
How do you like a girl who doesn't know?
You got water from the water.
Can you see I'm pretty?
"Someone stole my food."
Sam sat in a chair.
Tom and I were separated.
You've got courage!
I wish I was alone.
I'm not going to wash your car.
She had always been beautiful to him.
You can change it if you want to.
Don't you lie to me.
Jesus was a prophet, wasn't he?
Who's in there?
You've become a fool?
Tom's response was too late.
He left all of it.
Water, please.
I need someone to talk to.
He was able to talk to the people.
I was just joking with him.
I don't like to play baseball.
I'm leaving work in October.
They've got a lot of money.
Tell it to everyone.
Do You Have a Problem?
Tom is dying.
I saw him in Boston on October 20th.
Tom is a good man.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Hey young man.
I love the games with you.
I felt like I was being fooled.
She LOVES her.
I'm sure your father will be proud of you.
"Someone told him the truth."
"I can teach you how to cook.
Where did you find it difficult to eat?
I'd have to do it again for someone else.
Tom is a good friend of mine.
It was snowing.
Mary was very pleased with it.
Alice was asleep in her room.
He called Tom.
Take care!
What's good about this dress?
Smile.
It's you.
Is there anyone out there?
Tom nodded to Mary.
Call on her, please.
Sam and I were fighting every day.
Do you want to read something?
I opened the door for her.
Is there anyone you want to read?
He was wearing a Halloween costume.
I hate it when it comes out.
I need to learn how to defend myself.
We all know how to speak French.
He plays the guitar very well.
Do you want to talk to your wife in Spanish?
He married his sister.
There's someone following us.
There's always somebody there.
Did you plan to get it?
I'll leave you a few messages.
Who is the owner of this car?
I may not be able to do it today tomorrow.
But you can't drive.
"Someone's been sleeping here."
You've already paid.
Australia is one of the only countries I've seen in the past year.
That's really amazing.
Tom's got something for you.
Is there anything you want?
"Show me your papers."
Now, go and change your clothes.
It's already October.
Oh, what idiots!
We are Brothers.
Be nice to people.
"Who can open the door, please?"
I live in Azerbaijan.
What did you do today?
You're crazy are you?
I'm mad for you.
He calls me every three days.
This book is so heavy.
Do you think I'm pretty?
You're dead?
He said we'd have to wait here.
leave it to us.
I'm sorry they didn't try it.
I'm very happy with your idea.
He went to Mary.
Choose one of them.
It's your time !
she's talking.
So you're a musician?
"Don't worry, I don't want to see you!"
She helped Tom.
No one can help you!
There are some plants that are very cold.
I've been singing all day.
I spent the day at the beach.
you can have what you want.
You came!
Listen to your teachers.
Tom is a respected man.
For each one will carry his own burden.
I know Tom's secret.
Are you annoyed?
Art is dead.
You're not Tom's friend?
He SMILE.
This for you.
Are You a Man?
You're happy about that?
I called for help.
"You like to dance.
She believes in Mary.
It's clean.
It's a sign of someone who's sick or who's sick or who's sleeping or who's sleeping.
That's what I think.
You'd be surprised what Tom drinks when he goes out.
Is there anyone waiting for you?
You're angry?
Please don't forget about this issue.
I think he's busy this morning.
Follow me on.
Take it easy, Tom, you're good.
I'd like to try this.
There was someone who stole from me.
Are you trying to eat it all?
He died on October 20, 2013.
Sammy nodded as well.
Look closely!
Are you going to swim?
"Someone stole my food."
Forget it.
Are you going to sell your house?
I LOVE the games.
"I don't want to tell Tom what happened."
Look into the truth.
He was travelling to Australia.
Mary's response surprised me.
you know the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I won't do that either.
He was jealous of Mary.
It's a bad thing?
He's going to kill me.
No one has sent me a letter.
I've got an idea for it.
I can't look after you.
Have you achieved it yet?
Who's gone with you?
He wants to make a lot of money quickly.
Something hasn't changed.
"I need to meet Tom.
hold on to something.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
That's paper?
I'm at home.
You can also go home now.
"Where are your sisters?
I didn't really do what he said I should do.
Today, it's a blast!
Each one will pay for himself.
Get used to reading it.
Someone's going to pay for it.
Keep writing.
I don't need your cock.
"They've already eaten?"
He's crying.
"Why do you need a sword?"
He currently lives in Australia.
I'm a maid.
It's windy.
Tom and Mary are still smiling.
Igen Tom.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
Where I live, where you live.
Tom was stunned.
Are you allowed to travel in Australia?
Somebody is paying for it.
She forgot how beautiful it was.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He was on the way in a hurry.
Tired.
He likes to fish.
There's someone in Tom's room.
I can't grow up.
We've both been tired.
The Spring has arrived.
is there anyone you want to see?
Tom took the keys to Mary's car because she was drunk.
But you can't eat here.
You've got a car!
Sam and Layla have been together for years.
The two kissed him.
Agreed.
Your idea is bigger than that.
Stop!
I HATE computers.
She gave him a cup of coffee for Mary.
It was their idea.
I'm complaining about Sofia.
You're finished?
She'd stopped it.
Where's the tower?
HELP us.
Sam didn't see me at all.
We've got a plan.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Where did you learn French?"
He was sitting reading a book.
Somebody's been eating.
"Can you give me Tom for a minute?"
Layla was a naughty boy.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Don't complain about it!
He couldn't solve the problem on his own.
Sam didn't know who she was.
"How many books do you have?"
You're a fool.
- Nothing happened.
Expired.
You keep reading it.
He went to Spain.
We've been asking for 40 years.
- Where's your son?
Tom complained to me.
They didn't say anything.
Somebody's got a problem.
Be quiet, please.
You'd have to eat something.
He's hungry, and he's hungry.
I've read books.
Forget Tom!
You're a lot older than Tom.
I ate it.
Come on home.
I asked Alex.
I like to swim.
Hold on to me!
I won't repeat your mistakes.
Tom and Mary were traveling.
"How much can you pay for that?"
"Why are you afraid?
You're ready to fly.
Tom had never had a child with Mary.
"Come into my room.
I've got to do that now.
Let the water run.
We are in the Spring.
The contract expires on October 20.
Did you check it out?
"Dad, give us a break!
HELP us.
I'm surprised to see you.
You keep moving.
Do you have a list of Australians?
I don't think Tom did it.
Tom was blown away by the wind.
He's old.
I left Australia on March 20th.
"Did you eat your food?
I see what you're reading.
He was afraid of his father.
Let me outta here!
Hi, I'm from Nancy.
I ran away.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'm going to get dressed tomorrow.
They didn't even know Tom's name.
Fernet!
I don't want to go to Boston in October.
Sam didn't want to stop.
You're scared.
YOU are a problem.
James was in a state of jealousy.
Is there anyone who has seen anything?
There's someone calling for you.
I need someone to help me.
Just be patient, it will be over soon.
You're a Chinese?
The two met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sings a love song in Kabylie.
"Did you put it all in there?"
Someone has to do that.
Latin is a dead language.
He's the only one who should know that.
Welcome to you.
How do you feel to yourself?
You look like you're sick.
Of course I will do that.
Tom and Mary seemed to be good friends.
It'll never.
You'd like to talk to me, wouldn't you?
I've got the money.
I love her and she loves me.
Laila finally came to the party.
Love will make you blind.
You've been very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom has been robbed.
The black cat is eating a white male.
- I'll go.
"Get your clothes on!
Somebody's getting tired.
She bought a bottle of water.
Saulent.
Let's ask for something else.
Do you understand?
What's your favorite team?
Take your sister's example as an example.
He came close to my house.
But you still don't understand.
Dinner!
I asked him to leave immediately.
She couldn't get to Mary.
Can you show me a picture, please?
Sam left his family there to take care of his family.
You're lying to me?
It's the Japanese?
Is there anything you've seen?
I'm going to need you here tomorrow.
I'm waiting for Mary.
He seemed to be sad.
Tom gave up his life.
God is.
Tom has returned from Australia.
Ttu Tom.
We were talking about Australia.
He said he couldn't eat any more.
He ain't a boy.
Someone's already done that.
I don't want to live with you.
Yes, I speak some French.
He told her that he was thirsty.
I've been to a lot of countries in Asia.
My hair is small.
I'll die for you.
Your work is done with just one click.
Wet Tom.
Your job is only for one person.
S Uber.
These books aren't for me.
I'd like to eat with you.
Get some rest.
Give it to whomever you want.
"Can you keep an eye on Tom?"
"What did your mother say?"
Tom's wife is a Canadian.
I'm going to eat bananas.
You weren't laughing.
Tom wants to marry me.
I don't sleep until the sun comes up.
He thought that one day he'd be able to get rid of it.
She knows how to live.
I was very excited in October.
"Can you help me, please?
"Shut up, please.
He was a very difficult man.
The teacher was on my desk.
I'd like this book, please.
I love the stories of laughter.
I am a human.
It's our turn!
Could this have happened in the UK?
Call on Tom.
It's only been three months now.
you're happy.
It's a fact.
Don't mess with me, Tom.
I'm not the one who cheats.
I was in your marriage.
What's in it for someone to see?
Anyone looking for it will find it.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sam knows his stuff.
Just let me see it.
"I don't know why I'm laughing.
It looks good.
I'm not your servant!
You're drinking a lot?
Somebody has come.
One of the things that makes sense is that it's a bad thing.
"You're still in school?"
You are a person of anxiety.
Someone was trying to warn you.
Let's talk about this in the third paragraph.
Jack is my name.
Help us, please.
Tom couldn't get away.
He wants to make a lot of money quickly.
The roads are broken.
It's better to tell her.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!

There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics.
Please, please, please, please!
I want to know what you've done.
I'm going to help you grow a beard.
"Did you see your table?"
He said he was going to leave tomorrow.
I'm worried about your success.
We'll see you in October.
I found out I had a brother.
I don't have to go to this place to get away.
Put yourself down.
I'd forgotten your number.
you're sleeping?
I'm starting a new life.
I've been thinking about you before.
I like to eat pizza.
Those who can climb the mountains can climb the hills.
He was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We've just finished eating.
Are you worried?
Don't you go!
"Be yourself.
Somebody's sleeping in here.
You'll be able to understand Tom.
We've only done it once.
Yes, I know French.
you've got a fever.
You're happy about that?
You don't have to be afraid of that.
There's someone calling for you.
I'd like to surprise everyone.
"Did you get the picture, Tom?"
Pick up your book.
See you later, Mom.
He said he had a day off.
Oh, what a problem!
You're a good student.
Someone's broken the door.
I've been wanting to talk to you as well.
I won't be alone.
Search for someone else.
Tom began to laugh.
What's a writer you like?
"I know Tom.
"Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to say it?
Who's head is this?
I'm going to try and help you.
No one's listening.
I'd like to learn astrology.
So, please do my best to help you. I am pleading with you.
No one paid attention.
"Who am I speaking with?
I'm going to like Tom.
Oh, my brothers!
I need a new dress.
He likes to make good choices.
This is coming from Australia.
Tom had to stop smoking.
Somebody's got to stop it.
Get together.
What kind of girl do you like?
It's Your Day!
You're trying to kill Tom.
Why didn't you bring it home?
It's blown up.
Did you give it to him for his birthday?
Construction should start in October.
At times, he hesitated.
Do you know how to spell?
You're sick?
Listen!
Don't speak!
It's like I see you.
None.
Have you ever had a crush on someone?
The day is running out.
Do you have a rock?
He LOVES himself.
I asked her why she didn't do it again.
Tom paid for it.
He's been going to Mary's for a while.
"How much did you eat bread?"
The boy is clean.
French is hard to find.
I think there was someone in the room.
It's finally snowing.
He refused to believe her.
Who's head is this?
You're on the edge of a cliff.
I'm very happy for you.
"I need the truth.
"This house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Make the best use of your vacations.
Tom is very nice.
Somebody was looking at it.
Sell it.
It might be true.
Every question has an answer.
I'll show you how to do it if you ask.
Stop this shit!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
He ran outside to see what was going on.
I saw a guy who kissed me.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you, too.
You've got to watch their behavior.
There's someone here or there.
You're here all alone?
Keep your eyes up.
"Who said that?
It's good for you.
We have used what we have.
I don't want to buy them anything to drink.
I haven't said anything yet.
It's my job to teach English.
Tell them that I'm here.
I think he ate his food.
I need someone to help me.
I was afraid to tell the truth.
Layla heard the noise outside.
When I was a kid, I used to love Sam.
Do you and your wife know French?
you're at home?
Where did you come from?
Someone's waiting for you.
They'll do what I told them to do.
"I don't want to stay with Tom."
"Who said that?
Is that the right one?
you're alone.
My wife has a lot of work.
I don't need to say anything.
No need to smoke.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Don't say anything.
But that's not Tom.
Why don't we go back home?
I want someone to talk to.
I didn't do anything.
Sam watched the video.
I've been going to the right.
Remember the last year.

Now let's dance.
Somebody's got to do it.
Have a better time and a better life!
You can have anything you want.
Take good care of yourself!
I love you very much.
He's working for Mary.
That's a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom's confident about that.

No one knows who killed him.
Ask!
Don't forget the English.
Tom's been collecting old stuff.
No one listened to it.
I'll take some.
You've already paid.
You've missed Tom.
Look at yourself.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.
Mine is bigger than you.
That's a nice car!
I know you're a writer.
Eat what you want.
What kind of game would you like to play?
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
She was afraid of Mary.
"Can I ask you who you are?"
Forget about me.
The teachers had to explain everything in a simple way, not just to tell the students to go and read their books at home.
Tom doesn't drive his car today.
Who's the last one?
Theggam?
Are you the people?
What we don't have is waiting for us.
Are you going to be crazy?
The majority of Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
That's all it is now.
Who's car is it?
We jumped there.
Is there anyone who's called the police?
We need to talk to Tom.
Do you want to watch TV every day?
We're looking forward to this evening.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to say to Tom.
If we don't, we can if we don't want to.
I could ask you to come with me.
"Anyone who did something wrong," he said.
Tom was drinking.
Action!
The truth of you?
You're drunk?
In 1962, the OAS's President, Mullah Mouloud Firaun, said: "But we have become another country and we have seen what is happening to us."
I need someone to help me.
He's going to learn French.
I think it's a pretty place.
Come on over here.
I think he and Mary are tired.
We didn't get along with Tom.
"How much time?
Because he didn't need that.
It's the path that leads us to the path that leads us to the path that leads to the path.
I hope you're scared of him.
She didn't help her father.
I was in a hurry home.
Religion is more important than the religion of God.
I didn't hear anything.
Don't you go!
I don't eat fish.
I'm eating and drinking.
I thought you'd know Tom.
Show that.
Leave everything.
I ain't a girl.
"Do you like dogs?"
"Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I would like to work with them.
Because he didn't like it.
She tried to touch my face.
She's going to be a good daughter to Mary.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who's coming with us.
Somebody's got to stop you.
You're looking for Mary.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.
Who's your brother?
"Are you here alone?
I've known Layla for many years.
See you back again.
I'm bigger than you.
"You can kill someone.
It's a beautiful light.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
I couldn't believe he kissed me.
I spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat eggs.
We've tried.
your day has come!
Why?
There's no idea there.
Have you read the first book in the series, "The End of the World"?
Oh, what a fool!
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,

How do I get rid of the errors in the script?
"Why did you stay alone?

Your father has a plan.
"You need a good woman.
There's something missing.
Please give me the car, please.
Some of the stars appeared in the night sky.
Add another cookie.
What are you going to eat for lunch?
What's going on in Boston?
I know I'm from Australia.
Tell it tomorrow.
He refused to go to sleep.
Why don't you do all that?
Tom's going to leave.
He gave it to Mary.
They've made mistakes.
Somebody's got to do something.
Cancel!
Just talk to them.
I'd like to see your sister.
What do they need to know?
Now I'm learning English.
We'll do that again.
I didn't speak French when I was there.
You're crazy if you keep working in a place like this.
What do you want to do?
Thank you, that's all there is to it.

What did your parents say?
Open up your eyes.
I'm an arsonist.
Do you understand?
You've got me mad!
He knows how to play with words.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
"Close your window.
He's coming tonight.
Tom seems to be tired.
Write to me now, don't you?
Deceived him!
"You're Japanese?"
I'm close.
Oh, how I miss you!
I'm loving her.
Tom is a fool.
Can you do any more of that?
He took his daughter to school.
Disruptive!
They've tried.
"Please please please.
Let's start singing.
He was born on October 20th.
Just tell me what I have to do.
This one's for you.
He said that it was Tom who did it.
You're quiet?
"Show yourself!
We both love each other.
I want her to be happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom nodded off.
He drove his car to the side of the road and back.
He can speak.
"You're all ready.
"Why do you want to leave?
It would be better if we didn't do it.
Tom was in Boston on October 20.
"Are you going to come with me tonight?
They treated him like a criminal.
He told me a lot of things.
There's someone outside.
You've got a book.
When are you going to leave?
Are you worried about something?
Scanned them?
Each sentence has a number of sentences.
What time do you want to eat?
Somebody's been killing Tom.
I think he's doubtful.
You've finished learning.
You're shutting down the room.
Please put it back, please.
"You think I should do that, don't you?"

There's someone waiting for you.
Mary agrees.
The huskies pass.
They're gone.
Spanish is my mother tongue.
No one is listening to it.
My feet are empty.
He called out to Mary.
Our son is a fool.
I'm going next week.
I've heard something.
Tom is very good.
He said we have to be patient.
Shut up Tom!
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
There's nothing about it!
I know he's very nice.
"Someone's been eating us.
I'm calling my car.
How much money do teachers have to pay?
What do you say?
Tom began to speak.
I'm sure I'd walk.
The girls like to talk.
I'll take you on your list.
I don't think he would want to be like us.
Will somebody tell me what's going on here?
I haven't kissed you yet.
There's no joke.
But I'm Russian.
Is there anyone you want to know?
I'll send someone.
Did somebody tell you about it?
There's someone waiting for you.
Tom is not good.
I haven't been home since October.

Is there anything that's bothering you?
I've been waiting a long time.

I did when I was young.
Tom is correct.
Thank you, Sherlock.
Someone's taken off their umbrella.
No one's listening.
I'll talk to you on October 20th.
Can't you eat with us?
Are you crazy?
He got into Layla's car.
I told him I'd never go to the store with him again.
Oh, is it true?
Do you want to go to the bar?
He spoke to the crowd.
I will arrive on October 20th.
How many books do you want to read?
You are in Boston.
Tom has been talking a lot.
Can anyone tell me why I'm interested in this?
Do you remember when you did that?
Tom is dying.
Welcome to you.
You seem to be quite right.
He found himself.
They stopped.
I'm going to call Tom now.
He needs someone to help him.
Do you have this kind of relationship with your partner?
"How much did you eat?"
Good.
Tom's going to stay.
Mary and Joseph explained why they were there.
I'm from Australia.
I was told a few days ago.
I wish I was in New York next year.
He wanted to see Mary.
You're really good!
The last time I thought about it, I thought it was crazy.
