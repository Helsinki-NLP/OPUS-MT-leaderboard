AMs from Wales fear to "be seen as a fool"
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this will make them look ridiculous .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language twp means ibleh and pwp means raw.
Plaid's AM said that the whole group 'wasn't happy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this conest the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called the Assembly Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government act empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AMs title, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on the legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of settling a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing as churches in Harlem are sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialize in a different way" today.
"Bars are no longer the center of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders are thinking, "and sooner or later they will return to where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the locality's sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building would be white carnations," he said, "and thus, they will not get upset when the day comes that they are created for these churches because it is likely that many of these people who enter to live in these condoms will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white caravans before Harlem became a metropolis of white caravans - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white carnage people left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people who were practicing religion nearby took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of black carnation people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who ran a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which resisted hiring to or promoting black carnation people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have had a black carnation musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked for the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not changed with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "seek to pass on the expenses" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors they sent from the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy during a lobster dive in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was shouting, 'Gidimni!
Gidimni!'
"It's been a long time since we've seen and heard the whole thing," Hamel said, realizing the moment the boy arrived.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelving corridors similar to those of a ‘department store' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of substantial revenues in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and articles for domestic use decline, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested at 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread to more successful outlets.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, Lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said that stores will increasingly look like ‘department stores' as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and a non-food product.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos' stores into hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight over how to split revenue from pharmacy stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, he said, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to be suitable for every need and the environment that attracts you and the convenient shop positions mean that we have become a destination for beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is 'very upset' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den Peter Jones' personality is 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home products and accessories firm, Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
This Morning's presenter, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left "Dragons' personality Den Peter Jones very angry because he cancelled out being part of their last-minute lucrative lifestyle firm business - to focus on her big contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that they didn't give her enough time to access it.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private lodgers.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely astonished.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch had almost come.
There is a stuffed warehouse produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is among Britain's lucrative personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her cousins Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador of M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said "We do not comment on his economic affairs."
It's hard to find love, but then we find love."
He joked about criticism that he will earn from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is it so hard for President Trump?
Trump said in a voice that mimics that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give anything away."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a big step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea would not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, note, the United States is continuing with targeted sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his manifesto speech.
He said, "We are doing well with North Korea".
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had been left behind at home.
And he defended his unusual approach while speaking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this arena full of people, we would have had about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroying Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move out of their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, thus challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on site.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief force.
Considering the earthquakes that frequently occur in Indonesia, the country is not yet well prepared for the great wrath of nature.
While a shelter from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, you hardly see them along the coast.
The apparent failure of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok for the care of the victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the center of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr. Joko's administration has sent because of the lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the street, using machetes, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool equalised in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a 'goal' in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the stick.
The ball bounces up most of the box as it ends up coming into the top right hand side of the net.
Eventually, the ball lands behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumps to try to welcome him, and falls into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him as far ahead as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think about it much and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 until the middle of the game after they got a ‘goal' in the 25th minute from the very good Belgian Eden Hazard.
The striker of Chelsea crossed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving to run to the half of the pitch and then quickly entered Liverpool's half.
Kovacic passes the ball on foot in the middle of the field.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, leading Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran over the players in defence and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed from Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, said a spokesperson from the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was full of debris from the collapsed building.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 this morning with injuries from a knife at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to speak.
Investigative Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam videos to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he found out what had happened.
Residents are being informed now that they have hours left until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is being considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene with tears in her eyes.
She keeps repeating "it's a horrible thing."
At 2 in the afternoon there were two police vans inside the closed area and another van just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the closed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last monument affected by the 'rewriting of history' argument
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate to the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artifacts performed by its fanatic 'Puritan' followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The 'iconoclasm' of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell's Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of a figure's historiography that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the middle conflict of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A Chinese man attacked and killed a Chinese farmer.
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut, blood-covered artery near a shack at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Reportedly, he traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he discovered a door to the nearby open pig pen.
He said that there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Cousin feet were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack anyone else, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the man ended up critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a Welsh farmer with his tractor until he cut off his wife's animal.
After pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked and ate it in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They bite, they are very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southeast of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rain throughout northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought in an 85 mph wind, a Category 1 Hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a 'trough' over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push strong tropical moisture towards the northU.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching ‘trough' will create heavy rain spreading in the southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and possible avalanches in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in southwestern parts, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the diffuse character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the ‘canyons' to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local blowing winds and dust.
The 'trough' will bring some rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the region of their rainy season.
Some floodplains of scattered tropical rain begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains become more widespread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads into Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some severe temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a large example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could climb up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be roughly 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with Friday's shocking last-minute news: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it's an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day sitting, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the protesters were caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were shouting with him as he tried to climb into the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the doors of the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate outright for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which Democratic minorities have long been urging.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of politics and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely contained."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office he released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death is damage by a gun from head to neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police's task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens to assist with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "diligence and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre-long striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan throws ash at Mexico City
Ashes being disposed of by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various tectonic sounds and shifts.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The famous volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
A pro-separatist group with their faces covered by anti-riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating a cloud of dark dust on the roads usually filled with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and the police had to use the funnels to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were chanting "Don't forget, don't apologize" and fighting unionist protesters shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received at the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region, which wants independence a year after an October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose by a large margin to become independent, although turnout was low with those who are against secession making a big boycott against the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he had not given up hope in the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with the joy they could vote for, but now we're alone," he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the subsequent regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are sending out to maintain this year's momentum with many of their best-known leaders either in exile who have ruled themselves or in detention and are awaiting trial because of their role in the uprising.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians of both sides.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before trial since the end of last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"By coming out as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: A man was arrested after a car rammed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry more than once.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A ‘crossbow' could also have been used to shoot towards the car at some point.
Menga's goal wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston wins game
Livingston, who was promoted, flattered Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for only the second time in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox 'club'.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not won a single off their home ground in the Premiership this season and next Sunday will play against Hearts, who are in first place and behind them with eight points.
Before that match, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna on their pitch in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue to have no defeat in the division in six matches, with head coach Holt not yet losing a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston miss opportunities against bulky visitors
Holt's team should have been winning before he had a 'goal', with his direct style of play causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the bar, then Alan Lithgow was only able to pass the ball with a wide heel after sliding down to reach receiving the ball from the headshot from Craig Halkett near the bar.
Those who were playing on their own pitch were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that it was the visitors they could give them problems at certain moments.
And that was how the crucial 'goal' came about.
Rangers allowed a ‘free-kick' to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and brought it into the club from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but they were finding the team's defense that they were playing on their own pitch, not penetrating, and the 'goalkeeper' Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble,
That style of play continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a 'goal' due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball wide after handing it to another Livingston player.
Ballen were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for a 'penalty' - following Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of play and their staff have not changed much since returning to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Head Halkett was very big in his games, organising a tremendously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards well this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - they only once managed to break up the defense of the team that was playing on their own pitch - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) people were laughing and hearing blues as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and believed to be an ‘autocrat' from others.
Road collision in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The crash happened a few months after another cyclist died after hitting a car and driving down Childers Street, about a mile from last Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
The Long-Term Prisoner: Six of the men are in prison
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were brought in to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will be clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to prison to address a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with 'pool' balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Quick Floods (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves through the southwest of the Desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already set up a quick flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Phoenix Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Center of the Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other southwestern areas of the Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from 1 to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall can be a positive thing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route leads to touching the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will lie 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific so it loses strength.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico by the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," they said from the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenager was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to hospital where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
The officials appealed to anyone who might have any footage taken from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'sends the wrath and anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "send the green light and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "the American people saw the bravery and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a juror with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't dispute, but in truth, I dispute," he said.
"So I am running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote inside the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the number of deaths apparently increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many being carried away as massive waves surged down beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) fell to the ground as it began to dark, while many were carried away and killed and everything in the middle was destroyed.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not get up to run immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing at the BNPB.
"The tsunami did not emerge alone, it pulled cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that surrounded themselves and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Heavy thunderstorms continued to rattle the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located on the edge of a long and narrow beach, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicentre.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," they said by the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of the amateurs shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting warnings with anxiety for the tsunami approaching people on the way down.
Within a few minutes a huge amount of water flowed down the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe blackout that slowed communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll far exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltering armed tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they passed through scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant disaster relief process, some of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that beautify this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other of those captured at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the downfall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent out, desperately, WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only signaled that they had left, but did not signal that they had arrived.
"I think that means that the messages did not arrive," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while the ATM was being refilled at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While occupied with his work, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program which he cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the program's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'," West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us, it's us.
From Kanye meaning ‘the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who has collaborated with West, JAY-Z, also serves with or without dash and capital letters.
U.S. military says it will not use military force against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA announcements, even though there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are much further behind the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major AI acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the highest ranking player of American Othello, and later was executive with Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it will be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard in order to get grants from the government.
Lee said, "It's not China that is removing academic leaders; corporations are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green card should be automatically offered to people who have a Doctorate in IA".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "the Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbor in its north represents a possibility of ownership of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slav majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was assembling a small stage and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would make a boycott of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we must proudly enter under our own conditions, not by commanding others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says membership in NATO will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it would represent the government's first serious blow to pro-Western ideologies since it took over in May last year.
Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes from all of Brighton's defence to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his ‘goal' in the 65th minute seem very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran among Brighton's three defenders before running into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green shirts.
He fought with one defender before escaping much further to the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he passes the ball on his left and finds Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute it to Aguero, who used his right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it from where Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
We had the good fortune to ‘goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That 'goal' took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the territory of Brighton in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left side in a very nice way.
Sane touches the ball a little before leading Sterling to where the post is.
The Sky Blues striker slightly touched the ball and put it into the net just before sliding into a territory he was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes he can be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which they face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to gain a possibility of continuing to compete with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking to get the division's first title.
"Even though we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the "pitcher" in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting 34 times, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The Washington right-handed player is 18-7 with a 2.53<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> ERA and 300<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> strikeout<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> in 220 2/3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> innings this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation pertaining to the choice for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I'm not contesting, but in truth, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happen now," Trump said.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means possible, you can see the green.
They don't care who they hurt, who they fly to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them."
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and he was calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator ranked in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received many negative shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, I expect, first of all - her body movements were not positive at all - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The group is no longer a large group.
Don't allow people to express their opinions
When my local party activists voted to censor me, I didn't take it seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour Party MPs who was not positively welcomed - because we have communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's General Council meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my understandings and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it makes no difference what I say - they follow me with an abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my position as MP, denouncing the center's politics, and telling me that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who every day face a lot of sexual abuse or racism but are never hidden from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years that has encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, not to be so vocal and then everything will be "okay."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Ever since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I've never been in politics, even in the past.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats that would remove me from my post or of political expediency would deter me from acting at all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who has not yet lost once, climbs to the top of the rankings
Two attempts could have slightly altered the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this game of the day so exciting of the Tennant's Premiership.
They are currently ranked first in the rankings, the only team out of all ten that have not lost once.
In the end, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing on its own pitch, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been through trials during our matches so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We give credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the better opportunities than us."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's headmaster Rory Hughes, which was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggott made a non-contempt.
Climo extended Ayr's win with a 'penalty', before, in the middle of the match exactly, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to get 17-5 points for Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted from Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
It then stopped the game due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who came out of the pitch on a stretcher, and upon restarting the game, Ayr continued to score points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted from Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of tough pressure.
However, the team playing on their own pitch started attacking again, and when given a yellow card to Struan Hutchinson for his action on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground in the back of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did once again almost from the area from which the game would resume, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that met David Armstrong out of the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays side by side, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing on her own pitch.
The character of Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's personality Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular programme, in which he writes and shares with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the final one of the program, and it appears that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to official records lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's "very well-performing restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen passage to the Pacific
Seafarers stand guard of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean-coloured blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail into the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is obviously awaiting the outcome with positive thinking," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favor of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia an outlet.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court would rule in favor of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's judgment comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "wasn't complicated" said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from resolving Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been unhelpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' hostile rhetoric weakened any of Chile's residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
He passes his comments as U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that is stagnating more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is "hope in the void" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an armament that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headwear that will soon appear in the main stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that graced the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers flew their surprising creations on stage.
The object that stood out most from Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large-sized accessories included a jelly-clad watermelon, a wizard's hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One reaction resembled the diving apparatus complete with snorkels and goggles, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone .
And if you continue with this good-luck style.
Fashionistas predict that huge 'bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a wide edge of two feet worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the impractical hat that has been widely seen on social media has aired another great creation on stage – a straw bag that contains almost as much as the model dressed in a mesh she was carrying.
The dark orange raffle basket, surrounded by tiny raffle twine and white leather grips, was the most notable creation at the 2019 Jacquemus Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm expecting to see large hats and sea bags in the main stores for the summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only bolstered with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a topic of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If a man speaks in a language that he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks in his own language, he understands with his own heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are leading in the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French and 63 percent who study Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a choice of subject, being kept in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that out of reasons given by employers for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn another language, it will have a real advantage in the future as it will have the ability to last a lifetime like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's the fair of the fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego.
LeBron James's sports fans have been waiting for him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six matches before the Lakers' season starts.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five demonstrations scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in Nov.
What do you think of Trump's visit to West Virginia and how do you see it online?
Trump's demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's demonstration in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign has thus said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we get closer to the busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's demonstration can gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So, where do you think the momentum is right now?
"They were in the lead with six points and now we're at four, so I think we're carrying this as a bit of a momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in front with twelve more to play.
Americans, Spieth says, feel but that they have a few setbacks and have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is leading by example.
That heartbreaking shout of celebration continued to grow as his round went on, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth game evenly when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His punt who won the game over 15 was met with a similar outcry, the kind that tells you he believes the American team is still there.
"You've got to get in deep and worry about your own item," Spieth said.
This is what each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon nine.
That run, and the way their energy seems to move both towards and from this live crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun descends on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still early for it.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon completed by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get close to.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch closely because of peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so it came here and was in the lead on the final day but this session of the foursomes also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the part of the US, were doubting.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes in the lead with 10-6 over the United States.
The pair inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead in the Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, taking the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not reach the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight of Sunday's 12 single-player matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs then they worked excellently to beat Woods who did not seem optimistic and to the new American player for the season Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who struggled in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2<0x26>1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But it wasn't all that Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a little breeze in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They achieved a courageous 2<0x26>1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in Ryder Cup history that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although Furyk's side holders needed a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be going to be more than they can do.
North Korea says 'in no way' it will unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "considerable good will measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared to be significant that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without thought as Pyong had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula."
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal coherently, and even objects to the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this block."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Cathy President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on missiles.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeline for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it makes no difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the U.N. Security Council that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without stalling until we realize fully and finally verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after North Korea in a few hours criticized him for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to get all of its undergraduate students to sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
An academic has found that university students in the first place in the world often don't have an idea about the basic real things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
Finally a girl came over to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to capture the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect from a sleep deficit, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, di-stress and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it's not going to change students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as much as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that "you managed to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he gets enough sleep, and of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep puts the mind in a hungry mode, making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to make a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as for when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can unbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered the divided side of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while they were travelling from Hebrox's 4-1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat away in 18 matches as manager of Prepshi's eight-pointed side.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' list of players lacking inspiration never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after Linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown by fans of the team that played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to Ayr's side for the Betfred Cup semi-final.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form hindered their opponents continuously.
Rangers could have dominated possession but Livingston made more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-ever lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Free-kicking strong Keaghan Jacobs then found skipper Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only shoot from the back.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a fifteen-minute penalty on the mark as he and Steven Lawless crashed but referee Steven Thomson ignored the appeals of the Komobian.
Rangers managed to aim well just two shots in the first half of the match but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely bothered him by Lassana Coulibaly's blow to the head and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he deserved them just for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs's good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to select Menga to finish the action.
Gerrard reacted in the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shoots at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to draw visitors to play just the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their leading position in the final stages but McGregor held on well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went in the open from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Contractor of Geiger
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, like today 136 years ago today, and to this day we are still alive... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, Geiger's Contractor has become a cornerstone of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring those unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Is that the madman?"
Rogers: "That Contactor of Geiger, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cupboards, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms giving radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, she's definitely popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63 years old.
But the invention of his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and how they are "taught" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West Performed a Verbal Attack in Favor of Trump, While Wearing Beritta of MAGA, After His Appearance on SNL.
That's not a good mark
Kanye West was booted into the studio on Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a make America Great beret, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you please Trump, what's racist?'
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America," he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to laugh at West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him after the quintet about his beer.
"I'm going behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that blanket."
"Shut me up!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the lost? and he went on to say that he was going to "put on my superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered a booing at least twice by the audience and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "In the whole studio a great silence fell."
West brought him in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West congratulated many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Bottle of Perrier.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR LEAVING THE FOLLOW."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and that's something incredibly beautiful."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is FREE.
So much so," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "what was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend who is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder on knife-wielding in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in throwing the sword as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, talked about the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often feel that they need to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and had doubts about how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones costumer Rose Leslie, has admitted he has "strong interests" in addressing the issue.
"Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its many male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
It's very clear that something has gone wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in this way she gave me my future family, and my life from then on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won in Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a shift from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member revealed GOP senators' data, says "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat ascertained that the claims were being spread by pundits and "ultra right-wing" websites.
"Lies, lies and more lies are worth distasteful," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters's office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The defendant's motives should not be called into question.
It must be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running for the Waters seat in the mid-term elections, also made his voice heard on Twitter.
"That's a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be kept legally accountable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and every one of my staff members."
Johnny English's Criticism Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, an imitation of a powerless spy
It has now become traditional to look for meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life again in 2011 with Johnny English.
The ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of how obviously bad we are, would be the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and moving parts on his face had the license renewed a second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything else proves to be a widespread comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoers' territories.
Of course he is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet charm has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a large piece of that man who contributed one note to Chariots of Fire's London theme melody at the opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man whom Atkinson had once done his part in the advertisements of Barclaycard TV, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this latest issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armour and the blades of the propellers stuck to his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather poor and extra strangely, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as an ingredient confidently.
Humor is felt as if aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's unlucky incidents were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's wordless film jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's highly secretive web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the agent's disappointment that he was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperious and difficult figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrator operative: a few good jokes here as English offers a School of Rock type spin academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former very patient partner, Bough, interpreted once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a smelly one role interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little wasted.
So the inseparable two who always confuse everything in her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet tech billionaire who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce fun behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use Virtual Reality mugs to familiarize himself with the interior.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as he is, he has little idea of children's television.
It's something moderate.
And like the other Johnny English films I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role he really deserves for his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work a four-day week but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons work a four-day week - but be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the bosses of the companies to pass on the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking the same pay with them.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and plans that the country tilts in favour of workers.
The switch to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "I expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "the profiteers" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their full share as a Labour government may make a "cut" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Sure, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said as I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after that allegation came out, I said, "Did I do it?"
He was determined, determined, inquisitive."
However, Graham's vote, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it has to be a very big indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone who mentions it can't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did Something to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive mission; to end the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event ending poverty30.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "click-to-tweet" - do people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from those who put it up, which stands for a number of different goals.
These actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the safe funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people across the country.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising Rwanda to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denaturing a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman's ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website you ask "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we will fail and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses Navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, United States Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that grooms itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leveraging and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "someone with one skill" with an economy that depends on carbs.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to chair Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gassed project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2, which is expected to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'examine whether to run for president in 2020', Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said she will "examine thoroughly" whether to stand for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider going out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine whether to run for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think she should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The poll showed more support for the election exit by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting for a potential election exit and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed in relation to a potential exit for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and charged over a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returned, I can relate to other families who feel PTSD ramifications and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they return a little differently, they return stronger, they return thinking about whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military gave to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged over a domestic violence attack on a woman, interrogating with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday filed a court friend's case in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in Grace's case against Sessions brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and the sons members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
The state's lawyers who are backing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers went on to argue in the event that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in fight against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she was hugging her baby with fever at an evacuation center in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their flooded belongings, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were too full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in his back and shoulder, remained outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continued strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported feeling the violent earthquake move the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance to save ourselves.
Crushed with the remnants of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was at the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week later, a Chinese official newspaper issued a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has seen them go through rounds of tariffs on the imports of each of them.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa's longtime former governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is under restriction of the Chinese Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Relucting Women Voters Ahead of Midterm Elections with Kavanaugh Debate, August Analystians
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
The emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be of a very high level," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying that they were already high; and true.
"But they can be higher, particularly between female voters who switch votes in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing its sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested it could follow an adverse reaction if the Republicans lead with confirmation.
"This has become a complete shake-up for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," indicated Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over believers in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed definitively or probably Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitively or probably Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford as well as at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominion of the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data shop unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings appropriate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some in-staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victory Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
The Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never aware that he won Britain's highest military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award winning.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in plenty of fog and fire from on-site rifles and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before going to a rifle on the spot alone and unconscious three of the troop.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put up a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of ending up with a Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you would have stayed up all night to see a Bellator 206 packed to end up barred from seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party member on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "some kind of fun joke."
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Belator chairman Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something," said Coker.
"But right now it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we're not going to be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
I believe, when the broadcast was turned over there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that the next time will not happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and try to get more to the fans and instead go too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like you boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, were the true things that gave me the power and strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world winner said that when he fell in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "it was a surprise" for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had similar beautiful and unpleasant experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked for was if they already had the tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, p<0xC3><0xA0>'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead which I finally recognized wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed all my life - to dive in front of a crowd from my country at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first choice of his song - Proud of Heather Small - which was compatible with him on his Olympic walk and still ignited the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape stays on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his form to avoid being a not-so-happy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a 12-time record, stayed on the bench from captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as he has often been for the United States, the big five-time winner split his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance in the hope of rectifying his worries.
One who never gave the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult Le Golf National racetrack, where the long distance racked over and over again punishes wrong shots.
And if the course alone is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined new-to-season Tommy Fleetwood, to win all their four matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points lower than the start of the 12th single game, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tapping on my back and putting his arm around me and saying it'll be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably wouldn't have played two games.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He needs to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has rather never reached its individual record mills.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought a few things intangible to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players took pleasure in criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to watch.
It provides a lot more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn said that the large front position could disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable front position before the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point lead over the Americans but ended with a narrow true margin scratch, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
"It remains to remind yourself that we had a big front position at Valderrama; we had a big front position at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but with a little bit," Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class of 2018 win 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday.
So the story will show me and everyone on this team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll go with your body and mind.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over yet until you've got points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we are trying to win this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Happy with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I never went oltr<0xC3><0xA8> step by me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you'll be tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, to bring out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he will go out and bring out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe did the "Miracle of Medina."
"I remember to the very least a word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get to that start quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When it comes to that one-sided momentum, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We made our list accordingly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men this way because I think it covers the whole road," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new war has been postponed once again.
The German Navy's newest navy frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War-era frigates, but it will not be there at least until next year due to systems with flaws and rising local cost, media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic post-delivery issues tarnished the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some precautionary technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic synthesizers.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delay means that the ships of the latest technology - which mentioned allowing Germany to project power offshore - will already be old by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm <0x26> Voss's shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workers on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a well-overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is understood to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest regiments become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a shortage of ships to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem grew over time, because old vessels were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is named after the secret life of the batsman
New ground-based research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipestrelles and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and which species is doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of their behavioural landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting roofing and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light can also pose a risk, such as poison cards to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecclesiastical technique to point out insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, hosting eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old building, a lot of veteran trees and the whole good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and young, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Butterflies are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or annoy them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Night Butterflies Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has commented claims of rape against him as "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to search the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that on that day he had paid her $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said the Ballon d'Or winner five times while looking into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They have to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents that were filed at Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "well-mannered" disappointed with the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by retaliation" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to overturn the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he joined Italian football legend Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "regrets forever" that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "regrets forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a halt in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern relates to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for on-order cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border barrier that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not just the success to be enjoyed at the moment but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the United union's defender at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, it was announced a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "would prefer not" to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a breakdown with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a week period, which delayed further full Senate voting.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When questioned about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date for this has not yet been set, it may be this week, and it may be next week due to all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", though she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more Q<0x26>A sessions compared to any president that was there before him," she added without citing any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is by far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and we've seen it do that many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when he visits dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves in a relaxed and sometimes strange manner in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months away from leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is definitely an unstable time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to support now as much as I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we wish you very much to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Suffering a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie performed emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went over the side line and like he fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's suspended second year, is in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in total he had five tackles before coming out of the game, leading to the total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when they buy property in the UK with the extra money being used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-tax payers in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help the homeless.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on non-tax-paying individuals and firms in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's efforts to combat road sleep.
The surcharge - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which are increasing prices and making it harder for new buyers to make the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut so that more young people would be helped to buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in order to fix the "shameful housing situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post to reversing the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we are going to have to revamp our housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as the bustling residents of the UK.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish is taking up the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with three points difference from the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told the BBC's Sportsound of Scotland.
"But when I was a child I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names at such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"Right now, the success for me will be based on 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I only succeeded here if I managed to get the club back there."
Ross has only been three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant chief at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the edge of the relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Regarding when Alloa took over, he recalled that "Probably this was a big change."
"I thought the manager's position was the most suitable one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange because I was going well, I had a decent living, and I enjoyed some reasonable gains.
However, playing games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to go through each week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

A survey found that the best time to take a pint of beer is at 5.30pm in the evening.
The summer heat wave has boosted the earnings of UK pubs in difficulty but has put more pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business advisory, who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model to the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are drinks were the ones that performed the most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
The pubs whose main sale is food also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to get out.
In managed pubs and bars drinking sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food dropped to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors in terms of take-away market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly heavy in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sale is food and only time can advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new businesses.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta's "false" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "false Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a presentable "main" account to show off to their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "stupid me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and from the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the track and non-track athlete who has mostly won medals and president Ian Beattie has described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly as she becomes part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic Games gold medals and is now a regular critic of the BBC, finished off after suffering a minor stroke attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was in a state of shock.
I couldn't move.
The doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a hard job but I recovered completely, I learned how to sleep again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow-cows that are being weaned.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the world's first wearable and noise-free breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers to use the pump.
Four real mothers dance in a matmura filled with the straw of a cow with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case you didn't realize they're not nipples but breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump out, pump out, I’m hugging my babies, pump out, pump out, I’m hugging my women.”
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page, caused online controversy.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows are used to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Realism is really out of touch with reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a good idea.
If I were to buy one, I would buy one.
It made me feel the same as a cow.
It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm pretty sure it was.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with the unattended pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a sucking bra without giving an eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump to the dairy cows we wanted to focus on the pumping of the breast and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun way and in a way that one can relate to, the incredible sense of freedom that the pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walked Without Words to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite monthly border crossings remaining largely unchanged, partly because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that presenting themselves to take care of a child would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their brood would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are located here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we continue to look for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video phone conference, rather than in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or sad, which can lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to escape.
Lawyers said that this concern increases in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child would be finding it difficult, given the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their peers can lead to trauma many of them are already struggling.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we expel from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions were right for them to return, and blamed "in some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major powerful rebel has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to call soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to the revision of articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
With this logic, in 2020 Mr. Trump will win re-election provided, as many liberal viewers are hoping, that the denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This is without a doubt the "most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it seems that the viewers are not satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC increased cable television ratings with even 3.5 million viewers in major news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why bother me,'" Mrs. Scovell said.
In this case, there is the value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the storytelling titles emanating from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond the fact of being an informed citizen when at six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sources for his book "Fear," the smelly-skinned bomber jacket from Paul's post-'$5,000 worth of clothing," said The Washington Post.
I'll never look back on Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it as though this is a reality show is that every night he's delivering something to you," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and development in the daily plot of the Trump program.
You can't afford to lose one episode because otherwise you fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was sunny at 80 degrees in Kauai's north coast, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand out from the front of the television, not when there was a Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those exceptional programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were actually right."

Large amounts of money coming in from abroad for the tightest races in the White House midterm election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is seeing a large quantity of money, thanks to a re-alignment of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the Pitts of the suburban district of Pittsburgh Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running as a candidate against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's twelfth old district, extending far over the new seventeenth district.
The maps were re-established after in January the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally tampered with in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic National Campaign) and the National Republican Committee (Republican Committee) Campaign.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election widely followed for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat was Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Decided Not to Do It
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to re-contact U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert, in a statement at the start of this.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticized for addressing the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and tough message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were backed up by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next unexpected negative event may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go again before voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I am not aiming to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor that of his European equivalent.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, had the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, Americans are faced with many of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated that he is not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said that The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s new requested Brett Kavanaugh investigation is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual conduct and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take a long time for democracy to move.
But I don't think I'm going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light the candles on that table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, following the equally impressive result they brought to Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 tie with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came up with a point.
We could probably have won it in the end but, overall, an even result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Tomorrow is going to be a big European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but despite this there is a sense of positivity at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is being good.
I hope that now we can do our best, forget the last season and be successful."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wished to be inducted, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in Nationwide's study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who cares for them, but they're not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You should start like that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid money value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents at length: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is ready."
A man was struck several times by shots of an air rifle in Ifracombe
A man was struck several times by shots from an air rifle as he was walking home after an evening out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when she was hit by shots in the chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "casual act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communication lines damaged, aid officials could not obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a range extending along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is concentrated mostly in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast with great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed due to a collapsed building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's north side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, the KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his plea, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the domestic violence crime report, and having a weapon in his possession while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The media is circulating videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death sentence
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking Sayfullo Saipov who is the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people to be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, by flying in October to pedestrians and cyclists who happened to be on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of charge carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury awarded Saipov 22 indictments that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized racketeering, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the way in which Saipov carried out this "gracious, cruel and immoral" attack, prosecutors said the attack required "substantial prior planning and meditation."
The notice on intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego and Hernan Diego".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York's Southern District last prosecuted a case of the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced in September 2009 to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiring to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed through the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22nd charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said they were "certainly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty to life in prison with no possibility of release will continue to only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MP Tory says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised he would "mobilize the people's army" .
The former head of the Ukip said politicians had to "feel pressured" by Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the UK "would have come out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by Tories who is not pro-Brexit who has joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction she would keep moving forward to try to reach a deal with Brussels - forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "put aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone out by now," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to put aside the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be serfs.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is absolutely not true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory's Brexiteer, was also present at the demonstration, where she told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are really the ones who go to the streets and who vote for us first.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Mrs May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they were to back down from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let you go if you do this'."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit this country's people's army which has brought us success and we will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists trended banners with writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis who holds a high social position in the Labour party has ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have all the IT systems in place and the technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full-blown farm.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "carefully examine" the possibility of running for the presidential election
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will "carefully examine the possibility of going out for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to go out for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims which occurred Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the man featured in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told media "Wayde Sims suffered from a wound caused by a gunshot to the head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to having shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept in custody at the East Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the world title after his team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the breakout zones and left Hamilton racing with the others in the group's last place, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stopping area after another lap and exited just after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after a little wheel action with a wheel which led to the Ferrari driver leaving with difficulty the inside free due to the risk of giving up after a double shift to defend.
Max Verstappen started from the grid's rear row and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap on his birthday at the age of 21.
He then stood in front for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of finishing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually entered the stopping zone in the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and it was a true gentleman saying let me by.
The team did a truly exceptional job of getting first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was a Really Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and nasty and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are outraged and vile and nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures and then say 'no, I didn't do it.
I did not do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, reveal any information?
Remember her answer... reveal the document - "e, e, what is it?
No you don't see.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday evening's rally: "You know what I know, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been revealed, but that's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You're seeing the virility, the disgust, they don't care who hurts, who sticks to the wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars clinched to Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained a two-goal advantage early in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score to the team playing at home before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard achieved the same score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who after several defeats advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning all three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal occurred in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pace from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford giving the pace while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with plenty of action, Sullivan brought the home-based team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave a pass to Cownie at 15:16 bringing the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants gain an advantage until the game's first break when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team playing in his home country was reunited and thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team again with a strong goal in 27:37.
Queenie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time advantage in the game at the end of the second period and secured the win with a fifth goal for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure That Hundreds Of People On The Plane Will Be Able To Escape From The Terremot
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The area has been under heavy fire and many of them are trapped in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled to rescue, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that was swinging at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then sitting on the runway, could leave safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this we feel very sad," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters destroyed Palu in which a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance goes in.
Clean water is scarce.
"Mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night in order to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that was operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she could not give details on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said last week that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon just away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water that was high up to their waistline until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered from a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to improve a wharf also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the past two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents but no accident involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of having in 2014 burned a woman from Mississippi while she was alive.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to gather together information on the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When mobile phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city at the time.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He took it out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
Three hip hop artists want to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has gone beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and again make the hip hop conscious popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY sues couple for having fired her after "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the cause to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnation when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEE PERSUNA ANOTHER SEWEEN," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her thick mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was instead waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she had been initially employed, despite not having a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do things like that," she told the Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims that they are racist, saying that expelling Mrs. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife gave her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you trust your children into the hands of someone who spoke to you with a guff, even if it was a mistake?
your child's birth?
and come on."
Comparing the cause to "extortion", Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had had the baby and she was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blame someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's really fun the fact that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book by a young toy bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "pleasant but somewhat overshadowed by his sadness after his death."
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never would have talked about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to achieve something: be proud of them even if it isn't you who has achieved something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone.
As soon as she gave birth to her daughter, she was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last greeting.
And so I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
be with you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slowly.
She had died a short time before and she started to cringe.
All I could do was sit back and wait, aware that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had so far been crying for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a rashy face, and tears began to fall all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were attaching cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Sydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
However, he had to give up work before he died, because he was in "a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even if you are a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to speak up."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not too long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he made no contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they wanted to fight her: "Leave a gap in the family.
Fragments.
But we all want to continue with our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we could achieve something like what he asked for it - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - maybe we would have brought a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "crushing" among party-rooted paralysis.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is wholly due to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in which case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy position 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserts 'decreased' under Kim
The number of North Korean desserts for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the South Side unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug, said there were 1,127 changes to the party last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of the deserts from the North Side would almost certainly be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the deserts as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stagnant denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free from nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho stuck to U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Mr Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is unable to work in the Supreme Court due to his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think of the fact that if a woman had ever behaved in that way, they would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even yelling and choking when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not work in the Supreme Court, because it showed he had anti-Democratic biases.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi stood when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not appropriate for a person with hysterical bias to go to court and wait to say, 'Very good,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she can't say what she has to say without crying.
"We cry when we're sober," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "It helped me a lot a woman who was met somewhere else, who said that she was crying when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she was raised and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'Probably you think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm screwed up."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant."
Crying is allowed as a way to vent one's great anger partly because fundamentally they are misinterpreted.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman grabbed me by the collar - a cold manager I always feared - and carried me to the neck.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're screwed.
They think you're upset and feel happy that they've managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was about to run for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and exited the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply shocked, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of coming out herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a good decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to run for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she swore she would not go out for the election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her fans who had given $1,000 to the men to her had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to make a mistake?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, raised with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and raised with sexism - that she was strangled.
"Probably you'd think I had a strong brake," Ms. Schroeder recalled about the way the media reacted to her.
"I used to think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"She cried"?'
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombs of the opening of the US-China trade war have been dwindling, and while the battle is still to end, a lack of agreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the demands, but publicly the fact that China has ceded the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works judiciously, U.S. trade war pressures could support China in a positive way in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security (Center for a New American Security).
Syria says it is "ready" for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the expedition.
The winner of the Ryder Cup in Europe
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points he needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is prominent in the United States, who struggled throughout the tournament, gave up his tip-to-the-water coup in the 16th par-3 hole, giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari golfer has stood out in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to ever bring 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5<0x26>4 against the lowest level player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 for England's Ian Poulter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia has become the best European player of the tournament ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I normally don't cry, but today I couldn't hold on.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia emotional after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup record 13-21-3 throughout his career.
One of the best players ever to have won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
Our argument.
To Thomas we take down the hat.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reunite, I will work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You'll have to grab the hat and tilt your head.
It's better than it."
