The rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that approximately 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e., have a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 has worsened into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% have a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who stayed in hospital due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA (EU/EEA) and UK (UK) country and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveilance issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases by France were reported on 24 January 2020 of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), as between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting the Cumulative Number and Cumulative Rate of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the numbers of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess trends for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases over 14 days, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases reported over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the UK followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., another 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the total number of cases already similar to that in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, and despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of different case definitions in different countries and protocols to select patients to be tested for COVID-19, including a follow-up test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to be collected in a systematic manner to supplement existing surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a wide variety of intensive care and intermediate care beds available in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive care and average care per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK for COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a 90% excess capacity of intensive care beds, are available in the European Centre for Disease Control’s (ECDC) COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment Update 6.
Since cases have so far been collected in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide case information and intensive care beds at the naming level of the regional units of Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transition to SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment, a comprehensive, proactive rapid approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly in the event that it is not pre-implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is limited opportunity for countries to step up their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients needing focused care over the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, similar to the SARS-CoV virus, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also transmit from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and influential among older people than young people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of disease epidemiology, its causes, virology, diagnosis, treatment, disease progression prediction and prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday period and for many weeks thereafter due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its associated disease was named CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is “Public Enemy No. 1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 COVID-19 researches have been published that have included the virology of the disease, its epidemiology, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report was released on 7 January 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of preventing and predicting the course of the disease as well as some pressing questions that remain to be asked.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, and have mainly caused about 15 percent of the four common colds.
However, in this century, we have faced severe disease-causing coronaviruses in humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread the disease to many other countries with a terrifying prevalence and death rate.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with Pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, cases of infection were reported among health care providers, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was closed down with all public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which considered the site of infection initiation from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation rapidly evolves, the final scale and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age groups, but mainly affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded mainly among groups in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8–13) days.
The basic reproduction number (base reproduction number) was 3.77 (confidence range 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted base reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted death rate per patient was 3.06% (confidence range 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a family of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded positive-direction RNA genome.
It can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and it is known that the coronaviruses of sexual alpha and beta infect humans.
The sugar protein S-coated forks bind to their cellular receptors angiotensin II enzyme (ACE2) and peptide 4 dipeptide 4 (DPB4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the RNA is combined with glycoproteins and capsid-nucleoproteins to form vesicles containing virions, which combine with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequencing samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
It was revealed through an electron transfer microscopy that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
The human angiotensin II converting enzyme has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S protein is associated with a weaker human angiotensin II enzyme than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and limit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any scale or pattern with a known function.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. reported the complete length structure of human ACE2 under a supercooled electron microscope with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> within a compound with an amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had grouped together to form a demerit and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to the S protein, providing evidence to identify the coronavirus and infection.
The sodium-based neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via the civet cats and camels, respectively.
Comparing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus being 96 percent identical to bat-like SARS-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the interfamilies barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the course of transmission has yet to be clarified.
Jie et al. proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved symmetrical recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous anteaters – long-tongued anteaters often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic symmetry of 99% in the coronavirus discovered in SARS-CoV-2 anteaters and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes still makes a big difference; therefore, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; it can ether, ethanol at a concentration of 75%, disinfectants containing chlorine, pyroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies concerning other coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after an invasion of a host virus, the normal immune system recognizes it through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRS), including C-type receptors similar to ketene, TLR-like receptor, NLR-like receptor, and RIG-I-like receptor.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the appearance of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies dedicated to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Assisted T cells produce inflammation-stimulating cytokines to help the adjuvant cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by inducing programmed T-cell death.
Mixed immunity, including complement proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies neutralized a recovered MERS-CoV patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, failure of multiple organ functions and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been damaged to be more likely to become infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1–14 days, or mostly 3–7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and then prevent people who are infected but asymptomatic from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo a 14-day quarantine.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thrombophlebitis.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened, even without imaging revealing the presence of pulmonary abnormalities, for an early diagnosis of the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group where the infection came from a person who did not show symptoms.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent), and shortness of breath (55 percent) as the main symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them required much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with Mers’s higher death rate from COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 percent, while confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
By comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a June 2012 demographic study.
A previous study reported that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence range (CA) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV ranged from just 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their own symptoms, mortality rate, and basic reproduction number is shown in table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater proliferation potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is much more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of the disease in gatherings often occurs in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or having contact with people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovered patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphocytopenia was detected with white blood cell count <0x26>lt;4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte count <0x26>lt;1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, elevated levels of the aspartate amino transporter and blood secretion in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients, increased C-reactive protein and the rate of red blood cell overload in most patients.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of D-damer D, which is caused by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, has increased, and the number of lymphocytes has gradually decreased.
Imaging abnormalities appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-glazed shades or sanded glass opacities in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis severely affect the exchange of gases.
Dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 pulmonary cells reduces the level of surface tonic and increases the surface tension, thus, reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst results of chest X-rays are often compared to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell exfoliation, hyaluronic membrane formation, interstitial lymph nodule, and multi-nucleated cellular cells in the lungs of a patient who had died of the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to that of patients with severe respiratory distress.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, because of the high false negative outcome rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of the diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings is essential to making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting pieces of SARS-CoV-2-created RNA at a rate of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moly/l to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moly/l with 10-100 copies per microliter of input.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide supportive care mainly for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or previously proposed to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that release angiotensin II-converting enzyme, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMOH), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Stimulant hormones, tocilizumab, and a monoclonal anti-interleukin 6 antibody have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm immunosuppressive therapies include T-cell-guided immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; Plinatomumab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and histone destylase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses have not been helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially aneurysms, which can severely affect the prognosis of the disease.
However, short cycles of anabolic hormones in small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective anti-retroviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was discovered that giving Rimdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, intravenously was effective in a U.S. COVID-19 patient.
Remedicipher is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remedicipher also showed potential inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, the compound Gilead has submitted to China for some trials on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parisitinib, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combination therapy with plopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and the generation of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (AG) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to put this method to widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some of the defects associated with plasma need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode active antibodies, or screening for active antibodies against the virus’ core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are highly dependent on a combination of multiple components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and verify for these ingredients or their optimal formulations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Feng Jie Do capsules and Lian Hua King Win capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 was discovered.
The highest cure rates for treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only TCM with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a very rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Zhang and his co-workers published a study comparing Western Medicine Treatment (WM) alone to the combined treatment of Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time needed to recover from high body temperature, symptom relief, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group than in the Western Medicine-only treatment group.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom exacerbation (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western <0x2B> TCM treatment group than in the Western <0x2B> TCM treatment group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western <0x2B> TCM treatment group than in the Western <0x2B> TCM treatment group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting more well-studied trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of procedures and to clarify the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel a strong fear of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by stimulant hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the initial stage of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut off the chain of transmission of the virus from animal reservoirs and infected humans to vulnerable hosts are necessary and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS treatment.
However, the efficacy of these live-body candidate vaccines and lethal challenge models in preventing infection with the zoonotic virus was not determined in the elderly prior to the start of a clinical study.
Perhaps this is because SARS faded 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic cases and groups of MERS persist in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive virus, deoxyribonucleic acid plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is challenging due to the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover with impunity.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also linked to high prevalence rates and deaths in severe patients.
Therefore, building a model of disease prognosis is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the outlook for COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The 30- to 65-year-olds were mainly infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (on average age 66 versus 51), indicating age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Accompanying diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiac accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with the angiotensin II enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The association between C-reactive protein level and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, the elevation of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH), aspartate amine transporter (AST), alanine transporter enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunctions in the heart or liver.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest X-rays and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict COVID-19 outcomes and complications.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as an adjuvant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose anabolic steroids are widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered angioplasty with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose, short-term steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, severe uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and their sick colleagues.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were in a severe illness, while most transmissions of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Efforts are underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of impeding SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of decline will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-calf and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting the newly discovered virus could become a periodic flu-like attack.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weaker in causing infection and eventually go away or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 travels at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in the feces, raising the possibility of new transmission from the feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions are needed to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have come into contact with sick or injured people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) masks can protect against inhaling small verions as much as 10 to 80 nanometres, with only 5% of the verions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and each is approximately 85 nanometres in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked together, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more disinfectant soap than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020 that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced the public's preparedness, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted critical time containing the disease at its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (i) more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (ii) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (iii) more restrictive to contain and improve a potential epidemic in its early stages than to try to reassure the public of the issuance; and (iv) more restrictive to contain and improve the epidemic in the form of the early-stage response to the disease.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher COVID-19 mortality rate (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even asymptomatically, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, causing greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal RNA screening for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity has been discovered between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Numbers 1 and 2, we can’t stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin II enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to angiotensin II-converting enzyme secreted cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the course of its transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or vanish like SARS, or come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation are driving the co-evolution between coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) caused mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown the other side to reveal how severe and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back into the spotlight, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the ability to cause disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is an animal-derived disease, so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses will serve us well.
Most of the human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses have also been identified.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interaction between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and compare different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the successful switching requirements of the host and the impact of complications of the development of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (coronaviruses) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-direction RNA.
These viruses have the largest RNA genome at 26 to 32 kilobases and are called "coronary viruses" by that name because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structural properties, coronaviruses contain undivided genomes that share a similar organization.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open-reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which convert to the two types of polyproteins cloned pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open-reading templates for structural proteins, including spike (S), casing (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (coronavirus alpha, coronavirus beta, coronavirus gamma virus, and corona virus delta), among which are the types of coronavirus beta that comprise most of the human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (a, b, c, and d).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually broken through species barriers and some have emerged as serious human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, which belong to the coronaviruses Alpha.
The other five beta coronaviruses include the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1, the SARS-CoV-associated coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus.
The human coronavirus E-229, the human coronavirus OC43, the human coronavirus HKU1, and the human coronavirus NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea, or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
She was isolated from the human coronavirus E-229, the first strain B814, from the nasal secretions of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been collected through extensive studies conducted on the human coronavirus E-229 and the human coronavirus OC43, whose symptoms are automatically cured.
In fact, it was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest epidemics in our current history, with more than 8,000 cases and an approximate death rate of around 10 percent.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) broke out, creating a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The novel coronavirus 2019 (NBV-2019), which has been renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm bell rings and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are bats, where the viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The tracing of the animal origins of human coronaviruses showed a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2’s warehouse, intermediate host, and inflated host animal (amplified host animals), with important effects to prevent future spillovers.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and the causes of human coronaviruses in diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that native viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogens after they are transmitted between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the course of the human coronavirus as the increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We are also discussing in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with a cold, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
Presenting a brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract in patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with a fever, and cough in approximately 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and was a subsequent transmission in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is asymptomatic of infection by other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both the human coronavirus E-229 and the human coronavirus OC43 have spread globally, and tend to be transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with the human coronavirus 229E has caused a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe injury to the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first well-documented pandemic caused by the human coronavirus in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be detected.
The first case of SARS occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infection vector, it has been estimated that a single case of infection can lead to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by delayed symptoms of difficulty breathing, cough, and respiratory distress.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In SARS patients, diffuse dendritic injury, phenotypic cell proliferation, and an increase in the number of macrophage cells are also observed.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and HIV patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
The human coronavirus NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as suffocation.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with worsening of acute asthma attacks.
The HCoV-HKU1 virus has been found to be globally prevalent, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and in general the likelihood of them mutating to cause diseases with high prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more severe subtype of the human coronavirus-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe respiratory infection in China.
In general, when coronaviruses acquire this ability to efficiently transmit and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mears-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases brought in from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of close personal contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later identified as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been declared by the World Health Organization as a public health emergency of international importance as called COVID-19.
On 3 March, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial death rate of 3.4%.
The mortality rate in China’s Hubei province is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea also appears in some patients.
Pneumonia is the most serious symptom and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence by 82%, they belong to different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People with no symptoms have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and the time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 shows features that are more common in cases of human coronavirus infection acquired from society, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissibility of human coronaviruses acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is reduced after transmission to humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth noting whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal outbreaks as in cases of human coronaviruses acquired from society.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including the possibility of transmission, disease mechanism and sustainable post-transition spread to humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from society and causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have been survivors of the ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses that infect humans with severe diseases have been eradicated, as have humans infected with severe human coronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face host-restrictive factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it is difficult to stop human-to-human transmission through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The community-acquired four coronaviruses spread among human populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal repository.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue to move between humans.
They need to stay and breed in their animal repositories and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society.
It is highly contagious like human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes more of the disease than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread between them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if it harbors the closely related parent virus and shares a high level of nucleotide sequences.
The parent virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the host hosts the HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts become infected naturally and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
By contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the newly intermediate host just before it attacks humans or nearby, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes comorbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also act as an amplified host by allowing the virus to be temporarily replicated and thus transmitted to humans to expand the scope of infection between humans.
The human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the game.
Serological prevalence surveys then indicated that animal dealers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to normal people.
For the first time, it was determined that the masked palm yoghurt (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the yogurt cats were killed in the market.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV testing of masked palm yoghurt living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that masked palm yoghurt may be only an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also act as SARS-CoV’s amplified intermediate host is not excluded.
It seems that all of these are hosts that do not transport SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for SARS-CoV's animal natural host led to the discovery of the closely related bat coronavirus, which is called the Chinese yellow horsetail bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 (Chinese yellow horsetail bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3).
The result of antibody testing for SARS-CoV in these bats and the sequence of the genome of the yellowish Chinese horse-tailed bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (HKU3) was positive.
This virus and other coronaviruses of bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are a host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none could be isolated as a live virus with the exception of WIV1.
Human angiotensin II enzyme (angiotensin II enzyme) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was shown to use ACE2 in bats, yogurt cats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the potential to equalize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related origin of SARS-CoV in bats, as they share 95% nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV and that bats are not direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of the evolution of MERS-CoV strains combines in the group of coronavirus-HKU4 in bats and coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
Coronavirus-HKU4 is used in bats and MERS-CoV by the host itself, dipeptide peptide4 (dipeptide peptide4), to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA polymerase sequences are closer in terms of strain evolution to its counterparts than the beta coronaviruses in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that MERS-CoV lives in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the coronavirus HKU25 in its closest bats share a nucleotide sequence similarity of only 87 percent.
Thus, bats may not be the direct repository for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only camels are serum-positive Mers-Cove equivalent antibodies, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
MERS-CoV was isolated from the nasal swabs of the monsoon camels, indicating that the camels served as MERS-CoV's original reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms have generally appeared in camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a dense viral scattering has been observed.
Infected camels were noticeably propagating viruses not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route for the virus to be propagating from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases have been attributed logically to human-to-human transmission or unknown routes of transmission involving unidentified species harbouring MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 in isolated bats from horseshoe bats shares 96.2% nucleotide symmetry.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless bat coronaviruses are found to be nearly identical in the future.
The intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are assumed to be among the wild animal species sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood market, which has been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as manis javanica can also harbour the native coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The novel coronavirus genomes of these anteaters and SARS-CoV-2 share a nucleotide sequence similarity of 85-92%.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses cluster in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (receptor binding domain) with SARSCoV-2, with an amino acid sequence matching 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding differ significantly from RaTG13, although the sequence of the entire genome is higher.
A previous study of a sick beekeeper also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out that they were similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the squamous anteater is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequencing variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta viruses in squamous anteaters.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous anteaters, and other mammals is still under designation.
While the highest sequence symmetry has been found in the domains of receptor association between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous anteaters, the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-associated beta coronaviruses share the highest symmetry of the full genome sequence.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains in squamous anteaters belonging to the coronavirus beta and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is a counter-proposal that a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in squamous anteaters belonging to the beta-coronavirus and RaTG13 is likely in the third wild animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta coronaviruses as a driving force of evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of strain evolution has suggested that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while paternal viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-1 were found in rodents.
The coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Aplach Heights Coronavirus) detected in tricolor bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was found to be genetically related to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and was suspected to be its intermediate host.
To illustrate, current information on the animal origins of human coronaviruses known in Figure 1 and Table 2 has been summarized.
An analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of human coronavirus transmissions between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The date of transmission of the human coronavirus-229E between species is still less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to the human coronavirus E-229.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have a connection to bats in a common ecological habitat.
Humans are in close contact with the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E in bats is multi-drug and non-pathogenic, while HCoV-229E in alpaca causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-associated coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that the alpaca was infected with the human coronavirus 229E belonging to the coronavirus alpha cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies, Ebola, Nippah, and Hindra.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit the human coronavirus E-229 to humans directly.
While the alpha coronaviruses in bats act as a gene pool for the human coronavirus-229E, alpacas and monsoon camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in MERS-CoV.
Mears-Cove gives an excellent example of the transition between species as it moves from bats to monstrous camels and from monstrous camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since the beginning of its identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent results.
Clearly, bats provide a rich pool of virus species to exchange genetic fragments within a single species and their transmission between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal “virus dispenser”.
On the other hand, Mears-Cove has moved into the loneliest beauty for decades.
These camels may have adapted well until you switched from a middleman host to a natural, stable warehouse host.
MERS-CoV causes very little disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains coincidental, and man is a non-transmission host for Meers-Coff where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike camels in the MERS-CoV transport, the role of squamous anteaters, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transport is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous anteaters make him very ill.
They may be non-carrier hosts for SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the beta coronavirus, similar to a yogurt cat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will rule out many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animal species and humans by either proving it or excluding it.
First, bats may be a reservoir host of a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous anteaters can be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans become infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of antibodies in pets and wild animals is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may have been recombined and adapted in a third species that has contact with bats and squamous anteaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating the spread of coronaviruses to overcome species barriers.
First, mutation rates have a relatively high doubling of RNA.
Estimated coronavirus mutation rates, compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average switching rate of <0x7E>10-4 switching cases per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include the externally corrected ribonuclease enzyme, which deletes it, resulting in a very high transmutability or inability to develop.
Interestingly, remdesivir is known to suppress the transcription of the coronavirus by inhibiting the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Rimdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than those of flight attendants.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that he has already adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Mers-CoV, which has adapted well to the lonesome camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies evolution, which is helpful in the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.
This is powered by unique abundant open-reading templates and protein functions encoded near the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly swap molds during replication of RNA through a unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixing vessel, sequence switching occurs frequently during copying of the RNA of the coronavirus.
Highly symmetrical full-length and genomic nucleic acids may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence of the evolution of normal recombination strains has been discovered in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as H.I.S.-like coronaviruses in bats and H.I.S.-HKU9 in bats.
Virus interaction with the transport-related host
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In this regard, we consider the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during transspecies transport accidents.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and yogurt cats, SARS-CoV was thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the receptor binding domain of S-protein.
In general, the receptor domain of the coronavirus S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is heavily selected through the body's anti-host response.
In SARS-CoV, the binding range of receptors in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which is associated with angiotensin II enzyme as well as adjuvant receptors for virus entry.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV is able to identify angiotensin II receptor adjuvants in various animals, including bats, yoghurts, mice, and raccoons, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that were different from viral isolates from humans and yoghurts were observed in the receptor binding domain, and 4 of these are found in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The K479N and S487T mutations are found in the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain in yogurt cats, which can increase the likelihood of a spike protein reaction in the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid alternatives may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor found in SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein, which implies that the likelihood of S protein binding in the human angiotensin II enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study of ultra-cold electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association than that which occurs between human angiotensin II-converting enzyme and S protein in SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receptor may be necessary for the SARS-CoV-2 transition.
It is also interesting that HCoV-NL63 is also associated with the angiotensin 2 enzyme but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the N protein analyzer for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylcylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transmission between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also controlled by other factors of host dependency and constraints.
The cross-fertilization of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, monstrous camels, and rodents, may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control host reliability factors and weaken the restriction factors in it to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important space for the interaction of the virus with the host remain detectable and characteristically identifiable.
Widespread unbiased genome screening can be used to investigate the reliability and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of emerging human coronaviruses: back to square one
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of emerging human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic assemblage of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the development of the human coronavirus and are two important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV regulatory proteins, ORF8 was thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as virus-associated SARS-CoV was isolated in bats but was found to encode disparate ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion properties of SARS-CoV were found to exist in isolated strains at the start of the human pandemic.
This deletion has split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through the strains of the alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombination zones identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in NSP9, most NSP10, and parts of NSP14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has seen cases of recombination between different strains, which occurred in the lone hump camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinations have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been synthesized with other animal coronaviruses in their own non-constructive genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely caused by viruses getting rid of selective stressors, such as by the host’s immune system.
The loss of the full-length ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although proper ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-coronavirus that infects alpacas exhibits one nucleotide implant, leading to a frame mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by the selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Unsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have only been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
They showed that bats adapted appropriately to anatomically and physiologically corona viruses.
For example, poor activation of the inflammatory response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens provoked by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to an increase in the rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptor and a decrease in the expression level of NKG2/CD94 key tissue-compatibility composite molecules I.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (reactive oxygen compounds) arising from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress transcription of the coronavirus and influence correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathogenic new strains of the virus.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in stored hosts such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why carriers of the virus who do not show symptoms and the causes of acute conditions see human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
In contrast, in the case of asymptomatic disease carriers, the immune response separates from the replication of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for immune response detachment may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon’s response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I can be used at least in the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle cryoprene NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the inflammatory particle cryopaerene NLRP3 using the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea with which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
At the time it was discovered that the beta coronavirus in bats involved SARS-CoV in 95% nucleotide homogenization, there was also a coronavirus in bats that shared 96% of the nucleotide homogenization with SARS-CoV-2.
While it was discovered that the civet cats and other animals in the market harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, they did not detect direct intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-coronaviruses have been detected in squamous anteaters and are highly homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that squamous anteaters may be one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters have contributed genetic fragments leading to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, not intentionally or by chance.
Coronaviruses have come back into focus due to the start of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our thinking about the importance of zoonotic disease origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and yogurt cats in the markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the killing of yogurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same mental logic, squamous anteaters should be disposed of from fresh product markets to prevent transmission of zoonotic disease, in light of the discovery of multiple strains of beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, as well as how it is transmitted through squamous anteaters and other mammals, its transmission remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-Cove has been found in the lone-skinned camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control Mears, as officials at China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the frequent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, as well as other infection control measures.
Because we can’t completely eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns can arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are highly diverse in bats that have the potential to cause zoonotic diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of human trials due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be developed.
The fact is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural repositories until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats carry many characteristics that suggest the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to better understand the environment and natural hosts of coronaviruses, which proves to be useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
Finally, the best way to prevent zoonotic viral diseases is to keep humans away from the environmental sites of natural reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens.
The mystery of the zoonotic origin of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the virus of origin of SARS-CoV-2 to the squamous anteater, it is important to know the conditions under which bats and squamous anteaters share a similar environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous anteaters.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both observation and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous anteater or other mammal, it is expected to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent viruses from which it branch and which are almost identical to its natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important actions to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
Need to update the "suspect status" and "confirmed status" criteria when diagnosing COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection 2019, which provided our experience and included appropriate reference information to fight the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (VII) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus) outbreak officially became known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was dubbed SARS-CoV-2.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team drafted a rapid guideline and published it online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experiences; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, seven editions in total with some contexts fundamentally changed.
Our guidance is now in response to a comment from Cho and others, who have made a simple step-by-step proposal based on clinical trial.
Their efforts have added new guidance to our guidance as well as becoming a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (experimental version 7) and recent studies.
According to Release 7 (March 3, 2020), confirmation of a suspected case requires combining any one of the elements of epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or it needs to verify three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history that includes travel to the city of Wuhan and/or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported, or residence, within the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) a history that includes communication with SARS-CoV-2 infections (with positive results from a DNA test), or a history that includes communication with patients with a fever or infection; (2)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics proven by imaging examination for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells at a normal, low, or low level of lymphocyte count in the early stage of infection.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case of a suspected case or a suspected case involving any of the elements of evidence for pathogens or serum reactions should be based on: (1) positive real-time BCR test result for SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive Ig-type antibody test result; and (3) positive Ig-type antibody test.
We see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test of DNA in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the 4th (27 January 2020) and 5th edition (8 February 2020); then the blood serum interaction guide was added to the 7th edition.
These modifications have built on the ongoing work of researchers to design an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which have increased the availability of different samples, supporting the transfer of a positive antibody-specific outcome to confirmed status criteria.
Besides, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and asymptomatic conditions.
Therefore, the information flowchart content of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the clinically symptom-free person as “low risk.”
The grading monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to have access to more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose “suspect status” and “confirmed status”, we call for tracking and adherence to the latest guidance from home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, there were 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, stated in an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirgadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will stop for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
Disruption of public transport initially began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods: medical products, fuel and food are still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three had already recovered by 19 March.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeds 1 million worldwide
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus, and the first death linked to it was recorded in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 105,635 confirmed cases, of which 79,332 were in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. CET (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city’s closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries for Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to become all day; it was previously from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the purchase limit for toilet paper per transaction
Australian supermarket chains Wallworths and Coles on Saturday and Sunday night tightened restrictions on buying toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Wallworths and one roll of Coles stores per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi stores also identified one roll, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have stockpiled it due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Wallworth stores approved restrictions on delivering toilet paper to homes, becoming one roll per purchase order.
The changes followed previous restrictions passed by Wallworth stores on March 4 and Coles stores on March 5 by allowing the purchase of only four rolls per transaction.
Coles Stores reported in its March 8 media release that despite the enforcement of the four-roll restrictions, “many stores are still selling everything they have within one hour of receiving it,” and described the order as “unprecedented,” as well as Aldi Stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to a spokesman for Wallworth stores.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the amount allowed to buy is two rolls.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and the delivery frequency increased, Wallworth stores also requested additional inventory, while Aldi stores made their inventory available for specials scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery timing made it difficult.
Production costs are expected to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores will not be able to provide Wednesday’s special offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of stock in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which reinforces the sense of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News, stated that "Coles and Wallworth stores have the view that if there are a lot of goods on the shelves, and if products such as toilet rolls and sterilizers can be [purchased] and supplied in bulk, it may reduce the panic."
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Pepper, which produces sorpent paper, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some property sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily publication in the city of Darwin, included an eight-page advertisement folded so that it could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores initially hesitated about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, with stores saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sterilizers, dried goods, hand lotion and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, a British online store called Okado identified toilet paper purchases by Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s as two 12-rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) - has reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, not the severity of specific cases, the World Health Organization has drawn attention to the need for governments to take measures:
“All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “If countries detect and screen people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them for confrontation.
“We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and seriousness, as well as the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He stated in remarks published by CNN in February, “No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never before been hit by a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
“We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is being described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and acknowledged as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Basic treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining interpersonal distancing, monitoring, and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squamous anteaters, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person to show symptoms had the disease on 1 December 2019, and this person had no apparent contact with the market group.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning newspaper noted that a 55-year-old case dating back to November 17, 2019, from Hubei Province, was probably the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases in China were reported to have decreased, they suddenly rose in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, with the first cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases.
There may be significant under-reporting of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before effective herd immunity was administered.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and their infection has been confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies regarding not testing only for mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China as of 23 January, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Initial estimates of COVID-19 basic reproduction number (R0) ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from symptom deterioration to death is between 6 and 41 days, and the most common is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of February 5 are in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deaths who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without testing – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged that "we know that [the reported death toll] reflects an underestimation of reality," a statement backed up by narrative reports of inventory inaccuracy in the United States. This type of underestimation occurs in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and public health. The mortality/injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of casualty mortality have decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to case fatality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of those who have died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of those who have been confirmed to have died from the disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and follow a specific population group from the injury to the fate of the case.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infection mortality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analysing the effect of the test in case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massig Bonny of Pennsylvania State University said: “An outbreak of infectious diseases that are left unchecked usually peaks and then begins to decline when the disease does not find available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to reach any reasonable expectation now about the timing of that.”
China's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could be over by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will be widespread perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures “until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely—because it’s easily transmissible,” and may “become a seasonal disease—coming back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of the transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively indeterminate and symptoms may not appear on those infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, discharge of respiratory phlegm (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood inhaling, diarrhea, or glaucoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that approximately one in six people have severe difficulty with breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has limited emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, thinning of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. Exacerbation of the development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, pneumonia, and syndrome.
Some people with no clinical symptoms may not show symptoms but the results of the tests confirm their infection, so specialists have advised that people in contact with confirmed cases should be monitored and closely examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between the injury and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of a case of confusion, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30% and recently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still under investigation.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during mixing or through spray scattering when coughing, sneezing, or speaking at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth can result in a spray that spreads from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus may also be transmitted by long-term airborne spray, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce respiratory spray during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may release respiratory secretions in the form of a spray and then cause spread through the air.
It may also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from feces to the mouth, the risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 passing from feces to the mouth. The virus is more contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating the possibility of transmission before the onset of severe symptoms.
There are few reports of cases without laboratory-confirmed symptoms, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three others overall. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. The infection of pets and other animals with COVID-19 has been confirmed.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, yet British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, such as when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel one, isolated for the first time from three people who were suffering from pneumonia in contact with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its properties with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, melting its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically congruent with the genus of the beta coronavirus, and falls under the subspecies of the SARP virus (B strain) in addition to two bat-derived strains.
96% of the entire genome is identical to other samples of coronaviruses in bats (Pat Cove Rat G13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between squamous anteater viruses and human-derived viruses.
Comparing the entire genome so far has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% of the genetic material shared between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the parasite is the intermediate host of the virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography (CT) has suggested that computed tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, though less accurate, with many of its imaging characteristics being interwoven with pneumonia and other stages of disease.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "Computerized tomography should not be used to detect COVID-19 or be considered as an initial screening to diagnose the disease."
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several protocols for testing RNA for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done with a nasal pharyngeal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them has been proven accurate enough to be widely used.
A serological test developed by SELEX has been approved for emergency use in the United States in accredited laboratories only.
The imaging properties of radiographic images and computed tomography (CT) imaging for people with asymmetric terminal opacities, such as the blurring of the stained glass and blurred crystalline leachate, include.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Imaging without a polymerase chain reaction is a limited-accuracy procedure for the detection of COVID-19 due to its interference with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of computed tomography of the chest and polymerase chain reaction and proved that although imaging is less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it is considered a screening tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect virus imaging properties in both radiographic and computed tomography images.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with unwashed hands with eyes, nose or mouth, and using a napkin when coughing or sneezing and then getting rid of it by throwing it directly in the trash.
Those who are infected are already advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing procedures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals don’t know where or how they got it. Health care providers who care for a potentially infected person are advised to use reasonable measures, mixing precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an effective way for health authorities to identify the source of the infection.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments to track has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
Many mobile apps are designed or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they come close to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, nose and gargle washing with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations have been working on a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recommended using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the stainless steel surface), including: ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5 %.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected of contracting COVID-19 or is confirmed to be infected in a facility such as an office or care centre, all premises such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either bend the elbow and place it in front of the mouth and nose or use a paper napkin and get rid of any wipes immediately.
Those who are likely to be infected are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when scattered by talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask of desire [people] to touch their faces can be reduced, which is a major source of infection if hands are not properly cleaned.” Those who care for people who are likely to get sick are recommended to use a mask.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made from cloth. China specifically recommended healthy people to use disposable medical masks, especially in case of contact with people (within 1 meter (3 feet) or less) directly.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out into public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask at the exit necessary, while also recommending that face masks be manufactured at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing the mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 outbreak is detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany either banned social gatherings for more than two people. The elderly and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems are at an increased risk of serious diseases and complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised them to "remain at home as much as possible in the Tif areas".
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during a pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of having it.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed self-quarantine or recommended it for all people living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued to those from the most vulnerable groups.
People who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widespread have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Outbreak control strategies are containment or curbing and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects in the health-care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Curbing requires tougher measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of primary breeding to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious diseases is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the flattening of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of stress for health services and saves more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask wearing and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screenings and local quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to those who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and criminalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing, not stopping, the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reflecting the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain health systems.
Curbing may be preferable but must be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in humans (or until a vaccine is available, if this occurs first), as transmission on the other hand rebounds rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids and resting may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some “traditional and home remedies” can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoVID-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care centers to provide for COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures as far as possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and beds available.
There are several theories as to where the first case (so-called patient zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly related to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale, which also sells live animals. One theory is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group infected with pneumonia for an unknown reason was observed on December 26th and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jishian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “coronavirus-like SARS.”
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Wen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia unknown to the health authorities in Wuhan were reported, prompting them to begin investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases almost doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during the Chinese New Year and Wuhan as a transportation hub and the junction point of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later released show that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, there were more than 1.61 million reported cases worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and 36,000 deaths.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National reactions included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders in place orders, or closures) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, have undergone one form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million people have undergone closures in the Philippines, and about 59 million people have undergone closures in the Philippines.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent one form of closure, a number that rose to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jishian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by an unknown cause on 26 December, and subsequently informed her hospital in Jianghan Bohan on 27 December.
An initial genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The World Health Organization was informed on the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party of China (CPC) general secretary Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
Described as the “biggest quarantine in human history,” a health collar was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, Lishanshan Hospital, to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Restrictions were imposed on travel in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movement has been tightened in several cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have experienced some form of restriction of exit. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from being "brought" to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one case was transmitted locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of the outbreak in China had declined.
Travel-related restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension of entry of visa or residence permit holders from March 28 onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and offered a cash incentive package for companies. The State Council declared a three-minute day of silence on April 4, at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government demanded families show respect online for physical distancing to avoid a repeat of the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Xinqiongji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of 9,336 church followers, reported symptoms. South Korea declared its highest alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented a program that was considered the largest and best-organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected as well as track their contacts and quarantine them.
Methods of screening included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, HIV testing on people inside their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 daily.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite not applying quarantine to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either demanding Moon's removal, alleging the government's mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries for help in testing the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Qom, with two people dying later in the day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued before the new Persian year of Nowruz.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the epicentre of the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iran’s cover-up over the extent of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases from Iran as of February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to temporarily release eligible prisoners.
I mentioned that there is a high risk of the virus spreading in indoor places such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials are due to die of the disease by March 17.
By 23 March, Iran was registering 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times what has been announced.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the state’s financial capacity to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an easing of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on 31 January, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree with a new law to contain the outbreak, including a quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “He will not be allowed in or out of the outbreak areas.
It has already been ordered to suspend work activities and sporting events in those areas.” On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including first-class football matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesiology, Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 pandemic-related deaths were reported.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, 128,948 cases had been confirmed, 15,887 deaths had been reported, and 21,815 recovered in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all people with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, with gatherings of more than two people banned and travel and activity outside the home restricted except for a ban.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most businesses, with the exception of “necessary” businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations, and garages, were ordered to close.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington by a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on entry for travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control — the U.S. government’s flagship public health institute — announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the start of the test, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor’s order was then required).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, The Associated Press reported: "Many people who have experienced symptoms and have a doctor's order waited hours or days for the test." After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a procedure quickly followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled the school on 3 March, and by mid-March, schools were closed across the country. On 6 March 2020, the United States was informed of the forecast regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by epidemiologists at Imperial College London.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.
Companies have imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Activities and sporting seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days, effective March 13.
The following day, the restrictions were extended to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced working hours across the United States in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases of coronavirus were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing appeared to be a success, with estimates showing cases slowing from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died of the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend the social distancing directive until April 30.
On the same day, USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
The Trump administration’s crisis was not universally applauded as it generated widespread polarization among the parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized U.S. dependence on imports of essential items, including essential medical supplies, from China.
Air travel pattern analysis was used to map and predict prevalence patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travellers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its COVID-19 emergency response plan on 7 February.
She said not much had yet been discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and that Australia would stress border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
As public transportation has been affected by effective quarantines in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with permits provided by Chinese authorities.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has said it will not evacuate any of its citizens from China.
On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members as well as four Poles, a Chinese person, and an Indian citizen.
Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked in Poland, where the Brazilian plane stopped before resuming its route to Brazil.
Brazilian citizens who went to Wuhan were isolated at a military base near Brasilia.
On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 of the first plane, 39 of the second plane chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan to Trenton for two weeks.
On 11 February, another plane carrying 185 Canadians from Wuhan landed at Canadian Forces Base Trenton.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on 3 and 4 February to the Christmas Island Detention Centre, which was repurposed as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on 5 February, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were quarantined at a naval base in Wangabarawa, northern Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate the Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On 21 February, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African airliner chartered by the South African government repatriated 112 South Africans.
A pre-departure medical check-up was carried out, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left to mitigate the risks.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
The test results proved that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a precautionary measure, remained under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch resort for 14 days, were uninjured.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad, Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) sent aid to China.
A joint group in the greater Chicago area was reportedly able to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. Humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent by 200,000 face masks with other emergency personal protective equipment, including gloves and staff clothing, to June Hospitals.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, as well as to protect “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”
Intraxion reported that the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan donated one million face masks to Luhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany delivered several medical supplies, including 10,000 protective suits, and the United States donated another 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they were distributed by the African Union.
He later sent to Panama 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five respirators.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 of China-made coronavirus test kits that were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 of China-made face masks that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were in fact from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed Chinese aid well received. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of obfuscation that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided “regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.”
On 23 January 2009, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the ban on transportation in Wuhan, the WHO representative Guden Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is highly concentrated", and described it as "unprecedented increase in the history of public health", the WHO's other countries declared it in January 30, and after confirming the transition.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that considering the outbreak as a public health emergency is of international concern due to “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility.”
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems in place to detect people living with HIV, even if it appears.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest among us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later". On 11 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease, at a press conference, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to offer “the potential of the entire UN system in response.”
As a result, a UN crisis management team has been set up, which has allowed the coordination of the entire UN response, and WHO will allow it to “focus on health response while other agencies’ expertise can be leveraged to see the wider social, economic, and development impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was set up to provide international experts and experts from WHO on the ground in China to assist in local management and assess the "severity of the disease and its transmissibility" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and city level" and to assess the "possible" status of WHO, including urban and rural areas.
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", which is its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a real test for every government on the planet: so we have to be prepared.
“This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it,” he said, urging the right response measures that could help the world avoid “what’s worse.”
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease as a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means “we fundamentally accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO is “deeply concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO has faced strong criticism for what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency, and the categorization of the virus as a pandemic.
The violent reactions included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts confirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons belonging to minorities, the elderly, the internally displaced, the homeless, those living in very poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a state policy tracker, which aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Edward Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several Communist Party of China (CPC) directors have been dismissed on a cross-sectoral level over their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China (CPC) general secretary Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected an earlier admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying China "has imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic", which some critics have criticized for being racist and "distracted" from his administration's failure to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable reviewing the communications blueprint with clear sources at the National Security Council, stating with a strategy that “it’s all about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was “a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generous policies.”
Borrell also said that “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
US sanctions have banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid that was destined for other countries to their home countries.
There have been mask-related disputes reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Masari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “China has responded only bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military medics, special clearance vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of initiating a “geographical and diplomatic” attack.
The president of Lombardy, Atilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to return the favor if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Cannon 2020” military exercises will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO wargame since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 Defenders’ training, saying: “In the current public health crisis, the training not only endangers the lives of troops from the United States and many of the participating European countries but also the populations of the countries in which it will be conducted.” The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament plus fifteen other former or current political figures infected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal childcare, public paid family leave, and higher levels of funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's removal because they claimed the government had mishandled the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic allowed states to pass emergency legislation under the response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this may allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for many supply shortages due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier shutdowns.
Many areas have also seen panic buying, which has left shelves empty of basic grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand has driven up prices by up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
Activity led to shortages of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both regions survived acute food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trafficking of vital products have succeeded in averting the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy’s large agricultural output has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives’ expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been noted that the outbreak of the virus poses a significant threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha DeMaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the epidemic’s economic implications for global growth could exceed those of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a “disruption” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets slumped on Feb. 24 due to a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard <0x26> Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest single-day decline since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indicators ended the week down more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoop Ratings confirmed GMBH's sovereign credit rating for China, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest decline being on March 16.
Many believe that economic stagnation is possible.
Economist Mohammed Al-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and states in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they did under the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public spaces including tourist attractions, and a warning to governments not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Kants, while the British regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events featuring large crowds, including New Year’s Eve celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60%.
This also led to a drop of between 33 and 43% in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and eliminating events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than they would otherwise be without.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak may cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate in 2020 may reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The closure in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed since March. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that nearly 90% of the Canadian workers have been unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into short-term government-subsidised work plans known as Corsarbet.
France and Britain adopted the German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals – workers and independents – globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector have sought to support its mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, keep its employees and the public safe, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events, shows, and exhibitions had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerating consequences of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a hiatus. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian season of Lent.
Many Christian dioceses have recommended that elderly people stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live web or television, while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square vacated from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and the Gordoara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Europa League, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021".
This has led many gamblers to switch to playing online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as those on Broadway have suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet as much has turned to humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, severe prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports released in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world toward the Chinese that they deserve the virus or receive what is alleged to be justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak has spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to pressure to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is coming out.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and US have reported increasing levels of racist abuse, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism over the reference to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term that critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China and is studying in major Indian cities, have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the statements, calling them “wrong.” In China, the pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being described as “foreign garbage” and targeted for “disposal.”
Many newspapers have removed subscription-paid pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.
Emerging infectious diseases – infectious diseases are often emerging pathogens, emerging in terms of their scope of outbreak or mode of transmission.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes ways to detect the presence of the virus as it identifies antibodies produced in response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases of infection.
Antibody detection (serology) is used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have developed the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to be reported or who have not shown symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant discrepancy in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to have a significant impact on reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcriptional instantaneous polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) the examination can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a nasal pharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR, which is administered with throat swabs, is not used until the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken by suction catheter or a cough substance (sputum).
One of the earliest PCR tests at the Charite in Berlin was introduced in January 2020 using reverse transcription real-time polymerase reaction (RT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created a PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit for SARS-CoV-2 suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval for emergency use from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for SARS-CoV-2 detection kits based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic panel.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and one of the test phases was delayed from the others at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples per day being successfully tested on average throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and until then, state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under the Emergency Use Authorization. Commercial Laboratories in the United States began conducting the tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of COVID-19 testing across the country based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research created and produced the COVID-19 test.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Service for Healthcare Supervision recorded the test. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 24 hours of testing.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Holologic, Lab Corp. and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Seifed received a similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that took about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses isothermal DNA amplification technology instead of BCR.
Since this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically linked to the nuclear capsid protein (NPR) of the novel coronavirus, hoping to be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that “chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [CT scan] results may be apparent even before symptoms appear.”
Typical characteristics that appear in computed tomography include double-sided multi-lobed scaffolding glass obtrusions with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
The spread develops under the pleura and irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to computed tomography with respect to the origin of the current pandemic suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging characteristics interfacing with cases of pneumonia and other stages of disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "Computerized tomography should not be used to detect COVID-19 or be considered an initial screening to diagnose the disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommends using BCR for the initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals within a period of 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population surveillance. The tests can be performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or by a clinical care point (BOCT) test.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For a clinical point-of-care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn through a skin puncture.
Unlike BCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be performed prior to screening. On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that had notified the agency in accordance with the requirements and were able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under the Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditation for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional BCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the infection started. In April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits they bought were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients who are suspected of being infected can stay home. The emergency department gives the car a sample tube, spits into the tube, and returns it to get the test result after a short period. The NHS has announced that it is testing a plan to test the suspected cases at home, ruling out the risk of transmission.
In-vehicle testing centers have enabled South Korea to conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests globally. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it was able to conduct about 12,000 outpatient tests daily and 10,700 people underwent testing last week.
Health insurance costs are borne if a doctor orders the test.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car virus detection tests were made available in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive case results were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that, starting with the most recent B/A study, <0xC2><0xA3>5.000 and <0xC2><0xA3>5.000 were tested by the end of the week, <0xC2><0xA3>483,295 and <0xC2><0xA3>33.491 (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method of testing <0xC2><0xA3>64.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and 5 days into it, modeling operations showed that cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been completed.
Wuhan Lab immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in 12 cities in total throughout China.
By 4 March 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open-source, multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 samples for a patient to detect COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, the lack and inadequacy of reagents caused a dilemma when conducting a large number of tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that included heating the samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to edit the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was at the top of the world in terms of the proportion of its population taking the coronavirus test, and is on the way to raising the level of the test procedure to reach the level of the population.
This was through a combination of in-vehicle test capability activation, and the purchase of a high-throughput, population-friendly lab from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection labs in China).
Established in 14 days, the lab allows tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world’s first lab of this size to operate outside of China.
Different methods of testing targeting different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan for the manufacturing of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own kits.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, leading to delays in testing available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and follow the test recommendations.
Experts said the abundance of tests in South Korea helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for intensified testing programs as the optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in U.S. private laboratories, as the supply of scanners and chemical reagents became scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, there were “defects” in the test kits created by CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that specifically prevented testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or not using the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry has stated that it will step back from buying kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed throwing it into the Danube. Professor A<0xC4><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits purchased by Turkey from China have a "high error rate" and have "forbidden use". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by quarantine for those diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vu, which saw its first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Almost half of the people who tested positive showed no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, the new infections were completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decline in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments, through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events were cancelled, and Singapore had already begun urging residents to stay indoors on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on time after the holiday.
Several other countries have also brought the pandemic under control through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closures, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have tested more, compared to deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect only those with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity or local laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send the first five positive and first 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following diagram, the column “% positive of tests” is influenced by the policy of the state in conducting the test.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospital will have a percentage higher positive case rate than a country that tests its entire population, whether they show symptoms or not, on an equal basis with other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand-washing with soap at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s butt or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry, and after.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper for a baby or cleaning it after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, their feed, or their droppings.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases causing diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reducing infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing from bouts of diarrhea can be reduced by nearly a third, which is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of low diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when automatic behavior is applied in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the death of about 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
A simple harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of flaking and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the toilet (urinating, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand-washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is decreasing.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent, the United States is closer to the middle by 77 percent, and in China, the lowest by 23 percent. There are now many behavioral change methodologies available to increase the benefit of handwashing behavior for children with soap at necessary times.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
The treatment of worms twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to the water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstructions of dissolution, increasing solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective antiseptic for the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily decompose in water.
However, the proper amount of water helps to cleanse.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have noted bacterial transmission of contaminated hard soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because bacteria are washed off with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to state that “liquid soap is preferable to touch-free devices for pumping soap.”
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted for health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is being selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap doesn’t affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed for.
Besides its surfactant and skin protection agent, its sophisticated formulations may contain ascorbic acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a regulator of acid, benzoic acid active antimicrobial and other skin moisturizers (aloe sativa, vitamins, menthol, extracts, etc.) as well as as as phytosanitary assays.
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap at removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a material that is not water-based for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand sanitizers and scrubbers (also known as hand washes with alcohol composition, disinfectant hand washes or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with at least 60-95% alcohol are effectively bactericidal.
Cross-rub alcohol sterilizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant intestinal components), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus, nasal viruses, sepsis, influenza, and hepatitis),
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% alcohol through rubbing eliminate 99.97% (a logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to a dB decrease of 35) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands against some bacteria 1 minute after application.
Alcohol hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against Norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. Enough hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
Finger tips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with a hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and their rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless water and soap are available.
Frequent use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless you add raindrops, moisturizers, or both to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol or other emollients or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contactory urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcoholic hand lotions are rare.
The reduced susceptibility to the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis has become an attractive factor compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse the hands of organic substances, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sterilizer depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and historically has had a markedly lower impact than that of an alcohol-based hand sterilizer.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to gradual skin adverse reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities can’t afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with microorganisms they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also an antiseptic because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes the rubbing for longer periods of time more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinseing the hands inside the pelvis may cause them to re-contaminated.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are again easily contaminated. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, and dry skin can damage it, which can increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap, or both are not available, such as pouring water from a hanging bowl or perforating appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as "other taps" and "low taps".
Tipi tap is a simple technique that uses a teapot suspended by a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research indicates that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium for the manufacture of paper towels, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and newer jet air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the soles of the fingers by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average on the soles of the fingers decreased by up to 76% and on the palms by 77%, and the scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there is a possibility of transmission to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of inflating microorganisms from the hands and device, and may transmit the infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer deploys microorganisms at a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative while traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Agnates Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found low rates of infection using them.
Medical hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using copious amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers tangled.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a brush with coarse hair can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“bacteria”) and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that not washing hands remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, which transports microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a paper outlining how to wash and rub hands in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document submitted by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization has five “moments” for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Prior to the sterilisation mission, and
After taking care of patients. Adding disinfectant chemicals to the soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") adds a pesticide element to the hand washing agent.
This extermination element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most prevalent. When "rubbing" someone's hands for surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washes, other sterile towels for hand-drying and scrubbing, after washing
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
The long duration of the rub (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from returning from the forearms to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of manual disinfection was found to come from the first 20% of washing, and it gained a very small additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to over 35%.
Washing with regular soap leads to more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases that are transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Compared with an alcohol solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and hard-to-hand spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and oral reminders for employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, it is recognized that hand washing with soap is an essential tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can be caused by ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing, and change people’s behavior in the long run.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “three-star approach” designed to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to eventually three.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns being conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are trying to achieve behavior change. Due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing to human health—especially for people in critical conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Agnes Semmelweis who worked in Vienna in Austria, and English nurse Florence Nightingale.
Most people at the time still believed the infection was due to the unpleasant odors called miazmaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more effective hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing “right ways to wash hands” were hung next to hand-washing basins in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands of" means something to declare one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or to participate in complicity in it.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a piece of fiction that represents her guilt for the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after pointing out or thinking about unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate hand washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleansing” compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions describe washing hands for both healthy and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the rituals of hand washing that have appeared in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hinduism, Tefillah, hand washing in Judaism, and specific washings in Christianity and Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Control of COVID-19 Risks in the Workplace
Workplace COVID-19 risk control controls are the application of occupational safety and health risk control methodologies to prevent COVID-19 disease.
Proper workplace risk control controls depend on the workplace and function, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), businesses with low exposure risks involve minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a condition in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneezing etiquette, and maintaining hygiene practices.
Posts with moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have come into contact with the general public such as in schools, high-labour-intensive work environments, and some large-scale retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers and mortuaries exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, collect samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 person or deal with them.
Appropriate risk control controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of goods required, and the ways to obtain them (such as shopping in off-peak hours or via delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from the heavily affected geographic areas of COVID-19 may be stopped. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at highest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Since the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution for implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, correct fit as appropriate (e.g. respirators), wear continuously and correctly, regularly inspect, maintain and replace, as necessary, remove, clean, store, or dispose properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less exposure to risk involve minimal contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observing coughing and sneezing etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue paper and garbage disposals, cleaning equipment, and preparing to work remotely or organize shifts.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illnesses remain at home until fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without using antipyretic or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, and that employees be allowed to stay at home as a family member.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, middle-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected of COVID-19, but who may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the community around the workplace, or due to a person's recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is common.
In addition to the workers' and workers' work, the workers' labor and labor, the workers' labor and labor, the workers' labor and labor, the workers' labor and labor-intensive work environments, and some of the labor-intensive retail places. The workers' labor and labor-intensive groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing protections, and the installation of the workers' labor-intensive work.
People working in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on an aircraft, appropriate prevention controls to protect other workers and passengers include keeping the sick passenger 6 feet away from others, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Crews should wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the passenger is experiencing a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in the biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical center on board if a person is infected with a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is a limit to transmission in the community ranging from limited to average, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band lessons, or snacking in the cafeteria, increasing office distances, regulating attendance times and sequential departures, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children who suffer.
When there is significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school leave dates can be taken into account. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, the direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and tools before reusing them with a household cleaning spray or mop, and follow standard work procedures to deal with contamination, dispose of used personal protective equipment, and collect and wash clothes.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, some health care and mortuary workers fall into categories with high or very high levels of risk.
High-risk jobs include health care providers, support, laboratories, and medical transport who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high-risk if personnel perform aerosol generation procedures, as well as collecting samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients or dealing with them.
Procedures for aerosol generation include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The functions of a high-risk mortuary include personnel involved in preparing the bodies of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 subjects at the time of their death; they are at very high risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation chambers for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when performing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples must be handled following level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating patients arriving in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform the procedure.
In the United States, N95 respirators, certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes composition and suitability testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort level of workers. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, because COVID-19 is a respiratory illness rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of a surgical mask for examination staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any procedures to generate aerosols, the World Health Organization recommends the use of a surgical mask, goggles, face shield, and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, a face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 breathing mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends that individuals be advised to reduce the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those in direct care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, and continue to use the same respiratory mask without removing it during the care of many.

We found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a clear demonstration of global human interdependence and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on the kind of global empathy, collaboration, and community building that are at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human emotions that surround, fortunately, the way we do business.
I am very grateful and deeply proud that you are true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism that this crucial resource remains available online and a kiss for everyone.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s through the continued operation of the sites, our colleagues getting paid, or providing safety for our communities.
The world is in dire need of the information available on Wikipedia more than ever before.
It’s a moment when the positive impact in the world is not just on our efforts, but how we do them.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the working method and schedules
As Rubin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought could be the right response to what we’re facing, and the perfect way to maintain the sustainability of the organization’s work during this period.
We wanted with great enthusiasm to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce your workload, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We’re not advertising a vacation, so if you’re able to work longer than your normal working hours, you might add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
Allowing this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it as an affirmation.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor makes a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian in the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can help by providing support and making sure your condition is properly cared for by the Department.)
Hourly fellows are paid in full.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will be paid on the basis of normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many individuals are taking advantage of work to overcome the pressures that are rampant in the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of yourself.
We only ask you to communicate with your manager so that he or she knows what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, trust, fundraising (and others) are doing a critical job, which may need further support.
We will start a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work to be done by all of us, and we’ll focus on only the most important projects.
Going slower now, won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double down on work time to catch up” after the pandemic ends.
We are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to establish new goals and timetables as and when appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while aligning those who need or want to work within a reduced work schedule over the next few weeks.
This schedule extension eases the workload of current planning and pressure across the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for their leading role in this matter.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a virus-resistant, hospital-grade solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the hallway and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty of care protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable because the office is conveniently ready until the time we decide to go back to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C. is located in a building belonging to WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all members of our staff at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our office in Washington, D.C. moved to a completely remote location under the joint direction of our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know that it may be an adjustment, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared, and reading materials sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, with one person monitoring the conversation to find out questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to help take notes (or carry out a collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when convenient headphones are needed.
The health and safety compensation program can be used to get the cost of snacks.
You can join the <0x23>remoties channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking for a user-friendly, online meeting-based guidance to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of online editors Editathon, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We have told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these targets.
Next week we will release additional follow-up guidance related to Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiments of the global community flounder between sadness over disruption, relief over clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
Going forward with these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all communications with it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the working group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating with each other.
We share this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary information regarding COVID-19 available at Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages updated and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with personnel residing in the most severely affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to let us know and cooperate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Brian Gooden, Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
Any such change shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the work entrusted to us or of the obligations incumbent upon us.
Instead, it is a realization in this present moment that our work and commitments are in a preponderant need to adapt in a way that we have not seen in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our people with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work that we have planned to achieve will be waiting for us when the time comes to complete it.
Now, it is time to help each other and create a space for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We all need you to make this happen, so we all need you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when the time comes for your efforts to be needed.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Kathryn, Crisis Response Team Manager (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janine U, Lisa E., and Robb S).
ACE2 binds to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, and kidney, as well as the intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the action of ACE by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 enzyme is a metal enzyme that contains the element zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme protein has an M2-spectrum peptidease that has an amino end, and a carboxylic colictrine chain of a renal amino acid transporter.
Angiotensin 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein that has active enzymatic receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular part of the angiotensin II enzyme is separated from the transmembrane by an enzyme called chydase, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then excreted via the urine.
Angiotensin-2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, and in the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
RNA is present in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The primary function of angiotensin II enzyme is to act as a counterbalance of angiotensin II enzyme.
The angiotensin converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin-1 to angiotensin-2 astringent blood vessels.
In contrast, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 separates the amino acid carboxylene-phenylenediamine-containing alanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylene-parathenine) and converts it into angiotensin-1.
Angiotensin-2 is broken down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9]-bradrikinin, abelin, neurotinsin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
Angiotensin 2 enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral neutral transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartenb's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry into cells for some coronaviruses, which include the human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS infection), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein with the ACE2 enzyme range on the cell surface leads to cellular uptake and transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the formation of the S protein by the transmembrane protease enzyme, host serine2, which is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some hypothesized that lowering levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend the continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a marked reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia was reduced among patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors led to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant angiotensin II enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injury, as it has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute dyspnea syndrome induced by polysaccharides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin II enzyme is about 10 hours, it starts to work after 30 minutes, and it continues to be effective (time period) up to 24 hours.
There is ample evidence that recombinant angiotensin II enzyme stenosis may be a promising treatment for those who suffer from intolerance to traditional angiotensin II resonant system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases associated with elevated angiotensin II blood. There are clinical trials under evaluation for the effect of angiotensin II enzyme reuptake therapy in angiotensin II.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices specifically designed to help track people in contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications for contact tracing.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on geolocation tracking for app users.
Less invasive alternatives to privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they might integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they have come into contact with people with COVID-19.
It is an app used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
The app was designed by a local IT association, released as an open source app and is to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting Apple's Google Play and App Store approval.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracing app was in advanced development and could become available for distribution within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing applications based on the TraceTogether application launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Trace protocol.Russia intends to introduce an application that uses the geographical virtual environment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow residents, and is designed to make sure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if applications are limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their coronavirus-related apps to its app store, limiting this to only “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly with regard to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will go away once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Monitoring and monitoring extensions should include provisions for determining when to stop them;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
Data security and confidentiality should be protected and evidence-based protection should be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing the intensity of discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined by law;
There should be protections against abuse and the protection of citizens’ rights to address abuses;
"Effective participation" from all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to primary location data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been established that use centralized servers for interconnects only (see the following section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing operations.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and includes this data to send notifications via text message to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available as well, which it has allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details about this have yet to be released.
Privacy-preserved contact tracing is a successful concept and is supported by strong research literature dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-compliant solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (PLE) to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-BPT was a coordination effort with both centralized and decentralized approaches, and not an individual protocol. The decentralized protocols include privacy-preserved decentralized approach tracking (DPPPT/DBT-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN) and contact numbers (formerly known as CIN numbers).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab was developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or cross-tracking to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report “The Wicked Face of Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Shadow of the Epidemic.” Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy-related technologies that also originally originated at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature to achieve widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the Blue Trace protocol, which is used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track contacts; they claimed that they would maintain privacy based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three stages:
Introducing tools to enable governments to create official, privacy-preserving apps to track coronavirus
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to resolve persistent usage and monitoring issues by first distributing systems via OS updates and then removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
A drug repositioning (also known as re-use, re-allocation, goal change, or therapeutic transformation of a drug) is a redefinition of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally designed to treat.
This is a scientific research method that researchers are currently using to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transport of vector plasma.The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these association sites provides a reasonable plan regarding the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the critical SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are door-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicase, S protein, and ribophosphatase for diphosphate adenosine.
Husain A. A., et al. studied several candidate compounds that then underwent optimization and analysis for their structure similarity to approved drugs with higher similarity and this with the purpose of accelerating the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York state trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EEA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and was licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental treatment for emergency use to treat patients who were hospitalized but could not access treatment in a clinical trial.
CDC announced that "the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, doses or period has yet to be determined".
Doctors said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are taking place at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The Langone Medical School of New York University is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative at an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half received omefenavir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating the most severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to become pregnant.
One study that used Lupinavir/Ritonavir (Calitra), a combination of the antiviral combination of Lupinavir and Ritonavir, reported that the results "did not show any benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to access a compound associated with SARS-CoV-2.The scientific community is witnessing a case of criticism about resource redirection to repurpose drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lubenavir/Ritonavir to the international solidarity experience.
Gilead Sciences has developed Remediciphere as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has subsequently discovered that Remediciphere has antiviral activity in the laboratory against many nematode viruses, mucosal viruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiretroviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Rimdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by University of Cleveland Hospitals: one for people with mesothelioma, and the other for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients suffering from acute illness due to COVID-19, as well as two controlled trials using placebo (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).

Japan’s National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin’s Alfesco (Sicklesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A Phase II trial is currently underway using a form of ACE2-transducer in 200 patients required to join the trial from acute cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multi-center study in Italy of 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin at doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses was announced on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, there has been considerable scientific attention focused on reusing approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: The specialists recommended the use of Ribavirin to treat COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese directives

Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tocilizumab (interleukin antagonist receptor 6): Certified by China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumptive vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiative for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have advanced to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA) (developer of phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (developer of phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milkin Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I and II trials perform an initial, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site, safety and immunosuppression test with more accurate and effective dosing.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine efficacy test to prevent the disease, while observing the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Haniki Schweitzer, announced that they had begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer with the novel antigen vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had started a vaccine project to synthesize the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical and Materiel Research Command at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and a Phase 1 clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the acceleration of the pace of work it would take at least one and a half to almost two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was developing a particle similar to the coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with plans for testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “significant sums of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on RNA.
The RNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive preclinical test results in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine could begin testing in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, driving the total US$29 million investment of the Alliance for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
The partners of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to Develop the COVID-19 Vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing in animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-inflated ribosome DNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical measures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced CAD 192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "microneedle-administered SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines elicited strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that were evident after 2 weeks."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on deoxyribonucleic acid as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the deoxyribonucleic acid will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called indeterminate effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines that are being developed are likely to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as angiotensin II-converting enzyme-modified mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Anti-SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When March spread, it was believed that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the Mars-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on RNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were under development, all of which were virus-directed vaccines, and two adenovirus-directed vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, and BVRS-AVAM).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory claiming that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and that the vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April, more than 2.24 million people in 210 countries and territories were reported infected, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between people during mixing, often through sprays dispersed when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When the spray is dispersed during exhalation, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the chain polymerase reaction of instantaneous reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) through a nasal pharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some seeing otherwise, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if you develop emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or blue face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases showed no symptoms during her hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in the daily toll on April 1; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) had asymptomatic cases at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Talking out loud results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth could lead to a spray splashing up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bioaerosols, and testing samples from air collectors in the lobby outside of individuals' rooms has yielded positive viral RNA results.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may release respiratory secretions in the form of a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the stool, the risk is thought to be limited.The virus is more contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three others overall. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to remain on cardboard for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper (99%).
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and antiseptics are also effective provided they are used correctly; soap dissolves the virus’s protective adipose membrane and stops it from working, as well as ridding the skin and other surfaces of the virus.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical antiseptic), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the acute respiratory illness cluster in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin II enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in type 2 alveolar cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycemic protein called "spike" (volume split) to communicate with ACA2 and enter the host cell.
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, suffered severe heart attacks, and were more common in critical cases.
Rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACA2 receptors in the heart.
ACA2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
The rate of strokes (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 has increased, which may be related to poor prediction of the outcome of the disease. When dissecting the bodies of individuals who have died from COVID-19, diffuse synovial damage (DAD) and inflammatory lesion containing cells have been found.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards the epithelial cells that express ACA2 in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete disease-causing GM-CSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in the only cells that secrete inflammation-causing interleukin 6 and rampant lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic lesion was also reported at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal pharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples need to be taken two weeks apart and the results are of little direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Opacities of bifocal, multi-lobed glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior spread are common features at the onset of injury.
A subsident spread may appear and form a stone aligner (thickness of the lobule with uneven shingles) and merge with the development of the disease.
Little data is available on the microplastics and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions of autopsy:
Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary hyperplasia and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: Pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pulmonary cells, abnormally large alveolar cells, peritoneal inflammation with lymphatic lesion and formation of giant multi-core cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse synovial damage (DAD) with diffuse synovial discharge.
Diffuse alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffused intravascular clotting (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the facility if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to thoroughly clean the hands after any cough or sneezing.
CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to reduce the transmission of asymptomatic infections.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings.
Spacing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021 at the earliest, the key part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not available only. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity arises in these two combinations of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is “not an effective hand sanitizer.”
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive therapies may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Intensive care professionals and pulmonary specialists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from diverse bodies in a free resource, the online Critical Care Book.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual respiration.
For healthcare professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation room from an airborne infection (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions. CDC explains guidelines for the use of PPE.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment aprons, a respirator or face mask, eye protectors, and medical gloves. It is preferable to use respirators (rather than face masks) as soon as they are available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or home-made masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require artificial respiration or replacements, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for those in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using high-flow nasal cannula or positive bilevel airway pressure.
It is not known whether either option would be of equal benefit to those with a critical illness.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas ventilator when available as this technique reduces the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.Critical cases are more frequent in older people (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden rise in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required industrial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those hospitalized for COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Synthetic breathing becomes more complicated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure-control modes and elevated positive expiratory pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory-associated lung injury and thoracic pneumothorax.
High positive expiratory pressure may not be available in old respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Rimdesefer seems to be the most proselytizing.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescence plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The application is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track the injured and those they have intermingled with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect those who might come into contact with injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the location data of the collected phones with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for the purposes of research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Giulio Galera, Italy’s regional health commissioner, said mobile phone companies had told him that “40 percent of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend in which more than 42,000 people participated.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Kaljulaid, also presented a global call to showcase innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of injury itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic stagnation is a storm that is damaging people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild course with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital were diagnosed with an abnormality of blood clotting, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% had kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen elevated levels of liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, for those transferred to the intensive care unit, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the overall incidence ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological anatomical examinations of post-mortem lung samples show widespread spinal damage with cellular fibromexide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths announced by China’s National Health Commission.
According to data released by the U.S. in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of deaths due to the condition vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused deaths may suggest that the current death rate is less than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to die from intensive care than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some of those recovering from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage.
It may also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not previous infections confer effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunisation is seen as possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it has been announced that there have been recoveries from COVID-19 and later re-infection.
It is believed that these conditions worsen if the infection persists than when it recurs.
The virus is believed to be natural and to have an animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019, is the first date of symptoms.
Official publications of the World Health Organization (WHO) have reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date of symptoms.
Numerous measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) assigned within the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases Emergency Code U 07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and U 07.2 to COVID-19-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths clinically or epidemiologically during the period without laboratory-confirmed cases.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global casualty mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which expresses the percentage of those who have been diagnosed and have died of disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which expresses the percentage of those who have been diagnosed and those who have not been diagnosed) and those who have died of disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from the injury to the fate of the case.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected people, their presence may provide information about the number of infected people.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castellione di Ada, a small village with a population of 4,600, is already dying 80 people (1.7%).
In Ganglet, the disease spread to young people, causing a relatively lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, perhaps about 3% have antibodies, according to an evaluation conducted on blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years, with the difference between men and women disappearing at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Immunologic differences based on gender, non-prevalence of smoking among women and men with concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of HIV infection.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that Ko is short for coronavirus, and in short for virus, Ko is short for disease and 19 refers to the year of discovery of the outbreak for the first time: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with the international recommendations of the label aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the WHO uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public statements.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the names novel coronavirus-2019 and acute respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines prohibiting the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reverse engineered it and released the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation regarding the origin of the disease, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no medications or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the “Solidarity Trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACA2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the micro-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain micro-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spike S protein that helps the virus break into the receptors of the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent adhesion has been cited as a potential challenge to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved treatments for malaria have been evaluated, including four studies related to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed for re-use in the treatment of the new disease make up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on Rimdesivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs has been conducted as of April 2020.Several existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupenavir/ritonavir, and lupenavir/tonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence of Remediciphere’s effectiveness, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with the drug Rimdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute points out that although a dose of one gram is recommended, the weakness of this dose is very serious and may cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued a license for emergency use of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians for COVID-19 sufferers.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory.
A further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms has been recommended after demonstrating inhibition of low concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial formation of spike protein via TMPRS2 is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir SARS-CoV-2 is not inhibited in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.The National Health Commission of China added to the guidelines for treatment after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe conditions.
In addition to being used in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it is intended to counteract such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some people.
The FDA approved Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, based on retrospective case studies to treat cytokine release syndrome of non-steroid responders with a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no well-controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The mode of transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by COVID-19-recovery immune systems to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can act as a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, macrophage or both, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of varicose veins, which are made up of the liquid part of the recovered patients’ blood and contain antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster dissemination.
Diseases of coronaviruses, a set of closely related syndromes
Lee Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently infected and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
