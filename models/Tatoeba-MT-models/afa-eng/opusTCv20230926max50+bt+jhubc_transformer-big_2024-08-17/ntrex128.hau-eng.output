The Welsh AMs are worried about 'how to be stupid'
There is a fear of danger among some AMs on the recommendation to change their position to MWPs (Member of the Welsh National Assembly).
It arose because of plans to change the name of the convention to the Welsh National Assembly.
In fact, it's a political issue that can lead to a lot of ridicule.
An AM of the Labour Party said the party was "worried by Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means madness and pwp means bone.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole "didn't like it" and recommended options.
A Welsh commentator said the group "had nothing in mind" about changing the name, but noted a brief explanation from MWP to Muppet.
In this dictionary, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the Yorshire English word equivalent of the u letter.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to introduce the name changes, said: "The final ruling on any manifesto of what is called members of the House will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on the resolutions of those who had received broad support for calling for the Welsh National Assembly.
On the subject of the name of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the choice of the MWP received the most support in a public debate.
The AMs are apparently proposing some options, but the fight to get to the bottom of the impasse can be tough for the Superintendent, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft the bill over the changes in a matter of weeks.
The act on the changes will include other changes to the functioning of the House, including regulations on the definition of the incapacity of AMs and the structure of the committee.
AMs will get the final vote on the issue of what to call it when they debate the law.
Macedonian citizens went to vote in the referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set for an attempt to resolve a year-on-year conflict with neighboring Greece, whose province is called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbor from the north represents a bulwark over its territory and has repeatedly refused to seek membership in the European Union and NATO's Non-Aligned Movement.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal opponent of the direct voting process over the name change, has said he will reject the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of an employee is a necessary step in order to join the European Union and NATO's Non-Aligned Movement.
St. Martin's Cathedral Remains Silent Because Churches in Harlem Are in Trouble
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"There is no one today."
He said that the loss was understandable.
"People are enjoying themselves in a different way" on these days, his engine.
"It's no longer a place where people come to live."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money generated from the sale of the property would not be long enough if, as the leaders had expected, "sooner or later they would be back if they started."
He added that churches and apartment buildings would be replaced with large areas full of people who would not be helpful to other places of refuge of the neighbors.
"The majority of the people who will buy large areas in these buildings will be white," he said, "so they will hasten the day when these churches will be said to have closed completely because it is likely that most of these people who moved into these large areas will become members of these churches."
It was built by both white churches before Harlem became a black town - the community in the Village in 1870, a decade after St. Martin's.
The origins of the white supremacist movement emerged in the 1930s.
The building was occupied by a large gathering of local worshippers.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black cult under John Howard Johnson, who led merchants to move out and buy goods on line 125, a high-end shopping line in Harlem, which was committed to hiring black workers or supporting blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Fada Johnson's followers made plans to rebuild it, they opened up the musical instruments of the church.
David Johnson, the son of David Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the church's musical instruments "the latest generation of ordinary people."
His short essay in July called it something else: "A traditional treasure trove" and "an irreplaceable treasure trove."
The composer, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first musical instrument in the world sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved a large piece of music to Riverside Hall 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said the St. Martin's had not replaced it.
What appeared in St. Martin's a few months ago became a disorienting tale of designers and contractors, some brought by uneducated church leaders, and others by the power of a chief episcopal priest.
Then the vestry committee - the board of the church's border area, which includes uneducated leaders - wrote to the chief priest in July and their deputies that the church's border area would "request a handover of the money spent" to the vestry committee, although the vestry committee could not be hired and the auditors could not be hired.
Some followers complained about the lack of explanation of what was done by the part of the church's border area.
13-year-old shark injured in California's search for 13-year-old lobster
A large sea fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while hunting for a lobster in California on the open day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the shore of the Beacon Sea in the Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming at him and that was when he headed there with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hamel said at first that it took an annuity to catch a losbter, but that was it: "He knew that he was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I've been licked!"
His shoulder is completely open," says Hammel, whom he saw when he arrived at the boy's place.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water. Hammel added, ‘There’s a big fish in the water!’
The boy was taken on a plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed in critical condition.
It is not known what species of large-scale sea fish carried out the attack.
Captain Larry Giles in charge of life said in front of reporters that a large sea fish had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not from another species that it was a large dangerous fish.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries on the upper part of the bed behind him.
Officials closed off the coast from the Ponto Coast in Casablanca to Swami's in the Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and protection purposes.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of large-scale sea fish in the area, but most are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's is preparing to enter the UK's stock market
Sainsbury's carries Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar parts of the fashion store that are considered to be staffed by professional aid providers.
As part of its participation in the UK's 2.8 billion pound luxury market, which continues to grow despite the decline of the luxury goods trade, major luxury goods will be tested in 11 of the country's stores and taken to more stores next year if the item wins another round.
Investment in the retail sector comes as major retail outlets are struggling to make use of the previously non-existent substitutes for talabioji, kitchen appliances and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its production line to nearly 3,000 units, including models such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current seasons from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also feature regionals of the same genre as those found in stores such as Boots.
The big store will also relaunch its lending of modern goods because most of their products become vegan friendly - something that is gaining in demand for smaller retailers.
In addition, the perfumer will try to produce a discount in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the push to buy a little food each day at local convenience stores means that it has to be a must for large grocery stores to actively attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said the side shops will continue to look like department stores as the chain of the main store tries to compete with discounted Aldi and Lidl with additional services and non-food.
Sainsbury's puts Argos's side stores in hundreds of stores as well and has introduced some Habitats since it bought their entire series two years ago, which is that it has further enhanced its food trade where it has also made incomes more profitable.
The great efforts of the store had to be revived and parts of the drug's efforts ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tried a business partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger came to an end after a dispute over how to share money coming from drug stores in its major stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its own 281 drugstore business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's chain, for a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said that Llyods would play a role in the program, making an additional expansion of the range of recreational skincare products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's managing director, said: "We have changed the perception and feel of the retail sector to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in our specially trained colleagues who will be nearby in advising.
Our range of ranges is tailored to suit every need and a charming atmosphere and easy-to-use facilities that means a place to go for a more engaging packaging that challenges the old-fashioned way of buying goods."
Peter Jones 'frustrated' after Holly Willoughby dropped out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has gone on a 'frustration' after television presenter Holly Willoughby walked out of an 11-million-pound contract and her type of business life style to move on to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't really have the time for their home furnishings and the type of supporting material.
Their market is affiliated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old presenter went to Instagram where she announced she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" star Den Peter Jones angrily says she's gone out of her money-making business-style lifestyle at the end of the day - to face her new muscular contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
The sources say Jones was "angry" when the TV celebrity confirmed during a lively conversation on Tuesday at the headquarters of his big business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - which totaled up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - now meant she didn't have enough time to spare for their home appliances and accessories.
The trade is tied to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is said to have attracted the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of Willoughby's holdings.
As Willoughby, 37, joined Instagram and announced that she would be leaving Truly, Jones boarding a plane to make it past one of his vacation homes.
One founder said: "Truth is in the sky of things that Holly excels at.
It will be her long-term love for what she will do in the years to come.
My decision to leave was a surprise to all of them.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's nearing completion.
There is a large warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold."
The experts believe that this morning's planner's trip, which is among Britain's most prolific stars, will lead to the loss of millions to the company due to excessive investment in goods from the front-to-the-back to the candle to clothing and household goods, as well as the possible delay of its launch.
And he will give the meaning of the end to a long-time friend.
Willoughby's three-year-old mother and husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, came in as president in March.
The couple often vacation together and Jones is a 40 percent behind in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be a model ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV presenter for Ni Someone Known.
A spokesman for Jones said: "We're not going to comment on his business dealings.
He said, “We’ve got the [expletive] and we’ve got the [expletive].”
He joked about criticism he would get from the media to make a comment that others would take "what is not right with the president" and being seen as a good thing about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in his own voice that he was "the newsmaker".
"I didn't leave anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second round after their first meeting in Singapore in June that Trump hailed as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But nuclear arms reduction treaties have been defeated.
More than three months after a summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North had seen "no sign of how they've done it" from the United States to North Korea's arms reduction efforts.
On the other hand, he noted that the U.S. continued to impose sanctions with the intention of maintaining pressure.
Trump has taken a position that he feels is possible in his rhetoric.
"Everything is going well for us with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have such a strong relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and recovering other U.S. military bodies at home.
And he ended his way in a kind of conversational tone and interaction with Kim.
"It's easy for a president to behave, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this very popular place, we're going to have about 200 people here," Trump said.
Indonesia’s tsunamis and earthquakes wreak havoc on the Island, hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, no national emergency has been declared, a condition that would trigger national and international aid.
"In many examples, unfortunately, they have clearly shown that they don't ask for national- and international-level help, so it's a bit of a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
When Save the Children joins an organization that is going to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Integration Commission, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if national-level representatives would be allowed to contribute to the support effort.
When you look at the earth, you see that the earth is flat, and you see the earth is flat, and you see the earth is flat, and you see the earth is flat.
Despite the fact that the Tsunami settlements were built in Aceh, they were not becoming a sight to see in areas close to the coast.
The Tsunami's inhumanity to humanity has clearly emerged in Palu, despite the fact that a warning is working, it may well have been to contribute to the loss of life.
In the best cases, the burgeoning between the many Indonesian islands is challenging.
The presence of God makes the distribution of needed goods very difficult.
A boat hospital stationed in Lombok was on its way to Palu to care for those affected by the earthquake, but it would take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo restored Indonesia's damaged buildings to the forefront of his electoral campaign, and invested heavily in roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from the rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism, where the majority of Muslim converts have adopted a strict form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands of dubats lost their homes as Christian and Muslim thugs fought on the streets, wielding axes, bows, and other vicious weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws a horse's ear against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool from a Premier League challenge match where he lost to Chelsea with an 89th-minute win on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge took another shot from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards outside from Chelsea's win with his teammates following a 1–0 win.
He touched the ball to his left before making a run to a distant position.
The attempt lifted above the box where it fell to the top of the right corner of the shaft.
The ball eventually fell to the top of Kepa Arrizabalaga's long jump and fell into the net.
Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com that "It was just an attempt to get in there, I got the ball and players like Shaq always play in front of me as much as possible, so I just tried to create for myself at some point as much as possible."
"I saw Kante coming and he had once and I didn't think about it very much so I just made a shot."
Chelsea were ahead of 1–0 in the first half of the season after getting another win in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker again offered the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the match, before rushing to the centre of the field and the driver in the half of Liverpool.
Suddenly Kovacic made an offer and ran into the middle of the field.
Then he played a good ball, sending Hazard into the box.
Hazard went over the goalkeepers and finished to a long-distance goal position quickly and a left foot where he passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fought Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will add Videoton to the UEFA Europa League Challenge Cup at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
More deaths were recorded in the Indonesian Tsunami to 832
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-pound tsunami, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, was once home to thieves and broken-hearted buildings.
32 And a man went down to his house, and found a young man clothed in linen, and had a girdle round about his loins.
An investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds on the Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police searched for people in the area who saw or heard something and rushed to the scene.
Researcher Brian O’Hagan says: “The survey is a first-to-first step but I would call on anyone around John’s Line in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything that doesn’t agree with him to contact us.
"I will also call again on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a photo in the camera in front of a car to contact us as it is not surprising that they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose daughter’s body was found was a Birkenhead locality and was found in a building.
Today's day friends who believe they know the woman went to the scene to ask questions about her whereabouts this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are preparing to tell the affected brothers.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his home but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He paused as he realized what had happened.
Residents were told that it would take hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered to be a crime scene.
There was a woman who was crying.
She kept repeating the “terrible thing.”
At 2 p.m. two police cars were killed with only one large car outside.
Some officers stood in the barracks looking at the area of the houses.
Anyone with information sent by DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Prevention Service in private on 0800 555 111 using the 247 series reminder of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell’s National Assembly becomes the latest memorial to the ‘historical rewriting crisis’
The green would be the result of responsibility for the manner in which England's historical, cultural and religious sites were destroyed as much as that of the Taliban as its radical followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "stupid" and "effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inescapable in the ongoing debate over the removal of the statue that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become an object of attack.
Attacks on prominent elements of the English Civil War were not ordered by Cromwell to be ordered or not to do so.
Perhaps the worst thing to be seen after Cromwell on his own was the actions of his grandfather Thomas over the past century.
There is a great deal of information about Cromwell's Making William Hamo Thorneycroft that serves as a 19th-century reference point which is also part of the historical record of a famous figure that most believe should still be celebrated on.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more so in the later years of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the House of Commons from external pressure, in the inevitable conflict with the monarchy.
Or maybe it's a matter of history, and it's a matter of history.
What is certain is that the crisis of the mid-17th century fixed the later development of our country, and Cromwell was a well-known figure who represented one part of that crisis.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered."
China's Farmer's Guide to the Future
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to reports from local media.
The man was identified only by his surname "Yuan," which was found in a woman with a cervix in a cut, all blood wrapped around a sty in a market located in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer planned to inject pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining and Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly lashed out at his brother from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found a woman, and he saw a door to a neighboring sty open.
He said that in the styl there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A scientific study of the incident confirmed that 550-square-foot pigs crushed the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My brother's feet were in the blood and in the throat," the cousin mentioned his nickname and his "Wu" machine, according to Guiyang Evening News.
A video from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that the pigs had been closed to prevent him from attacking another individual, during which time the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It was reported that Yuan's family and market authorities were in negotiations to pay compensation for his death.
Although few, examples of the attack on humans by pigs could have been seen.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man in serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig snatched a Welsh farmer up to his tank until his wife terrified the animal to run away.
After an Oregun farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not full of words but the taste of blood could be another "thing with a psalm."
"They're just playing.
They want to know, they want to know... they don't come out to hurt.
You just have to respect them."
The fall of Hurricane Rosa will cause a lot of rain for the south-west of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the surface of the cold waters of the Mexican coast.
But, Rosa will cause torrential rains across northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa is windy by 85 miles per hour, a Type 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning Eastern time, and is seen at 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During the current period, a volcanic eruption began erupting on the surface of the Pacific Ocean where it moved east to the U.S. West Coast.[citation needed] As Rosa approaches Baja California's summit on Monday as a major threat it will begin to project heat into the northern region into the south-west of the U.S.
Rosa will produce up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the condensation of the heat if combined with the approaching surface of the water will create a certain amount of rain that will reach many places in the south-west in the coming days.
In the interior, 1 to 14 inches of rain will cause severe flooding, sedimentation and possible erosion in the desert.
Extreme heat pollution can cause rainfall estimates to experience 2 to 3 inches per hour in areas, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in south-western parts, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of an inexhaustible flood due to which weather damage continues to worsen due to the amount of rain falling in a hot area.
It is a bad idea to go out into the desert and set out to see the threat of surface water in a hot place.
Massive rainfall can cause the estuaries to become runoff rivers and sedimentation will cause dusty air and evaporation of dust.
The approaching surface water surge will bring a lot of domestic rain to parts of Southern California's coastline.
There is likely to be a total rainfall of up to an inch, which will result in a small flow of debris and smooth motorways.
This will be the first rain of the season.
A rain-drop of the heat zone will begin to hit Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will be widespread on Monday and late Tuesday.
A lot of rain will spread throughout the Four Seasons on Tuesday until it reaches into the Arabian Peninsula.
The month of October may see a more volatile climate across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics will also continue to remain warm.
In some cases, this can lead to dramatic changes in some cases.
There's a great example of the dramatic climate differences across Central America on Sunday.
There is about a 20 degree climate difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the warm weather will attempt to stabilize and re-extend.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s spreading from the Southern Hemisphere to the northeastern parts.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, reaching at least 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of an upper-average climate for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's
More than 20 million people have watched the tapes from the forward for Supreme Court seat Brett Kavanaugh and his wife alleging sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on the networks of six television stations.
In the meantime, the political crisis continued, with the media cassing a routine schedule for a Friday night shift at the end: an agreement led by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a weeklong investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh's cake was intoxicating and he tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in disgruntled testimony, said he was 100% certain that the incident had not happened.
It is not surprising that more than 20.4 million people in Nielsen's report watched the event.
The company counts the average viewership by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate reference to the other networks that showed what, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring the people they least expect in their offices.
To be clear, that's like the size of the number of spectators in a football game to whom you get up and give away Academy Awards.
Fox News, which the presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's takeover, led all networks with an average viewership of 5.69 million at the time of the crash and all day long, Nielsen said.
ABC is the second-largest audience of 3.26.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
She was in heaven when she heard.
Flake is famous in the middle of a Friday afternoon.
After the office of the moderate Republican released a statement that he would choose Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday shouting at protesters as he tried to mount a device to take people to the top of the floor to a meeting of the Committee on Justice.
He stood with his eyes on the ground for several minutes while being yelled at, shown on CNN television.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," a woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
He was told, "You have all the power when so many women don't have power."
Flake said his office had released a statement and said, before the pick-up device closed, that he had a lot to say at the board meeting.
The cable networks and broadcasters all broadcast what happened hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to send Kavanaugh's name to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the case against the one named next week, which was hoped by Democrats.
Flake was content to have a little chat with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice is strong, as it is clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May lash out at critics of Brexit and 'political correctness'
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised critics of her plans to leave the European Union and "turn politics" towards the future of Britain and the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview ahead of her on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson railed against his attack on her Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a resolution that Britain and the European Union should take on each other's exit money was "one front."
The Wayne Sims Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murdering the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspect in the brutal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old and basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, the police department said in a statement.
Officials released a video of the tape between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glass during the fight.
The police found the glass from the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB report affiliated with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had pleaded guilty to Wayde’s heinous shooting.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate's report.
The Office of the Investigator on the Eastern Baton Rouge Massacre released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to your past.
The ministry commended Louisiana State Police officers for the arrest of the fugitive, the state's Criminal Science Experimental Police Station, and Southern University police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement officers for their work of "restraint and see justice done."
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6 and 6-foot tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and regained a score of 2.6 in a given period of time.
On Friday morning, LSU bowler coach Will Wade said the team had experienced "anarchy" and "shock" at Wayde's death.
"That's what people always worry about," he said.
A large limestone volcano erupts over Mexico City
The smoke billowing from Popocatepetl's large limestone fire reaches its southern neighbor in the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Pollution Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to get too close to the dusk after it peaked at the eruption where 183 greenhouse gas emissions and ash were recorded for more than 24 hours.
The center is in charge of citadels and landslides.
Photographs in the social network show a thin expanse of ash clinging to the body of a car glass in neighboring Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Climate scientists have observed an increase in activity at Dutsin, which sits 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "For Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence rally
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters staged a stand-off with riot police, and as many as tens of thousands joined a counter-protest to mark a round of voting that split Catalonia over the break-up.
A group of break-up supporters who blindfolded them and were held by the police deliberately threw them away and spray-painted them with powder paint, creating some dark clouds in the streets that often fill the bellows with tourists.
Clashes broke out the next day as the police used their guard to prevent the fighting.
For more than a few hours several pro-independence groups responded "No forgetting, no apology" and clashed with pro-independence protesters shouting, "God bless Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they heard in the protests, according to local media reports.
There was still so much violence in the province that he set his sights on independence a year after the October 1st referendum that Madrid considers illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted heavily where they voted for freedom although not much emerged where those who did not want to vote narrowly boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, at least 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to rig votes cast at polling stations across the province in the midst of the violence.
Gunmen of the freedom fighters camped outside at night in support of the National Police.
The protests continued but she was forced to take a different approach.
Narcis Termes, 68, a Latvian attending the independence movement with his wife said he did not and hoped to see the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we lived in one of our best moments.
"I saw my parents crying because of the chance to vote, but now we're stuck in it," he said.
Despite the conduct of an important victory even though it was a stalemate in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalan parties struggled to keep up this year's momentum with many of their most prominent leaders either going to seek refuge they had set themselves up or were arrested and awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who takes part in the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the crisis had been quelled by politicians on all sides.
"It's getting a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan presidents in custody since the end of last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Sitting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reverse the democratic and repressive assessments we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men arrested after being hit by a car at home
Some men, aged 33, 34 and 29, have been arrested after a small car was rerouted into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Deputy Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the doors and even his own house had been vandalized.
It is also possible that a fire broke out in a small car.
Menga's win against Livingston 1 and 0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's goal for Livingston
Livingston's rise to prominence surprised the Rangers by keeping Steven Gerrard only up to his second goal in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack was somewhat controversial because Gary Holt's side moved the table with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's side is without a better win in this season's Premiership and will face the Leaders Hearts, who are in charge of eight goals, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers had taken on Rapid Vienna in a Europa League match on Thursday.
During that time, Livinsgton, increased their standings by giving them a spot in the zone to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste beating since he replaced Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston has lost an opportunity for their visitors.
The Holt team should be said to be ahead of the pack before eating, with their own encounters causing the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson got pregnant but pulled his efforts forward by winning, it was here that Alan Lithgow could only face his efforts after making the ground up to meet your copy of Craig Halkett's.
The lowlifes agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make it harder for the visitors on the singles list.
That's how important food is.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston worked another chance, joined by Declan Gallagher and Robinson to design Menga, which he touched and ate from the center of the box.
At this point, Rangers dominated holding the ball but found the house guard would not allow it to pass and catcher Liam Kelly was completely unconcerned.
This situation continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was forced to a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't get the right out of Rangers' bowler Allan McGregor's foot and Lithgow opened up quite a bit from a game designed by Livingston.
And then they hit everywhere they took to the Livingston box where their cure was still being developed, when a shot was found from the head to the top - after Halkett's challenge on replacing Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand touch - where the side was wound.
‘Wonderful’ from Livingston – study
Alasdair Lamont Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Region
It's a great game for livingston.
For a man, they were very impressed, going beyond what was expected on the surface of what he had done.
Their style of play and staff have changed a bit since their return to top position, but high praise should go to Holt and the kind of way he has united the team since his arrival.
He's got a lot of
Captain Halkett arranged, where he did by setting up a good defense, when Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet entirely.
The Rangers almost lost their courage.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerrard, they failed to find such a balance.
Their last fight wasn't enough - they just once cut the side of the house open - and it was a refreshing call for Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a similar reception in Cologne
A variety of smiles and blue skies were seen on Saturday (29 September) where Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
On her last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to mend ties between NATO allies.
They found disagreement on some issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then passed through Cologne to open a new mosque complex.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police brought in security reasons to block a crowd of about 25,000 from the crowd in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - have declared their voices, calling them "God-with-all" in support of Erdogan's decision and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests of the place feature the break-up of the arrival of a visitor whom the German Turks hail as a hero and a toss-up for the rest.
Deptford road accident : The cyclist died in a car crash
A motorcyclist died in an accident involving a small car in London.
The event took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and medical personnel arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened months after a cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Road, about a mile from the site of Saturday night's crash.
The Birni police said officers were working to identify the man who informed his family.
Roads were closed and bus routes were changed and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Term Care: Six people have been injured in the crash
Six officers were injured in the violence in a high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The violence broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Specialists of the "Tornado" were brought in to deal with the violence, which consisted of eight prisoners and was reduced to a single section.
The officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
According to a spokesperson for the Prison Service: "The skilled personnel trained to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin have been deployed.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries sustained.
We didn't look forward to the violence in our prisons, and they made it clear that those involved would be deployed and that they might be out in the cellars for a long time."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after an inmate attacked him.
And in October of the previous year, riot police officers dealt with a violent attack in which workers and gamers were attacked.
The Great Storm of Rosa Falls in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and the Rising Flood (White Mountains May Have More)
It didn't quite happen to say that any warming was due to Arizona, but this is what may have happened as early as next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosan's energy follows a dot across the South-East Desert, where it produces a confluence of rising floods.
The National Weather Service has already released observational data on Monday's and Tuesday's rising oil spills for Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt.
The Rosa is expected to take another route up Phoenix on Tuesday, pushing to the end of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service noted in a statement released on Twitter that only "ten small wind storms have produced a tropical or subduction zone between 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most updated National Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches of rain falling in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are not surprised to find 1 to 2 inches wide with a total not including as much as 4 inches wide as possible.
For those who are not at risk of a rising flood, the surface water of the Rose may have been a mercy since the area was experiencing a drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, one of these surface waters would benefit since the South-west is now seeing a drought-stricken climate.
According to the U.S. White House, just over 40 percent of Arizonans see at least one extreme white, the second-highest variety," according to the weather.com report.
At first, the course of Hurricane Rosa was passed to landfall through the Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, still with the greatest gust force on Sunday mornings with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and pushing at 12 miles per hour.
The climate is saturated with cold water in the Pacific Ocean so it's submerged.
As a result, it is expected to land below ground in Mexico in the intensity of the rainy season and in the daytime or evening on Monday.
It's not surprising that the rainfall across parts of Mexico has become so high, causing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to the south-west of Sonora," according to the weather.com report.
Rosa will then follow north through Mexico as a tropical rainforest before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical summer retreat, where she will then follow through the sky through Arizona and into southern Itah by the end of Tuesday night.
"The biggest risk expected from Rosa or her sightings is heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These waters are expected to produce torrential rains and effluents in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the area of Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Tunnel, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "responsible" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon the Somerset Police Department.
The students asked anyone who might have had a small video of the mobile phone incident that came up.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered, verbally, anger’ of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and aggressive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the Democratic Party's "torment of unhappiness, anger" by posting his name.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, and is also furious at the rejection of a quote from Christine Blasey Ford that sexually assaulted her several years ago as teenagers.
Ford has also testified to the authenticity of his identity.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the art with the beauty and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh West was a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, a jurist with a distinguished record of public service work," he said on the public forum of West Virginia fans.
The president made little comment about the rollout of Kavanaugh's name while speaking about the use of Republican pop in mid-camp elections.
"Listen five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not going to stop, but I'm actually going to stop."
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump in the Democratic debate is on a mission to "hate and play hide-and-seek."
The first major avenue for long-term voting in the Senate on Kavanaugh's election is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to the GOP's chief executive told CNN.
They will be raised from the dead, and they will be raised from the dead.
At least 384 people were killed, traveling with others due to massive waves falling on the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the coast of the city of Palu on Friday as the waves that swept across the sky (three of them 18) blew ashore at night, where they wiped out many dead and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7-magnitude and 5-magnitude earthquake.
"As the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people at the time were doing their jobs on the coast and did not immediately run to where they were affected," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Policing Board (BNPB), said in a brief interview with journalists in Jakarta.
"Tsunami came by itself, attracting small cars, timbers, houses, and hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mi/h) before landing on the coast.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs taken from above by the risk agency again showed buildings and shops in ruins, bridges crumbling and being surrounded by a water mosque.
An earlier shake-up of the city near the sea continued on Saturday.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. . . .
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) in a statement said the force released by the massive earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The climate of the city, which sits at the end of a small, long stream, may have widened the size of the tsunami, its engine.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said tens of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and a hotel had all collapsed.
The bodies of the victims were found lying in the mud under collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll from the damage would increase significantly along the 300-mile (190-mile) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala,
Communication "the whole world has stood still and there is no story" from Donggala, a Nugroho genie.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were referring to the affected areas.
"It's a disaster, but it can get worse," she said.
The commission was sharply criticized on Saturday for not announcing that a tsunami would strike Palu, although officials said the waves came between the time the warning was issued.
An inexplicable video shared on social media can be heard by a person on the roof of a building shouting a tsunami warning for people on the road below.
Within minutes a wall of water fell over the sea, carrying buildings and small cars.
The Reuters news agency could not immediately confirm the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis led to electrical blackouts and disconnections around Palu causing difficulty for authorities in joining coalition rescue efforts.
Troops began sending large cargo ships and support from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the captured ones are still in great need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's only airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 800
It was very bad.
Although World Vision staff returned to Palu safely from Donggala, where the staff were living in a bus stop set up on the front of their office, they showed a pattern of collapse along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said we saw a lot of houses that had collapsed," he said.
It was very disappointing.
Despite groups of aid workers starting a major operation starting a disaster relief operation, some have complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian standards, the spending, production and provision of personnel from abroad will only begin if a place of persecution is pronounced as a national disaster camp.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a flat area of disaster," said Alia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "He did, this will be a national disaster," we will open for land-and-land relief but there is no status yet."
As the second night falls on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the victims hope that their relatives will be miracles that will revive the unpleasant narratives of the earth's natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was removed from an elderly wife.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian Athletic Association, coached the two missing athletes of the Asian Athletics, which finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Hearing from those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in a game that comes down from the top, I'm also a little bit nervous about what I'm hearing," he said.
Gendon explained how, within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel being broadcast among the community of the game landing from the top, he sent WhatsApp messages in duguzume to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His letters, however, only resulted in the appearance of a single gray stripe of paint, instead of a pair of blue stripe prints.
"I don't think it's a message," he said.
Robbers took $26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on Departure
The thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee refilling an ATM in Newport on Dabha, according to a story released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of a small car pulls an ATM into a recreational building and plans to bring in more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy writes in the announcement.
During his time at work, a man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of cash to be brought in.
Eyewitness witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime according to the statement, but the police did not clarify the number of those involved.
Anyone with information about their testimony should contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The Rapper changes the name - to Ye.
In a tweet announcing the change of name on Saturday, he wrote: "I used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye is nicknamed for West, who is 41 years old for a while and used the moniker in the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show which he canceled for "the reason of his disappointment," the show's creator said.
As a shorthand for his current professional name, West once said the term had a religious meaning to it.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier that year, discussing the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"That's why I'm you.
It goes from Kanye, which means one, to the sole You - just a mantra of our beauty, our deception, everything.
It's like a sign of who we are."
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by a variety of names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that his priority was the names Love and Brother Love.
West's co-founder, JAY-Z, also had to make do with or without a short line of middle-of-the-word and major accents.
Mexico's Amlo promised not to use soldiers on civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force on civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "that there will be no more or less use of soldiers to crush the people of Mexico."
The rioters fired on a peaceful protest at the center on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at one time as student socialists began to take refuge in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promises to support young Mexicans by offering monthly scholarships to those studying and by opening more public universities for free.
He also said that unemployment and a lack of access to education are leading young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should spend the money.
As China becomes increasingly active in non-indigenous intelligence, the U.S. should double down on what it spends on in-field analysis, a non-indigenous intelligence-testing investment machine called Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government commented on the AI of non-indigenous intelligence, even though the U.S. lost an AI strategy in custody.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it is trying to become the first in the AI ecosystem by 2030.
"Increasing the budget for AI will be a good start, seeing that all other countries are far ahead of the U.S. and we're looking for something new in AI," Lee said.
A doubling of spending could undermine opportunities for achieving the next big AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in a separate interview this week.
Lee, who was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures China, who has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the more powerful American athlete Othello, and later became an elected leader at Microsoft Research and the head of Google's China branch.
Lee has fallen behind the U.S. government's competition on technology such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge where he asked when the front line would be held, because it helped identify forward visionaries.
Studying in the United States usually takes a lot of hard work due to overspending on government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes education leaders; it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have taken on the task of hiring top academics from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in the decision-making process could also help the U.S. from its AI efforts.
"I feel that the chain drives should be vertically produced for graduates in the field of non-indigenous AI," he said.
The National Assembly of China issued the Non-Original Crypto Development Program for its Future Nation in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China has provided funding for people in education-type schools to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund U.S. analysts, but the value of education work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Inauthentic Crypto Center, designed to engage partners from industry and school, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Inauthentic Crypto.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an effort called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. law seeking to create a National Security Agency over non-indigenous crypto has seen no action in months.
Macedonian citizens cast a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday or changed its name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia," in a move that would resolve an old dispute with Greece that blocked its application for membership for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a request on its border and that it has taken the same seat as its entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments gained a position in June based on a new name they had determined, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would reduce the ethnic evidence of the many Slavs of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the dispute and a relocation company had cast doubt on whether the number of exits would reach the 50 percent threshold needed to divide the dispute by improvement.
The question on the referendum reads: "You are a NATO member of the European Union and agree to an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a sacrifice to follow the involvement of agencies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to cast lots for the return of the country, for young people in Macedonia because they can live freely under the yoke of the European Union because it means a secure life for us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it does not have legal force, enough members of Congress have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it more equitable.
A change of name would require a majority of two-thirds of the legislature.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of problems as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at only 15 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, together with his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted to split the dispute in Macedonia over a name change that would open the way for NATO and European Union accession in Strumica, Macedonia on September 3, 2018.
In front of the lower house of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small bonfire and pulled up seats in front of the tent-tents who were evading the division of the dispute.
"We are NATO and the European Union, but we want to enter with dignity, not through the door of action," Kavadarkov said.
"We're a small country, but we're poor.
If they don't want to consider us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European and Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a NATO member would bring significant investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe very much they will because more than 80 percent of our citizens love the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said an "yes" would be a confirmation of our future.
A popular vote published on Monday by the Macedonian Centre for Population Studies said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the dispute - the country with the required output.
A popular opinion poll, by Macedonian broadcaster Telma, found 57 percent of respondents were preparing to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them want to go.
To split the argument she won and the requirement for the exit was 50 percent by an additional one vote.
A failure to share the dispute would be the first problem for the decision of Western government supporters since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has toured through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have sent Brighton's defences in the Manchester City 2 and 0 defeats on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed a slight degradation on his eating in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received another pitch in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran among the Brighton Rangers, before cutting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four sacks of clothes.
He pushed around one guard before avoiding the others on the side of Brighton's trunk.
He then sent a tender to his right, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first pitch in the box to give a ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalpost and a handful to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some issues in his club," City manager Pep Guardiola said in a statement.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened
We had a chance to win a meal."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in a Premier League match crisis.
The meal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton limit very well in this match.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few pitfalls before leading Sterling to the end of a long-distance standoff.
The Sky Blues forward hit the ball into the net just before exiting the limits.
The city is battling Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a misfit with the Rockies
As the Nationals were removed from the tournament again, there was no reason to force a restart.
But the league's all-time fan Scherzer is hoping to take Sunday's rally against the Colorado Rockies, but only if only a handful of replays for the Rockies, who are holding a playoff lead at the top of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies have at least earned a pop-card win with a 5th and 2nd win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still seeking to close their first division ranks.
"Even though we're playing a bit of a game, at least we can play a game of rugby knowing that the situation in Denver is with the public arena and one team will play at every higher table of every major league I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to do that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a start for Sunday but have reportedly wanted to let Scherzer exacerbate the situation.
Scherzer, who will be 34 years old, threw a big hit on Thursday and will be on his regular Sunday break.
The Washington proper holder is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and a 300 outside stroke in 220 2/3 innings this time.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the circumstances surrounding his choice for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the benefits of Republican outings in midterm elections.
"We did it all in November.
Five weeks from now is one of the most useful choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the biggest, biggest - I'm not going to stand up but I'm actually going to stand up and make it happen every place I'm fighting for my fellow citizens.
Trump continued, "You've seen this disaster, this Democratic disaster, you've seen what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by using every opportunity they can, you see the sadness, the lack of virtue.
They have no power over the waters, and they have no power over the rivers, and they have no power over the waters.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "opposing and restraining."
"And you have seen that in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and sad and bitter and unfair."
He mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who was shouted at by the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you do the job?
Uh, uh, me.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one - that's the worst sign of dishonesty - the worst sign of dishonesty I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer a synagogue.
It is an impatience of those who say what is in their hearts
And when they had made a covenant with him, he would not have made a covenant with them, nor would he have made a covenant with them.
Since, I'm the newest member in a line of Labour MPs to be told we're not welcome - all because of the abysmal fighting that's in our hearts.
My friend in Congress, Joan Ryan, was so humiliated because she stood up and fought against the idea of hating the Jews.
For example, I've been asked to stop by Jeremy Corbyn.
On the basis of a positive economic decision, on national security, on Europe, unfortunately the same issues were repeatedly rejected by Jeremy's predecessors.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Convention on Friday concluded, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and meaningful."
For most of the eight-year term as a Labour member of parliament, the same was true of the night of the GC meetings.
Unfortunately today, it is not the feature of many gatherings and the political promise of "consciousness, mindfulness" is forgotten if, too, it has ever been initiated.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views within the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is judged on whether it will be accepted by party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became president, because colleagues I feel in our kind of political circles have started to think that I would make a turnaround and take a stance that I would never agree with - either on national security or on a single European Union market.
Every day I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - it's just that social media forums are calling for re-election, central politics are being ignored, we're being told that I should be out of the Labour Party.
That's not all I saw
In fact, I know that I've been fortunate more than any of my colleagues because the orders I'm faced with are often political.
I'm in a tea party of the idea of experience and determination by these co-workers who face a gender or racial slur every day but never run away.
One of the saddest aspects of this era of politics is the way in which corruption is commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
What's real is that now we're not that big a church giving every issue of "unacceptable ability" or changing electoral laws to say the party is getting smaller.
Over the past two years, I've had a lot of conversations with people about how to be quiet, but I'm not going to be "silent."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
"Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, who had received the praise from the Thatcher government's efforts to let my entire school class fall apart, I thought of myself as a champion of reforming public works for those in great need - whether in the position of a local councillor or minister of government.
I've never had a problem with politics, even in the past.
None of Nottingham East would be said to have ventured into confusion about the position of my determination and regions of dissent with the current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's issue, what I would just say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government jobs, I don't understand the desire to waste time and courage on my submission to the Labour Party leader.
But actually the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to constituents, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to work for the public and I promise that there's no kind of re-election threat or political delusion that will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best thing for the public to do.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeatable Ayr made heaven
Two slow trials have surpassed the final results of some sort, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this incredible pastime of tennis Premiership of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only part not beaten for ten.
In the end, their defense was much higher, as was their ability to speak more effectively, which took over the side of the house and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be happy.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we haven't been beaten yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took their chances far more than we did."
The 14-minute test of Anderson's speed, changed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, another card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to play the numbers against Jason Baggot
Climo extended Ayr's presidency with a plebiscite, before, during the half-time break, he ate it up and replaced a self-test alone to make it 17 to 5 to Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half right and Patrick Anderson tried, and Baggot switched, reducing the passageway to five steps.
There was at the time a long delay for another massive injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried over the late, and a re-start, Ayr pushed ahead the top by a test by Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
The acting captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, as well as, Melrose made the man pay for an irreplaceable Bruce Colvine test, eventually a devastating pressure attack.
The part of the house came back, but, and when a yellow card was handed out at Struan Hutchinson to confront Climo without a ball, from the line outside the penalty spot, MacPherson touched down from behind the approaching Ayr tackle.
Climo changed his tune, as he did again at least from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box and sent Gregor Henry another out for the fifth home side test.
Star Game is still preparing for a new job in the food retail industry
Still the star of Game Ford Kieran shows he's ready to step into the care industry after being found out he's been given the position of director of a food licensing company.
The 56-year-old appears in Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC drama, which he co-wrote with fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming nine-part series would be the last in the running of the program, and revealed Kiernan was preparing to live after Craiglang.
According to the company's serial reporting, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to say anything about the story, though a Scottish Sun news outlet lamented that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's "sustainable food sales market."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia covering the land in hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Shipyards patrol the naval headquarters' outpost in La Paz.
Government buildings are off the flag of the blue sea.
Forts of naval forces from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon where the motto is worn: "The Sea is ours in right.
It is our right to return."
In general Bolivia is surrounded by land, remembering the loss of a coastal area to Chile a terrible 19th-century material blessing crisis is still evident - because it is necessary to re-route through the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
These kinds of blacks are probably the largest in years, at a time when Bolivia is awaiting a lower court ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of being plagued by misunderstandings.
"Bolivia is energetic, with a spirit of unity and stability, and of course expects a good point to come out," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The Bolivians will look at the World Court’s ruling on large-scale telebiology across the country, hoping that The Hague’s court will find a position of acceptance of Bolivia’s petition – after many years of unsuccessful negotiations – Chile agrees to negotiate granting Bolivia the right to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's president-elect - who is facing a messy re-election battle next year - has plenty of chances from Monday's verdict.
"We're almost back to the Pacific Ocean," in a statement in late August.
But some black pirates believed that it would be difficult for her to decide how much Bolivia wanted - and that nothing would change if she did.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant Chile's borders, and has made it clear that it will not be determined what constitutes a possible dialogue.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after hearing the final argument indicated the case was "not confusing," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And he didn't come close to helping Bolivia's legal system, four years ago each drew her back.
"The present government of Bolivia has seized the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
"Morales' ill-conceived policies have ended all sympathy for Chile, in her opinion.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, has dismissed the point that the court's decision-making process is not as fast as it used to be.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new chapter of relations with Chile" and a chance to "bring another end to 139 years of discord and mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who was still one of Latin America's most popular leaders - had used the issue of the sea as a political issue.
He added that "Bolivia will never relinquish the right of access to the Pacific Ocean."
"It's an opportunity to see what happens next."
North Korea says nuclear arms reduction won't come until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said his country would never part with nuclear weapons unless it trusted Washington.
Ri is speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises made at a summit in Singapore among future leaders.
His decision comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of relaunching a diplomatic push back on nuclear more than three months after a Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a "dream" that continued to impose U.S. sanctions on any statement that ending the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is skeptical that I agree with the statement without Pyongyang first making a couple of significant reductions.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great deal of disbelief that Pyongyang is not very committed to abandoning a weapon that the country sees as almost the only way to guarantee its own protection.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to organize a second summit with Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show brings out the newest line in your wardrobe on its way to a Great Titi near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat that you have accumulated or blocked the entire day, then don't go ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased their high-end headwear beautifully for their SS19 collection on the go-around that inspired the style established at Paris Fashion Week.
Unthinkable bloggers have dominated Instagram with this concern and these fashion designers have poured their creative eyeballs at the bottom of the trending fashion show.
What comes out of Valentino is a top hat worn with a hairdo that dominates the show's models.
Other great support items include a self-adhesive jacket, a cap with even a scarf - but not designed to keep warm on your own.
Thom Browne also starred in a selection of amazing face masks - and only for the Halloween season.
Many of the colored face plates have stitching on the lips and look like Hannibal Lecter instead of a haute couture style of decoration.
One was like a scuba diving gear with snorkels and glasses, and another was like a melting milk pipe.
And if you continue with the great information on jewelry - you're successful.
Fashion watchers speculated that large bonnets could start to hit the main streets near you.
The giants come well on the high heels of 'La Bomba', a striped cap with two short bows seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The much-loved shape of the cap has been aired in social media that sends a huge buzz to the point of a fashion show - to a beach bag almost as large as a model of a bathing suit in worn water.
The orange-coloured sack, fixed with the upper raffia-side of a white leather sailor, is the highlight of Jacquesmus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week. Jacquesmus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris
Notable fashionista Luke Armitage said at FEMAIL: ‘I think I see big deals and beach ambassadors coming on the big street for the next worry – because the designer made a big impact it will be hard to forget about the need for big sponsorships.’
John Edward: Key linguistic skills for international citizens
Scotland's private schools hold a record of excellence in terms of knowledge, and this continued in 2018 with a portion of the results of their outstanding exams, which are only won by individuals combined in sports, art, music and other community events.
With an additional 30,000 school children across Scotland, these schools, which are funded by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are poised to provide a better working environment for young children and their parents.
Private schools have the goal of preparing their children for greater access to higher education, a way of life they have chosen to place them as citizens of the world.
As a part of the knowledge that can design and implement the school curriculum in question, we see modern languages continuing to evolve in popularity and the desired lesson of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that comes into his own.
If you speak in tongues, it enters his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examination, we can see that languages are at the top of the graph tables with higher estimates in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have read foreign languages earn an A-grade.
The data, collected from 74 school members of the SCIS, show that 72 percent of the students scored an A-grade in Mandarin, and 72 percent of those who read German, 69 percent of those who read French and 63 percent who read Spanish also scored an A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key discipline that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as an elective course, held at the same level as STEM courses (science, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A morning report by the UK Agency for Employment and Skills in 2014 found reasons given by employers to struggle to fill vacancies, attributed 17 per cent to a lack of sufficient linguistic skills.
So many language skills are becoming increasingly important because young people are being prepared for future events in life.
With more work opportunities available to language learners, these skills are essential in a dynamic world.
Regardless of the type of career someone chooses to pursue in life, if they learn a second language, they will actually have an advantage in a future wise by living a life like this:
Having the opportunity to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will directly put a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in England in 2013, 75 percent were too quick to speak a foreign language so well that they could converse and French became only a spoken language and only one percent of a two-digit substitution by a contact, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is now beneficial for the children of tomorrow.
The availability of many languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more advanced languages, but others will teach languages that are considered the most useful for England when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests, there will always be some language of choice from the private schools, with tutors specializing in the area.
Scotland's private schools are dedicated to creating a learning environment that will prepare children who lack the strength of the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
You cannot be rejected at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to play a useful role for the future of the country, so you must put this into practice in knowledge.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "national and national communication skills."
Private schools will continue to provide this option, staying together and excelling for young people of Scotland.
It's the fair of the fair.

LeBron will make Lakers appear on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening season of Lahdi and Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We just don't know how long it will play.
"It'll be more than one close to 48," Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James would each make a limited number of minutes of play.
After the test earlier this week, James was asked about his preparations for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need to play games in advance at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's Visit to West Virginia - YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a few more rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
"It's the first of five Trump meetings in the next week that will include a stand-off in friendships with Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the confirmation vote that he chose to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to build support for the midterm elections that will come as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the National Assembly in time for the vote in November.
When is Trump's nightly meeting in West Virginia and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally was scheduled for Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. this evening Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below when it's being held on YouTube.
Trump was not surprised to speak on the sidelines this week for the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, who has cracked down on sexual assault with the expectation of a Senate vote suspension for another week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this meeting platform was to help Republicans facing the November elections get some energy.
So, the Trump campaign said the purpose of these five gatherings over the next week was "to cheer on activists and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand beyond the population they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The formation of the National Assembly is so important to his agenda that the president will go to a lot of states when we're entering a period of non-existence," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters but declined to be named.
The pre-order for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight will bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the media to come to Pittsburgh," according to Metro News' West Virginia.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state that accounted for more than 40 percent of the drop in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia's Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrissey that until the president comes along to try to increase his popularity in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows up to fight for the hopes of winning in singles Sunday
After a few side-evenings, the four-week Saturday game will be just what this Ryder Cup requires.
The change in attitude of the year was a general game-changer but one that players really believed in, and it was never the case unless competing like these ones.
Where do you think the two are now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take that as a two-pointer in my mind," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has an advantage, in fact, four leagues ahead with an additional twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little help in the matter although they have a lot of things to encourage them, most at least it's not the kind of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each lifts three feet out of four.
Spieth was poisoned from tee to green and led by example.
These festive shouts echoed as his circle continued, sinking an important element to take up four squares when he and Thomas were both killed after the two.
His attempt to win them the match on the 15th where he met a kind of whim, which shows you he believes the American team is not part of this.
"You've got to really get down to earth and worry about your game," Spieth said.
Each one of them has gone astray.
18 points for a second round
The only players with more pitches than Spieth and Thomas above for two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an underrated legend of the Ryder Club.
A married couple of the same type but desired for European are four out of four and will not do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" became the only two not to shoot an organization on a Saturday afternoon but also to avoid its preparation on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and afternoons on Friday mornings.
This has passed, and the extent to which their energy passes entirely from the to and fro of the crowd who have insisted that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will no longer be any more players to cover a victory that can be made by Europe as the sun rises on top of Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
If you want to be in different places at the same time
The words of Europe's glory have not yet appeared.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson performed the short work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four morning balls, during which they were paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and a double-double on the front of a nine-foot-tone Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they had never come close to going out.
On Sundays, though, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four senses and the four senses are interesting at least from close range because of the interaction between the two attachments, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way in which a particular technique can coexist in a particular niche.
The Europeans have played so much as a team so far and have become leaders on the last day but this fourth season also shows that Team USA is pregnant for the fight of saying that, especially the Stateside, they are skeptical.
Europe draws ahead 10th and 6th at the end of the Ryder Cup
Europe will get another win on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from Saturday's four goals and four-game playoffs with another draw of 10 and 6 in the United States.
The two courageous Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a change and two winning streak on top of Tiger Woods struggling to take the number one spot so far at Le Golf National to four touchdowns.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, the cup-holder failed to win at Hazeltine two years ago, occupying an hour-long absence at the U.S. side in four morning goals, taking the 3rd and 1st consecutive draws.
The U.S. increased the intensity in the quarter-finals, winning two games, but they quickly lost in the rebellion.
Jim Furyk's department requires a pack of 12 Sunday's singles games to hold the cup.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four touchdowns while against Molinari, who was said to be "Molliwood" after a spoken weekend and were the only two pairs to score four touchdowns from the opening of their four games in Ryder Cup history.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the four goals they then got up and beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau's and another sighting of 5th and 4th.
Woods, who pulled himself into two games on Saturday, made an academic appearance but has now lost 19 of his games in four goals and four-legged matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for four goals in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in four-match doubles to a 2nd and 1st win by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's top three scorer.
Europe hasn't got as easy as it gets, a south-westerly windy day in Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a line for the Americans with a double draw on Saturday.
They earned a comfortable 2nd and 1st place win over Spain's Jon Rahm Ian Poulter in four goals and a comeback later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in four games after losing the win by opening both holes.
Only once in Ryder Cup history did a team recover from a four-game loss in singles, though as the hosts of the Furyk division needed only a horse stand to hold the cup.
After being the second best of two days, however, another Sunday attack seemed to be stronger than theirs.
North Korea says ‘no way’ to reduce weapons alone without integrity
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its opposition to the United States and that there was no way for the country to leave its nuclear weapons alone under similar circumstances.
Ri Yong told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea has taken "precautionary measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear tests with nuclear weapons, destroying a nuclear test site, and promising not to add nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any response from the United States," he said.
"Without any American safety there would be no courage in our national security and under such circumstances there would be no way we alone would have reduced our arms in the first place."
While holding on to repeated known South Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to pursue a "senseless" approach to reducing nuclear weapons under his control to give North Korea a free hand while taking some careful steps, his speech was pronounced important because it did not refuse to reduce its nuclear weapons just as Pyong did so.
Ri took a look at a joint speech by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at an unprecedented summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work toward "a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" when Trump promised to secure a North Korean nuclear deal.
North Korea was seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. said Pyongyang had to abandon its nuclear weapons from the start.
Washington has also called for the easing of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is committed to 'the nuclear war from the beginning' and has increased its level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and has even rejected the 'end-of-war poverty'," Ri said.
"Understanding that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who actually have something about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to increase our disapproval."
Ri did not comment on preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president made at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister commented on three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the country is involved in this issue of denuclearization, it will be said that South Korea is not the United States leaving a nuclear-armed North Korea that has not had the same problem."
However, Ri's rhetoric was somewhat different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that within the U.S. and the Korean Peninsula it was something he had to sing after "Mr. President Disaster Seeker" Trump called Kim a "rocketed man" seeking suicide.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his ability to take steps to reduce weapons, but said there was still work to be done and sanctions were still in place to keep North Korea off nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five years - no worries."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should give Pyongyang a free hand for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be enforced to a great extent without fail until we see a complete and finally determined nuclear stockpile."
North Korea has been under tightened sanctions since 2006 by the Security Council in a bid to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly where he said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to organize a second general meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his arrival has been less than pleasant.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but only that within hours North Korea had abandoned the pursuit of "needs like aliens."
North Korea has promised in a few minutes with the Moon this month that it would demolish a nuclear test site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes "some steps in part."
He said Kim had told him "some of the steps by the party" he was seeking were a guarantee of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and a move towards a balanced relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep.
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep in an effort to curb the size of the cardboard culture by taking a 'all-nighter' course.
A teacher finds students at one university in the world usually know nothing when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
His attention was drawn to the beginning of the course after he spoke about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning knowledge.
Then a woman came up to me and said, “Why are you saying this in the last year?”
She said no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep - which surprised her," she told The Telegraph.
The course kicked off its first season that year, explaining to students the benefits of how good sleep habits help academic performance and athletics, and even improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said it was the university's decision to introduce the course after it found that students were strictly prohibited from sleeping during the week.
An hour-long course includes a series of other conversational activities.
In one section there is a chapter by a dormitory, where students grind coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how the activity of alkalinity affects the lack of adequate sleep, and the customary use of what to do during bedtime.
In another section, participants were told how preventing prolonged sleep apnea can increase the frequency of heart attacks, strokes, depression and colds.
A school map, with transactional symbols, then encourages attendees to think about what they are doing on their daily basis.
And we know that he will not be able to do that.
But we believe they are free to know – just as you are a free to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Professor Czeisler added.
The custom of filling the mouth in the 'dawn of all night' is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the constant pressure on students means preventing sleep is starting to become a big problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, a good one, should be a ‘hidden weapon’ for the student to suppress depression, fatigue and anxiety, or to avoid fatigue, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of indigestion, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California reader of physical chemistry and plant and animal biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course, after taking one of his last year's classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and attracted him to send the course across the school.
It is hoped that the next step, will ask all students of the department for further studies after graduation to complete the type of study preparation prior to entering the competitive school.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should take care of setting a wake-up call during their sleep, even when they wake up, and recognize the harmful effects of ‘light rays’ emanating from the surfaces of electrical and LED light products, which can cause your health system to wake up in a state of shock.
Livingston 1 and Rangers 0: Menga's Cake Demeans Gerrard's People
Rangers suffered a setback when Dolly Menga's attack shortened Steven Gerrard's side to a 1–0 win at Livingston.
The Ibrox side are seeking to produce their first goal on the road since a 4th and 1st win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a manager leaving his side with eight goals in a crash on the road to Ladbrokes Premier Hearts leaders.
Menga attacked seven minutes before half-time and a short shot of the Rangers on a draw that never looked like a flatbed.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is also up to third and only behind the Hibernian on the score difference.
And there can be more tension in the setting for the Rangers after only a linear caretaker Calum Spence of an injury has been treated after clearly throwing something out from the end of the place.
Gerrard made eight changes to the part that threw Ayr into the games before the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with an 11-year-old Livi who removed the lead from the Hearts last week and was thrilled with the way the coaches had beaten their opponents in every turn.
The Rangers would be said to have dominated possession of the ball but Livingston did a lot of things with the ball they got.
It should be said that they only ate in the first two minutes of Menga's first exchange sent Scott Pittman through to devour Allan McGregor but the midfielder widened his chances considerably.
An all-star rival of Keaghan Jacobs then finds a goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his close friend the defender Alan Lithgow is only able to expand behind the position.
The Rangers had just captured control but there was a hint of more optimism rather than acceptance about their game in the final three.
Alfredo Morelos of course felt he should have had a head-to-head shot in the third half-hour as he and Steven Lawless clashed but the referee Steven Thomson forgot to mention the objections of Colombia.
Rangers tried only to hit the first half of the second on the attack but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly showed no concern from the Lassania Coulibaly strike and another Ovie Ejaria quick attack.
While Livi's 34-minute opener was on the replay, no one could deny they deserved it for the win they just had.
The Rangers once again failed to tackle another two strokes by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cool enough to take Menga for a little bit of a finish.
Gerrard worked on a break where he replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the change almost produced an immediate effect as an attack on the angle of the sleigh you made to Morelos but interestingly Kelly ran away from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to criticise the visitors for the kind of real game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long shot above the long ball.
Holt's side expanded their lead role in the final stages but McGregor stood strong enough to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow beat you out of the day.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had a last-ditch search for a juror in which he made an attempt with Jacobs but Thomson turned away.
Almanac: The Founder of Geiger Counter
And now it's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years old today, is also thought to have been the day the geologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger built a method for recognizing and measuring the working condition of the reactor, a invention from which he reached the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A scientific source since then, Geiger Counter has become a reference in the popular culture of the time, where in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," the invisible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What is it in this world?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger Counter, used in the detection of soil resources, such as uranium.
As you wear these earphones, you can actually feel the action characteristics of the atom chemical produced by the reactor activity in the resource."
"I'm sure it's coming now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
It's a name that lives on in his name.
A new vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ problematic cells
A new vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ problematic cells and kill them
The vaccine can teach the body's immune system to recognize problematic cells as part of treatment.
The methods include removing the protective cells of the body from a sick person, implanting them in a scientific laboratory.
They will then be able to ‘see’ a nutrient that most of the ingredients know and then re-enter.
An experimental vaccine shows positive results in the body of patients with a chronic kidney disease.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the body's protective system to detect the problematic cells, saw her cervical cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a diseased cell, where they are fixed in a scientific laboratory so that they can "see" a protein known by multiple cells called HER2, where they are also reintroduced.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. Sankara Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that with a needle it will benefit."
Professor Berzofsky states that HERS "generates the size of a wide variety of cancers," including breast, cervix, lung and stem cells.
The method was used to take the cells and bodies of patients and "teach" them how to attack the cells of the pancreas and worked in the treatment of the initial type of disease.
Kanye West began to criticize Trump's detractors, wearing a MAGA suit, after his SNL appearance.
It's Not Right
Kanye West was yelled at in the broadcast room during Saturday Night Live after a noise in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would seek a stand in 2020.
After making his third song that night, called Ghost Town where he was dressed in a Make America Great cap, he passed on a silence over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've often talked to a white man and they said, 'How do you like Trump, does he have a gender bias idea?'
So if I were worried about the gender difference that I've left the U.S. since then," he said.
SNL first featured a comedy version of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Harassment Complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, it was Chris Rock who uploaded a small video of West's vocals on social media.
It is not known whether Rock was trying to discredit West with what he released.
Also, West complained to the audience that he suffered behind the scenes about what was on his own.
"They attacked me in the back.
They said, 'You're going to go out there.'
They have oppressed me.
And they said, 'I'm a green man,' as the Washington Examiner put it.
West continued: Do you want you to see the green workplace? saying "I'm going to put on my big hat, because it means you won't tell us what to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try the love."
His comments have been heard at least twice by the audience and members who have appeared on SNL have expressed outrage, according to Variety's report, with one person there saying to the publication: "Overall, the studio is quiet."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West surprised a lot of people by singing an Ilove It song, which he dressed up like a Perrier pendant.
West had the support of TRUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who said on Twitter: "To one of the most influential people in the world: WE WANT YOU TO BE GIVEN THANKFULLY NOT TO SHOW YOURSELF AWAY."
But host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that only West "shows how it is and that's a very interesting thing."
"But I choose not to give away to someone (by buying his music or stuff or showing support for his 'wisdom') who I believe is spreading propaganda that is harmful to my community.
He's got freedom
She added, "That's the way a believer is."
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "someone who used to know me as Kanye West."
He wasn't the first singer to change his name and follow their band Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His brother rapper Snoop Dogg used to have the name Snoop Lion and then the famous singer Prince, changing his name to another brand and singer who was previously known as Prince.
Charged for attempted knife-throwing at a food stall in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a grocery store in East Belfast on Friday.
It happened in Ballyhackamore, the police engine.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.

Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, is set to star
Kit Harington is known for her role in Turning the Sword as Jon Snow in the HBO thriller series The Age of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old producer criticized the male protagonist's love, saying that the genre of drama meant that young children usually felt like they had to be rushed before they were respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'some mistake has occurred' and asked how to solve the problem of male genital mutilation during the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who soon married the star of the movie Game of Thrones announcer Rose Leslie, also 31, confirmed he felt 'very strongly' about tackling the issue.
I'm feeling very, very strong in my body, at this moment - where did we go wrong with the idea of a man's penis?
What do we teach men as they grow up, given the problem we're seeing right now?"
Kit believed every television would be entitled to the development of this myth by the male skeleton because of the male-sized actors being released.
He continued: "What is the human body and what is it taught?
What is being taught on television, and on the street, that makes young children feel like they have to be on someone else's side?
I feel this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change this?
It's obviously something that's bad for the kids."
In a double he also confirmed that he would no longer be making the film Game of Thrones during a row-series of films that came to an end in an abrupt future, saying he's 'still on the battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will appear in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a gun thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers dating his wife Rose to be the best thing he has come out of the movie Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this program, so in this way he gave me my family for the future, and life will start from here," he said.
Rose appeared in Ygritte, Kit's romantic interest in Jon Snow, in this film that earned her an Emmy Award.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the courtyard of their Leslie family home in Scotland.
China's coronavirus outbreak: 14 per cent increase in new cases reported in the country
China has announced a 14 percent jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new infections are spread through sex, which has changed from before.
Traditionally, the disease is spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the introduction of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV through this route has dropped by almost zero, health officials said at a tarao in the Yunnan region.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with young people with dementia in China has increased by 100,000.
Sex trafficking is a major issue in China's gay and lesbian community.
The ban on homosexuality was lifted in China in 1997, but the distinction against gay men and lesbians is said to have persisted.
Because of the country's tradition of conservative views, studies have speculated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
The majority of the spread of the disease comes from a lack of adequate sexual protection in these interactions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to have land-based access to anti-microbial therapy as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters refused to accept the explanation that her employer had released the information of the GOP senators, in which he angrily called 'the worst of the worst' and 'the worst of the worst'
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday denied the allegation that a member of her staff issued a waiver of three U.S. Republican senators on congressional websites in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat has confirmed that it is the hypothesis of some "conservatives" being propagated by the spiders.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Endings, endings, and more bad endings, press Waters into a post on Twitter.
The leaked information is said to include home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Senate Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The statement was released online on Thursday, by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the sexual assault allegations against the person who was named to the Brett Kavanaugh High Court.
Yoyon came some time after three senators questioned in Kavanaugh.
Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address he discovered was linked to the Waters office" which released the information of a member of the Waters staff, machine report Hill.
This baseless myth is a complete lie and a complete lie, and Waters continues.
The members of my staff - whose testimony, statements of dedication, and protections have been dissolved as a result of these elections and false doctrine - have not been the cause of this statement.
This is a lie, a lie, a lie, and a lie.
Waters' remarks were echoed online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
It's an insatiable feeling in Fletcher's words.
This does not imply that she would be a member of the
When someone is accused of doing something they did not do, they must not be offended.
They don't need to be committed
They do not have to question the defendant's motives.
They need to be calm and collected."
Fleischer comes out to describe Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was said to have seemed very distraught at the hearing of Thursday's episode.
Omar Navarro, a candidate seeking to seize the Waters seat in the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted her to "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these selective complaints.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified, she continues, "and will be seized with the right to act for all their corrupting and harmful actions to all and all members of my staff."
Johnny English is back in the spotlight - Atkinson's most powerful spy novel
Now it's a tradition to look at the benefits of Brexit in any film with a British character and that doesn't mean it's going to run for that Johnny English remake - which was started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be reasonable to say that we are the new country with the right to import goods?
In any case, the eye comes out for Johnny English's plastic face that he couldn't afford to get his license to design new things for a second term - that his own name implies something more than anything that it's another invention of a wide-ranging game designed for cinemagoers in places that don't speak English.
He's actually a spy, despite the fact that he's showing some sort of style to lighten the look that makes Clouseau's son, Mr. Bean's co-worker, and another work by this man contributing as a monologue to the soundtrack of the Chariots of Fire at the opening of the 2012 Olympics in London.
And it's also a classic based on Travelers and the iconic national character Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving a tension in his wake.
There are one or two good things in this new version of JE.
I love the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter when he wears clothes in the armor of a certain era and the rotor blades are worn on his bowl cap.
Atkinson's art of comedy is often portrayed literally in public, but the irony seems to be that she's not very strong and well-organized, especially when it comes to looking at popular "non-play" films such as 007 genres and Mission Impossible themselves they now have the courage to produce comedy as their own tastes.
It feels ridiculous as if it were attributed to children rather than adults, and to me the terrible thing that Johnny English saw was that they were no longer a figment of the imagination and faced off against Atkinson's ship in Bean's character.
What is being said of the conversation is that the Great Britain is in the midst of a great upheaval.
A hacker has entered the online network of the British spy agency, revealing the testimony of all British agents in the department, in disgrace of the acting agent - a young woman who is being frustrated with Kevin Eldon's small work.
It's the ultimate problem for a prime minister who feels self-centered and prone to temptation, already in the throes of a meltdown by a lack of political willpower: Emma Thompson has done what she's capable of with such a non-Teresa May attitude but not much else in the operating system.
The counselors told her that almost every spy had been destroyed, she had to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, now working as a school teacher in a good institution, but leaving lessons in how to become a spy: some good gags here, as English provides a bit of a lesson of spying in a different genre.
English was drawn back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant on the Bough side, performed on Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with a naval commander, a sort of unpleasant role model in which Vicki Pepperdine becomes a bit of a waste of time.
So Batman and Robin are making a terrible mistake on the Queen's Secret Service back to work, mingling with the beautiful plight of Olga Kurylenko's wife Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is failing miserably under the power of a billionaire technocrat who says he can solve a British computer disaster: Sinister Jason Volta, sung by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began to look at their systems: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French food-shop lighting; they created noise where they smoked themselves in the comfort of Volta's ship; and the English chanted lawlessness where it was an attempt to use a virtual headset and a virtual reality home for understanding.
All the stand-up comics have actually been removed for the final series, but despite the beauty and size of it, there's a children's television fan about the whole thing.
A well-organized middle
And I can't help but think: why would the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would actually do justice to his wisdom?
Labour has refused to allow Britons to work for four days a week but to be paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will be looking at a big plan that will see Britons working four days a week - but get paid five days a week.
According to the report, the party wants the leaders of the company to hand over the money saved through the Non-Indigenous Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them an additional day off.
He'll see employees enjoying another three-day weekend - but they'll still get the kind of money they're paid for.
The sources said the wisdom would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into what the workers wanted.
The move to a four-day week has earned the approval of the National Council of Workers as a way for workers to benefit from a shift in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A review of the plan is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a fitting rallying point in the party's path to economic restructuring for the worker and even for the party's overall strategy to face industry."
The Labour Party will not be the first to agree to such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, the Labour Party has not shown a complete lack of interest.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's intention and the party also considers it."
Lesser cancelerator John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to show what he was looking forward to for a revolution of socialist ideology in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was ready to seize control of "hidden assets" and "profitable" in public utility companies.
Small-scale schemes also mean investors now in water companies will not generally get back what they put in altogether because a Labour government may be able to 'reduce' on the grounds of what is deemed inappropriate.
He also confirmed plans to get employees in the company's board and create a Non-Profit Account to give 10 percent of the equity of the business segment to employees, who can earn annual profits of up to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy have told "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's preliminary investigation into Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on the nominee to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the outcome of the commission's investigation would draw any Republican senators into their favor.
In a televised interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could do anything to change their minds.
Kennedy described it as no more a cover-up than his colleague from South Carolina.
I mean, of course, Kennedy.
"I said, 'I'm going to go to the bathroom,' and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and he calmed down, and I said, 'What have you done?'
He was clean, well-prepared, and not shaken."
Graham's election, however, appeared to be ready to be made.
"My heart is set on Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take a big hit," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it very well," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who has a name falls short of his name.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the International Women's Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the International Citizens' Day, an annual music festival that has a huge impact that will showcase the stars who will perform an exciting mission to end poverty as well.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Day will see thousands of people flocking to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy players like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a self-aware call for the festival's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The International People's Day, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Action on Poverty, a nationwide movement that hopes to end poverty by reducing the number of people fighting so hard against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the service (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), attendees must complete a series of long-term activities, or "activities" such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, print a phone call or any other means to help the self-awareness of their ultimate goal.
But how did it take 12 years for the Nationals of the World to achieve their goal?
Is the wisdom of putting people through a free concert is a good way to get people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another way of thinking "clicktivism" - people feel like they're really making a difference by signing up to an online petition or sending out a Twitter post?
Since 2011, The International has said it has collected more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing forward the various goals it aims to achieve.
He said that these projects have helped attract world leaders to announce pledges and commitments that amount to a total of $37 billion planned to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people worldwide by 2030.
In early 2018, the group brought 390 pledges and announcements from its operations, where at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
Gungun estimates the revenue generated has directly impacted about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most significant contributions include the Global Nutrition Trust, a UK-based consortium of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow up in what they can do best," and a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4 million tweets.
With support from UK government sponsors, sponsors, national governments, and International Citizens just like you, we can turn the social injustice of low-fat diets into a landmark, the ambassador of the Food Power at the 2018 Hunger Games Tracey Ullman said at a public event.
The crowd also said after taking over 5,000 jobs calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced spending for another project, the Healthy Eating Capacity, which will reach 5 million women and children and nutritional support.
In response to one of the leaked questions on her website she asks the question "What makes you think we are going to end extreme poverty?"
The world’s citizens have responded: It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall short.
But, like the great civil rights struggle and the anti-racism struggle that came before us, we will win, because we are so strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the cast to play at this year's gala in New York, which will be directed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy will use naval forces to "disappear" to prevent the exit of lost supplies - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke suggested that Russia's entry into Syria - where it is said to be operating because of an invitation by the government known to have made it - was a ploy to seek out new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to have energy just like they did in Eastern Europe, the southernmost part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"The United States has the power, with our navy, to secure open sea routes, and, if it catches on, at its base, to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke is addressing attendees at a conference organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that resembles the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He described Washington's approach to Russia's relations with Iran, since they were the same.
"The economic zone against Iran and Russia is, more or less, benefiting from the replacement of oil," he said, while referring to Russia as a "combination of cash" with an economy based on fossil fuels.
The comments came at a time when the Trump administration, since it began working on a goal to improve the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, has replaced Russia, the cheapest option for consumers in Europe.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "industry."
Moscow further stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a true economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's main opposition to this project was economically motivated and that it was an example of an unfair game.
"I think we have an idea that energy will not be the right pressure equipment if consumers choose its suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action drew a response from Germany, which confirmed the launch of the project.
The German industrial giant, the German Confederation of Industry (BDI) has called on the United States to halt the EU's energy policy and the joint Berlin-Moscow agreement.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our electricity," Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), said after a meeting last week between German President Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Elizabeth Warren will have a 'good review' for standing for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would have a "good review" of her presidential candidacy after the midterm election.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made sure that she would contest.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the fallacy of our government and that includes the women up there," she said.
"After November 6, I will take a good look at the presidential race."
Warren accused President Donald Trump in the House of Commons, saying he was "ruling the country in the wrong way.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has long been critical of Trump and his Representative to the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We really need an FBI investigation before the election."
A result of an election released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren locals not thinking about running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" Massachusetts male MPs said she was a candidate, according to the election of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston International Elections.
Thirty-two percent supported the proposal.
The results of the election showed the strongest support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent in favor of his disenfranchisement.
Some of the leading Democrats discussed the possibility of running in 2020 including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin launches her PTSD track record at Donald Trump's event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is in, what he is recovering from, I can relate to other families who are feeling overwhelmed about PTSD and some of the trauma that the military is bringing back," she told the people at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the prison a "Giving in a room" and said of her son and other soldiers of war, "they are returning in a different situation, they are returning unsympathetic, they are returning in the mind of if there is such respect given to his country by their fellow soldiers of the international and higher order, and by any security party."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, involvement in reports of domestic violence and gun ownership during drunk driving, according to Dan Bennet, Wasilla's Police Intelligence Agent.
18 states, D.C., to support the challenge of a new asylum system
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to the new U.S. order barring asylum for lynchings and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the district filed the amicus brief on Friday, in Washington in support of the asylum seeker's challenge over the system, NBC reports.
The full name of Maira in Grace v. Unresolved hearing by the U.S. Civil War Organization in August on the system of government of the republic.
She said the partner was "in the midst of a dispute over his children," but U.S. officials denied the request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys have likened El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide asylum seekers in many U.S. states, as states facing high rates of domestic violence and harassment.
The new sanctuary structure was overturned by a 2014 decision by the Immigration Authority that allowed undocumented internally displaced persons to seek refuge.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not address past decades of state, federal, and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that any claim for asylum be adjudicated on the merits of the case, and such an injunction violates this principle," the court's counsel said.
The authorities continued to emphasize the clear that the policies to prevent youngsters from entering the U.S. economy harm, saying that they can become entrepreneurs and "get the job they deserve."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration authorities not to re-locate asylums for those suffering from domestic violence and multiple crises in June.
"Refugees are available to those who have left their country because of oppression or fear because of ethnicity, religion, origin, or representation in a particular group or political ideology," Sessions said on June 11 of the policy statement.
Giving asylum will not solve all of the problems - or all of the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Emergency rescue effort in Palu as people's deaths intensify in a life-saving hurry
In the face of adversity, the situation has become more
"It's violent," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby at a place where they were taken to Palu.
"Every minute, the car goes to the hospital.
to the water's clean."
Residents were seen returning to their demolished homes, sniffing the products out of the water, and trying to smell whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged as a result of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who sustained a back and shoulder injury, is resting behind Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside due to the force of the Jiamamin incident.
Tears filled his eyes as he remembered the nature of the earthquake that shook up to the fifth-floor hotel room he had with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to prepare
I was pressed into the wall, I think, "Haris told Gammmun journalists, adding that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and it was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to her.
I think they're healthy."
U.S. president accuses China of 'opportunity' with 'propaganda'
A week after a Chinese newspaper used four pages a day to promote a closer U.S.-China trade relationship, however, the Chinese U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using U.S. propaganda and propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested that China was paying a daily fee to the Des Moines Register - the Iowa state's most-selling newspaper - after China was accused of seeking to enter the country's presidential election on Nov. 6, an allegation China has denied.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in the U.S. election showed that U.S. officials told the Reuters news agency that it was a new plan by Washington and the United States to pressure China.
It is the right for foreign governments to present advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a war trade move that has led them to the level of revenue schedules on each side.
China's first major economic stimulus package in the trade war was the launch of industries that would break down states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief agricultural supplier to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece on Sunday in Regista Des Moines, "is now slowing down on this abuse by using propaganda ads in free newspapers."
"In broadcasting propaganda, the Chinese government contributes to the creation of an American culture of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by paying for advertisements in the Ragista Des Moines," Branstad said.
He added, "In the Beijing campus, you will find no noise that will prevent you from understanding the different views that Chinese people are facing of the economic crisis, because the media house is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he said.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China has rejected the offer to publish" his story, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republican Women's Division of Women Voters in the Middle East With Kavanaugh Debacle, Observers Warn
Many of the older Republicans stood firm and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh while facing allegations of sexual abuse, observers warned that they would see obstacles, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The atmosphere around this was great, and many Republicans were in the process of expressing their desire to continue voting.
These things can't be traced back to them," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School in Syracuse University, told The Hill of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake of (R-Arizona) in the final leg of the FBI investigation could draw attention to the anger of voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the women's rights group, on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate Chambers as Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee elected to continue Kavanaugh's presentation despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who brought the report.
"Democracy and encouragement will come out in the message," said Stu Rothenberg, a political reporter.
"People say he was already in heaven, that's true.
But it can be even bigger, especially among women's suffrage groups, in rural areas and small-scale suffragettes, 18 to 29-year-olds, who don't want a president, won't vote."
Even before Ford's testimony made public her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court elective, commentators expressed support that they could pursue if the Republican Party continued to assert.
"This has been a major blow to the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee election or a final election or Kavanaugh being put on the bench, and it's about how Republicans handled this and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Immigration, a group helping to elect Democrats, shown to the media.
However, the Americans were divided over who to believe after revealing Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slight sway that you narrowly overruled.
A new YouGov poll showed 41 percent of respondents doubted whether or not they believed Ford's truths, while 35 percent were sure or certain they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied while giving evidence, while only 30 percent said he was in line with Ford.
After an expos<0xC3><0xA9> from Flake, the FBI investigated Ford's case with one suspect, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a sworn statement last week that Kavanaugh was in remission when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court's nominee showed his affinity to her while attending a party while they were studying Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the world wide web is planning to start a new website on the Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a program that will rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt's state-of-the-art technology facility, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid's open-source platform center.
Mining allows users to choose where to store information and what people are given access to information.
In a special meeting with Fast, Berners-Lee was delighted that the reason for Inrupt's production was "the rule of the world."
"We don't have to do it now," he said of the start.
"Now is the time of history."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "internet storage data" or POD.
It consists of a series of communication numbers, a series of to-do lists, a calendar, a poetry library and other self-guided instruments and instrumental instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same search platform all at the same time.
The amazing thing about the self storage space in the online store is that the user has full access to this type of information.
The company called it a "recovery through collected data."
Inrupt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring resources, structure and convenience to help create Solid for all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security system bought by IBM, a few employee developers worked on the project, and a team of coders on it.
Starting from this week, technology providers around the world will be able to create their own distinct point of view using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his friends did not discuss "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a change where all of their business model will go ahead overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a newspaper published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's purpose is to provide commercial energy and practicality to help protect the integrity and quality of building Solid's new website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revamped the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the course of a few months, Berners-Lee was a big voice in the inequality debate.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee would have been the founder and CEO of Web Hosting, named the Web Foundation and Open Data Center.
I'm looking forward to this new year's resolution, "Bernie added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 teacher honored by Victoria Cross
The great church of England once won the Victoria Cross Grand Prix during World War One and the gallant celebrated their 100th birthday in the city.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by an ambusher, and he did not know that he had won the greatest reward of the British army.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a fence in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "marked coin" in which the 100-year-old stone would be described as equivalent to receiving his grandfather's gift.
According to the London Chronicle, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very narrow and very dark mist to the fire from the field from the machine guns."
He eventually climbed up to the firing line with the "greatest hero" who led the front of the line before falling down the rifle alone and crashing down three armies.
Lt. Colonel Vann was killed on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I knew I could never be except something humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also wore a cello behind the parade, which was directed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "I really enjoyed the class for the part I played in the marathon" and added that he was a great hero who was shown the support and support people give.
MMA lovers slept sitting down to watch the Bellator 206, but then they got Peppa Pig instead.
Think about it, sit back and watch Bellator 206 but only then be prevented from watching the actual event.
The records from the San Jose consist of 13 fights, including six on the main card and were shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when the scene changed to Peppa Pig.
Some don't even bother to sit up until early in the morning especially for a fall.
One loved one stated on Twitter that the switch to a children's comic strip is like "some kind of sick toy."
"It is the government's policy that the station be changed at 6 a.m. because the program is not appropriate so they have to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, executive vice president of communications and business, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa aleden," eh."
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, has said they will work on plans to partner with British viewers in the future.
"I think if I think about reprinting, I think it could get rich," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we can't do that until our Sunday afternoon, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it's switched there are messages that are drifting back and forth and all of them are uncomfortable.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
No, it is a matter of government.
I assure you this will never happen again.
When it's done, there are signs that it's moving forward and backward, and they're all uncomfortable.
It's a sad attitude."
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Tom Daley's "Darkness" due to gender
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he grew up feeling better than anyone else because of his gender - but that's what gave him the talent to win.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "no one is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Hamadan Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights of giving some "fat".
And his father's presence made him unconcerned about playing the Olympics.
The presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
While appearing as someone special on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone was growing up because "it's not acceptable for non-publics to want men and women."
He said: "To this day, the things I'm hearing about the earth as well, and the feeling of something different, have been the very things that have given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so he wasn't disappointed with anyone when they discovered his gender.
The bronze medalist has become a great LGBT performer and used it at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask for more countries to offer gay rights.
He said it was because he enjoyed being out in the open without any interruptions and wanted to give some "fat".
He's the third world champion to say that falling in love with a man - American actor Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has become a bit of a surprise."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap was not a concern.
"If you don't have a lot of things to do over the years" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find a man who's ever had such a top-down career.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all the corners of his seat" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are some things bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
The Olympic gold medalist is Dina Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't believe he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their ticket to London 2012 - since he wanted to stay in the front row.
"I can't say that 'you don't get to sit in the front row dad'," he said.
"I hold his hand when he stops breathing and until he's basically stopped breathing and dies before I'm convinced he's human," he said.
The year before Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just know that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life - swimming in front of a local people's event at the Olympics, there's no situation more so," he said.
And he was inspired by the choice of his first song - Pride from Heather Small - which captivated him in preparation for the Olympics and raised his own fat and body fat.

Mickelson's record-breaking performance at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. striker Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he played in the 47th Ryder Cup, but must change his form to avoid disappointment as a result.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th edition, was captained by Jim Furyk who put the player on a four-pointer for Saturday's four-pointer.
Instead of being in the middle of the game, as opposed to the U.S., the five-times winning star shared the day between being a cheerleader and working on his online game with the hope of fixing what he had.
He wasn't standing in the derby even at the time of his departure, the 48-year-old was unsuitable for the level of the Federal Stadium's Le Golf Tour, where he was too tall for torture and violent outbursts.
And if the match itself doesn't fit, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, faced British top scorer Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the people of the United States, with four points below, indicated that they would start 12 individual games, rise and heat to start the game, then Mickelson's game would be a very important one.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own person, although he couldn't say anything else.
"He understood the importance of having it today, he pulled up behind me and put his hand around me, he said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He was very confident.
He is one of the most well-known and well-known actors in this organization in the past, and this week.
I never thought it would be possible to play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how the system is and the tree is the way we think we're going to follow.
He wanted to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup tournament played on Sunday.
It could end the Ryder Cup game which will never be an example of a high level of history alone.
Mickelson won 18 games, won 20 and scored seven, although Furyk said his presence brought some important points to the club.
"He's funny, stupid, charming, he likes to be rude to people, and he's a great player in the game room," he said.
"I think the young players love to tease him, and even, this week, which is interesting.
He's done a lot more than that."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big gap will soon be over
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew from experience that getting a little distance in the last few days in the match of the Ryder Cup was also difficult to drive.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led five points against the Americans but only managed to finish the line with their goal ahead in the most read distance, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we have a great leader in Valderrama, we have a great leader in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only," Bjorn, who described, after watching the 2018 Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to reach 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history of the game will show me and everyone in this group that it's not finished.
You'll be in full tomorrow
Go there and do what's right.
It's not just because you've found God.
We have a goal, and it is to win this cup, and that is where we will be returning to zeal.
I've said from the beginning, I'm passionate about the 12 players on our team, but we all know what's going on in the other half - they're world champions."
Knowing how these players fared on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm never going up against myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be different
Tomorrow is a different day, and it's a different day.
It's okay to be with a partner when things are going well, but if you're going out solo, then you're being tested with your full potential as a golfer.
This is the message that you need to reach out to the players, it's the drive that can drive your potential tomorrow.
Now, leave your friends behind because they have to get out able to devote themselves, and so on."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number one Jim Furyk would ask his players to work harder than they normally do at the federal level, including Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on the fringes of these major leagues lately, having been one of the few players to win the league at Brookline before continuing to lose as Europe pulled out "Miracle in Madinah."
"I remember every bad word," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, connected his players to the final day.
"We've got 12 games tomorrow, but then you get up and start coming up as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When stress gets in the way, it puts a lot of pressure on these mid-range signals.
We set our standards accordingly and put their people in the style we want, you know, we're trying to make a surprise tomorrow."
Thomas was given the opportunity to try to lead Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half in this system.
"I went with this group of people in this process because I think it covers the whole road," Bjorn said of his election.
Germany's new navy has been delayed again.
The new German Navy cruiser was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the modern Cold War veterans. but it won't be until at least the next year due to a faulty system and the price of snow, media reports said.
Don't worry Rheinland-Pfalz, who is leading the new Baden-Wuerttemberg weightlifter, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the supply chain problems have limited the zebra's share of the operation.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come as a replacement for the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was understood that they would consist of a powerful fire station, a range of aircraft and naval combat equipment and other modern technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic signature.
Some important features include the longer duration of development - new frigates should be used up to two years from local water stations.
However, the further delay shows the quality of the warplane - which would allow Germany to send a message of war power to the surface of the sea - they will have to be out by the time they enter service, explains Die Zeit.
The Aibun F125 Frigate became a big hit last year, when German naval officers refused to launch the aircraft and returned them to the Blohm <0x26> Voss reserve in Hamburg.
This is the second time the ship will be able to return to the ship after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons why it was returned, but German media reported the "scandals and hacks" that made the warship useless if it were deployed in combat operations.
The scarcity of Manhaja was as important as the crew of the 120 ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg.[1] Nearly half of the crew were former Bremen class frigates.
He also stated that the ship had a heavier-than-air type that reduced its operational performance and determined the Navy's ability to improve further.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons "was weighed as ships of the same type used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the poor equipment, the cost of the entire project - including employee training - is an issue.
About <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion was said to have been raised.
The problems facing new frigates have become important in the field of recent warnings that the German fleet's capacity is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the commander-in-chief of Germany's National Security Council, acknowledged that the actual ship was "a ship that began to depart during the launch of several aircraft."
The official said the problem had snowed in over time, because the older large boats had been stopped but the replacements had not been brought in.
He was saddened that none of the Baden-Wuerttembergs had boarded the ship.
Federalism of the Secret Life of the Bats
A new study conducted in a region of Scottish Highlands has the goal of explaining how bats are used early in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of the study will provide new insight into the behavior of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Scholars and scientists at the Scottish Peace Conference will follow the pineapple and soprano pipistrelles with brown and long-horned populations of Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
There will be a special audio recording feature on the outside of the instruments round to check the bat's behavior in all the ancestors.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile phone research using hand-held research.
The sound effects from all the sound recordings can make it possible to recognize the number of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A map and a custom report will be provided to create an in-depth picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on the nature of NTS, hopes the results will reveal what areas are most important to bats and how they use each.
This information will help determine the use of local management functions such as tooling and how best to manage bat forests and other species.
The number of bats in Scotland and other British countries has fallen sharply in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and construction work that affects the tears and loss of the living space.
Air and electric lighting can be dangerous, as do newspapers and other chemical agents of construction materials, and attacks from domestic animal shelters.
It's true that Jesus is not blind.
However, because of their tendency to hunt at night their ears are more commonly used according to their eyes when it comes to meat capture.
They use a well-tuned audio system to quickly detect bugs and their triggers.
NTS, which has a conservation weight of more than 270 museums, 38 user gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, carry bats and essentials.
It has ten quirks, frequent searchers, a collection of bats and occasional rescues.
The industry has also opened Scotland's first-ever single-reserve wildebeest reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfires and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten wildebeests.
What is David Thompson's best-selling book?
"We're in a very good area, we're in a good area," he said.
"We have old houses, old trees, and a beautiful residence.
But there's a lot that's unknown about the bats, so the work we're doing on this property will help us identify some of the things that our son needs to thrive."
He stressed the importance of the development of the genmagan before taking care of the property since the destruction of the women's shelter could lead to the death of up to 400 women and children, which could wipe out the entire population of birds in the area.
They do not want to be killed, nor do they want to be killed, nor do they want to be killed, nor do they want to be killed, nor do they want to be killed.
Elizabeth Ferrel, the University of Scotland's Ministry of Emergency Management, asked for people's support to collaborate on the relief.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about bats and many species of eggs we don't know how many of them are.
Ronaldo denied the rape claim while the lawyers were preparing to file a complaint against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called for a smear claim on rape on "false stories", saying people "want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were also preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he subsequently paid her $375,000 by covering her mouth on the item, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking through his Instagram video and his followers 142 million hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as a "false story"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is a fake story," said the five-balloon-or-five magician in the room.
"I want them to use my name.
That is correct.
I'd like to make a name for myself, but it's in the works.
"I'm a human being in peace and everything is kala," the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Der Spiegel over the charges, which they called "an unsubstantiated report on allegations by the private sector," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would sue for damages for "defaming his moral character, in the amount commensurate with the gravity of the crime, which could be the most serious human rights violation in recent years."
The scam is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a large Palm Otel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the thousands, according to documents filed in Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after that and told her "99 percent" a "good man" who gets an aka from "one percent".
Their documents claim that Ronaldo believed that they followed them having sex, but it was in an agreement.
Mayorga also confessed that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later by way of reconciliation outside the courthouse because she was "feared of reprisals" and worried about "disturbing people's faces."
The 34-year-old is now trying to turn the tide as she continues to face criticism from what happened.
Ronaldo is on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he joined Italy's top-flight club Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will never know’ to lose car manufacturers
The UK "would have known it forever" if it lost its post-Brexit leadership role, Secretary of State Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "unfortunate" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would sell part-time work at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
Japan's auto industry says the impact of delays at the national border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnston factory - which includes Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year in which 90 percent was exported to the rest of Europe.
"It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see the purchase of a call in our industry," said Mavin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Some UK automakers have expressed concern over a no-deal exit from the EU over how the cross-border trade would be, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would lock down its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what motorists say is in relation to the risk of getting products if Brexit is not agreed.
Toyota's control system is implemented on a "round-the-clock" basis, as parts are arriving or a 37-minute drive from suppliers from both the UK and the EU of vehicles referred to as sari.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border that the industry says could bring delays and insufficient parts.
Toyota couldn't hold more than one day's equipment in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the job would be purchased.
Mr Clark said the Theresa May investigation's approach to the EU was "originally designed to avoid these investigations in a limited way."
"We need to get a deal. We want to get the best deal that will give us as many as I said not only the success that we will enjoy at the moment but we get to use that right now," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The argument that is not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers is that we are fundamentally in need of to continue what is successful in the production of goods."
Toyota has failed to say how long the work will be sold, but in the future, they warned that the price will reduce the competitiveness of the industry and lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the spokesperson for the collaboration in the industry, said: "In my experience as soon as these projects are gone they never come back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have delivered the fair and honest process for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could have "an argument in a week" as the fight over U.S. Attorney General Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueler, who is investigating Russia's crackdown on elections, links between Trump's staff and Russia and possible obstruction of justice from the President.
Whether or not Trump will dismiss the adjutant from office, putting Mueller's freedom at risk, and fulfilling Washington's mandate in months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed with a phone recorder the story of him and Trump and the possible removal of the President by law at 25.
Rosenstein's response to the report
But last Monday he went to the White House, in a report that he was going to make a mistake.
Instead, his meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "like to drive" Rosenstein out but that the meeting was delayed until a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and a woman who accuses him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-time FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claims, which further delayed the congressional elections.
Trump's secretary of state, Sara Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "Not even that, it could be this week, I think it could be sold out in a week based on all the things going on in the Supreme Court.
We have seen and heard the signs of the times.
Some journalists will object to this statement: Sanders has not held a speech at the White House since September 10.
Chrissy asked me why.
Sanders said that the failure to make the speech was not due to a problem for the TV audience, "even though she said: 'I won't deny the fact that they have value.'
She then suggested seeing Trump directly as a way to increase the number of journalists.
"The president has done more Q <0x26> A peacefully than any president before him," she said, without offering any evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
The speech will go ahead still, Sanders said, but "if reporters have the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions, direct toh is better than talking to me.
"We've tried very hard to do that and you've seen us do it very well over the last few weeks and this will happen for a brief speech when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends a news conference or a press conference.
Communicating with the media is difficult.
In New York this week, the president explained why, he's often seen his right hand and the emergence of odd cases before he collects press releases.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to express their appreciation to the country and their willingness to stay post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months to travel until the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made efforts to meet the price to be met to meet the needs of EU citizens working in public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, to the extent of this grandfather's decision.
But the British government continued to make preparations for possible inequities.
I know this time I'm going to have to give you all a hard time.
That's why I'd like to reiterate how valuable an employee is in his contribution, no matter what country he or she is from.
Partners from across the EU, and beyond, provide valuable expertise to strengthen and improve health care, as well as to benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland has become a perfect home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is in a state of emergency after his injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has been rushed to surgery after his injuries on Saturday that cost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Organic Corporation brought the report.
Tennessee manager Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened half the time.
He went right to the side line and fell or he fell," Reed said.
Trainers and health care workers gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the line before placing it on the stretch and returning it for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/number of injuries" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore wet-wearer, is in his first season with the Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had five tabs on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his grandmother up to tab 18.
Buyers will be charged for the largest stamp duty if they buy property in the UK.
Overseas buyers will be charged for the highest stamp duty if they buy property in the UK with extra cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme.
This move will eliminate Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The impact of the tax on non-residents in the UK
The reserve fund expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year - to help the homeless
Cross-border buyers are expected to be charged for the largest stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - with more cash being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This step will be seen as an effort to drive back Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise to provide affordable housing and set out to create more stringent measures.
The impact of the stamp will be on your personal and company's non-payment of taxes in the UK, along with additional government subsidies by tackling sleep deprivation.
The additional - which is an addition to the current sealing project, including measures introduced over the past two years on two-way housing and rental lease purchases - could be as much as three percent.
The reserve is expected to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that about 13 percent of London's new building complexes are purchased from foreigners living in Britain, the price of the rides and making it difficult for first-time buyers to find entry houses.
Many of the country's richest regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who most of the time do not live in the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a petition to seal the deal to help the young people who owned their home.
He accused major construction companies of hoarding high-priced goods by taking land without using it, and urged Mrs May to leave the revenue on the houses to address "the problem of housing in Britain."
Mr Corbyn announced a series of planned home renovations, including a rental plan and an end to the "un-labeled" exit.
He also wanted to give the council the power to build houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate the presidency to restoring the British dream - that life is better for every new generation.
This means that the property will be repaired.
The UK will be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it's not fair that it's easy for people who don't live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes as hardworking British residents.
For many, the dream of owning a home has come a long way, and the unhappiness of a bad night's sleep is becoming more and more real."
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to run Scotland'
Sunderland president Jack Ross said his "pride" was to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is delighted to challenge the return of the North East side, which is currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He returned to the Bright Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren to return to the Scottish Premiership.
"I want to play for my country.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Voices.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot with my father as a child, and it had something to do with me.
"But I think that opportunity will come if I win."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland tycoons included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former president Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid of what these names might have formed in such a large group, after the fight against Barnsley's bid and Ipswich Town.
"What's important to me at this point is that I'm going to be able to bring the team back to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and products in this group, it's no surprise that we are part of the music industry," he said.
"It's not easy to get it there, but I can see my self as I've won here if I can get the team there."
Ross spent only three years in management, after some time as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' learning to manage sports.
He also helped Alloa recover to the third division, and again changed St Mirren from her role in the Champions League the following season.
And Ross says he feels better than he ever did while playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's possible that he's a hypocrite," he recalls, taking God's place.
"I really believe that management is better for me than play.
It's amazing because I've tried hard, lived a good life from the inside out, and enjoyed others' glory.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you can do each week.
I'm still dealing with this issue in terms of the problems and pressure of the job but management I feel right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, I'm feeling very comfortable being in a cage all my life."

The full time pint is 5.30pm on Saturday, the study showed
The heat surge has boosted participation in the competing British parks but has increased pressure on restaurants.
Restaurant and bar fare rose 2.7 per cent in July but dining requirements fell 4.8 per cent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, manager of the CGA business, which includes figures, said: "He continued to shine more brightly against England than expected in the World Cup in July, which followed a similar trend until last June, when there was a 2.8 per cent turnout, but most restaurants were more crowded.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the food retail trade in June alone was worse in July.
Alcoholic beverages and bars are more powerful with its varieties than restaurants that are less expensive.
Food vending machines also suffered in the daytime, but it did not reach the likes of restaurant workers.
People seem to want to go out for a drink.
In all places where alcohol and alcoholic beverages are administered the sales amounted to 6.6 percent for the month, and food less than three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst and lecturer, said: "These results have been consistent since the end of April.
The climate and the impact of major social events or events in sports have been major factors when it comes to selling on the local market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, to prevent a fall to 4.8 percent a year because it will be a severe headache over the costly pressures faced.
"The prolonged summer heat cannot come at the worst possible time for food processors like this and the time will tell the most moderate weather we experienced in August will provide the much needed respite."
The total sales volume across bars and restaurants, which includes the opening, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating delays in the company's exit.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Market is an eye-opener for British companies, the bar and restaurant industry that collects and analyzes economic data from 47 operating organizations, and an increase of more than $9 billion, and is the source of the industry's brand.

The fear of being exposed to sexually explicit material
Twenty percent of students say they have a "real" website that also shows parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - created a website that they Boyma adults.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren showed a rapid increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages - references and photo-sharing on Instagram.
The news has added to the fear that sexual information is being published.
Twenty percent of the children said they were working with a "real" clean site to show their parents, while they were private.
A mother who came into contact with her 13-year-old daughter's website secretly found a young woman begging others to "rape me."
The survey, conducted by Digital UK and School Principals and Conference Principals (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them agreed to have their own personal profiles.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's a matter of concern that many young people are interested in opening websites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice for players' at Scotland's governing body
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Commission's board of directors as the junior director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's best running and field athlete and president Ian Beattie has stated that this position is a great opportunity for those leading the sport to be able to make use of it at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect among the Scottish, British and international community, and we are sure that players in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in doing a voice for the players and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in his total of four Olympic medals and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to travel after struggling with limited blood pressure.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago I had a physical death.
I couldn't walk
Doctors say it's only time to tell if I'm cured or to what degree.
It was a grueling job but it made a complete recovery, relearned how to walk and today it's doing a lot of physical exercise!
Thank you for the encouragement!"
An article about the role of women's health in comparing women's health to men's health
A company of breast milk producers has distributed opinions on the web and advertisements describing mothers who are breastfeeding and cows being fed.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first body-mounted breast lift device," technology-savvy Elvie has delivered color music news ads to showcase the freedom a new pump offers to mothers.
The women's real mothers danced in their boobs to a song that included the words: "Yes, I'm sweating, but you don't see my tail" and "If you don't notice these aren't sharp, it's my nipples."
He continued: "Match him, mascot, I'm feeding the children, mascot him, mascot him, and I'm nursing my daughters."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's website, led to controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of data points, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with most of the comments showing the milk industry's "irresponsibility."
"It's a good idea to use the long-term
It is as if they should conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are abducted from their homes after their birth," another wrote.
Elvie's non-verbal phone enters the room in a mother's wetsuit (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "There is concern for the mother and the baby.
"Why don't you give your kids a chance to learn how to make money from their parents?"
Another added: "It doesn't make sense."
The others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she had found the song "sweet."
"I think it's a good decision.
I bought one where I'm still drinking.
I know the engine like a cow.
I was a little nervous, but I felt like it was real.
"I think it's a good idea," someone wrote.
Another said: "The prayer has a purposeful entertainment for women who are snoring (especially in the workplace or behind the house) and feel like 'dancing.'
"This is not an endorsement or a judgment of the media company."
At the end of the video, the women showed that they were dancing in the shape of a pump on their nouns.
The theme of this campaign is about research that women who breastfeed feel like drunkards.
Elvie's formfo however, has no appendix, has no wires or tubes and weaves into the breast-feeding wet, giving women the freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while they pump.
Balarin, a partner with ECD and parents commented: "Elvie's phone is a revolutionary product that fits well with the intensity and bad presentation.
By drawing a line between explaining women and cows we put breast tattoos and all the challenges in the spotlight, while pointing out in an interesting environment and how it can be shown that freedom and a new faucet will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been featured in the film.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appears to be traveling gay to paint Marta Jakubowski while using the model.
Hundreds of refugee children flocked to a campsite on the Texas border.
The number of detained refugee children has increased even though the border integration per month has remained unchanged, in part because of the lack of opposition to the policies put forward by the Trump administration that made it more powerful to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors were undocumented immigrants, and they feared having too much of their own right to remain in the country by continuing to demand children.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other local residents would be hand-painted, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior official of the Ministry of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the council that the agency had arrested several people who had sought support for the children.
The court found that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who have domestic support or supporters are in the country illegally, and a large part of those are criminals.
"We're going to continue to work with these people," said Mr. Albanese.
Seeking to process children quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which is standard background, according to the processing staff.
Many people will come out by calling a video conference, rather than a person, to make their case against the law, as a judge.
Those who are thought to be unworthy of help will not be returned.
Most of their children remain in the security house, most of them want to experience panic or shaking, which can lead to violence or an attempted escape, according to the organizers and reports that emerged from the recent system.
The consultants said that the victims were particularly disturbed in adult homes such as Tornillo's, a place where the signs that a struggling child is easily tolerated, due to his size.
They added that the return of children to the tent city without enough time to prepare their minds or to make peaceful gestures could not add to the frustrations that many of them are experiencing.
Sham tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘captain troops’ to withdraw without delay
In an address to the United Nations, Foreign Minister al-Moualem called on the displaced to return home, despite the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the country's foreign forces were part of the Sham, under the anti-terror umbrella, and "will be dealt with effectively."
"They have to leave without delay and without conditions," he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Sham, a place where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, with millions of people homeless.
He said Damascus would continue "this king's war until all areas of the Sham" of all terrorist groups and "any official who is here without permission."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Sham, most of them training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of the refugees, Moualem said the situation had improved for the returnees, and accused "some Western countries" of "unfavourable fear" that caused the refugees to refuse to return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"It's a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid for Sham will not be granted until an agreement has been reached between Assad and the anti-war movement.
United Nations liaison officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey's mountainous enclave we survived in the last major area held by the opposition in Idleb has generated a lot of political rhetoric.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey eliminated a major attack by Russian-backed Sham militants on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem however stressed that her deal had "clear dates" and expressed hope that the military operation would focus on the terrorists with a launch from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be addressed."
United Nations Representative Staffan de Mistura expects in the near future to convene the first meeting of a committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a national constitution after the war of Sham and open the way for elections.
Moualem issued the conditions that would cause the Sham government to join the committee, saying that the work of the parties would be curtailed "to revise the laws of this present system of governance," and issuing warnings of interference.
Why Trump is going to be re-elected for a second term
According to this strategy, Mr. Trump will be running for re-election in 2020 unless, as many Freedom Party members hope, scandals and scandals put an end to his presidency ahead of his time.
It's probably the most important part of "The End of the World!"
There is currently no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime-time index has grown more than two places to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" influenced cable and viewership figures of up to 3.5 million on big news night.
"This is a fire that is being drawn to people because it's not something we recognize," said Neal Baer, the director of ABC's "Designated Survivor", on the congressional secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the former comic book writer and author of "Just Parts I Don't Laugh: With Some Funny Girls on the Move to the Hollywood Men's Association", had another guess.
She remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
She said she would choose Mr. Trump.
What's the matter? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's laughing,'" Mr. Scovell told us.
There is a value in entertainment.
It is said that, unlike anything on television, news from Washington can determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, or refugees can reconnect with the health of the world economy.
It's a luxury that only a select few can afford.
And in doing so, it goes beyond being a well-known citizen when you see yourself on the six-hour panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "in-depth statements" asking him for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather-painted jacket at a cost of $15,000 ("a heavy load of value," according to Washington Post.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.

Foreign funding fulfills near-term midterm parliamentary elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a lot of money, thanks to the rebalancing of the congressional district that brought the two monarchs into a single seat race.
This new regional structure outside Pittsburgh united Democratic National Committee member Conor Lamb - who won a seat in a district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running with another Member of Parliament, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th Pennsylvania District, which is closely associated with the 17th New District.
The map was redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the boundaries of the older counties were attached to the law rather than to the welfare of Republicans.
The petition in the new 17th opened the way for financial competition between the major parties, the Democratic National Electoral Commission (DCCC) and the National Electoral Commission of the Republics (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after the matasten victory in a highly contested election in March of the 18th Pennsylvania County Assembly.
This seat has been in Republican hands for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democratic Party a bit of a hard time winning.
U.S. assesses El Salvador's decision to support China
Correspondents noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already witnessed Beijing, with a small contingent from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his co-conspirators sacked Trump administration officials.
Department officials have decided to return senior U.S. liaison officers based in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on this "recent no-show of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only nine studies were conducted on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, support for economic development.
The study, which included cutting off financial aid and cracking down on entry visas, would have a chilling effect on a Central American country struggling with unemployment and homicides.
While the in-house event was underway, officials from North and Central America suspended an in-depth meeting on the issue of security and economic prosperity to review this last year's event which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent refugees from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials stated that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively ending the sentencing of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to make a statement at the meeting, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of government intervention at the meeting, the ambassador said.
And three U.S. representatives moved to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or torture from Washington.
White House Press Secretary Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the full discussions of the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss them secretly.
Their information was corroborated by an analyst who was close to the government and spoke in secret situations.
Read History
The next shoe to be dropped could be that of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility of Mr. Trump's impeachment, which is now well documented in the public record.
It was reported that Mr. Mueller had turned his back on finding whether Mr. Trump's campaign had collaborated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
And if the Lord had not been gracious to him, he would have made a covenant with him, and would have made a covenant with him, and would have made a covenant with him, and would have made a covenant with him.
There are a lot of questions, and I mean Mr. Trump's fall can't possibly be the only one I'm looking forward to in Europe.
There is a choice to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long it can be fought a month at a time.
In 1938, German officials organized a coup against Hitler, if he was rejected by the American West and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the years of mass murder that have taken place.
Historians are alerted to such a problem, and democracy is necessarily driven by a lack of speed or delay.
The United States is currently experiencing a lot of fatigue.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot water since this paper reported that, last year, he secretly recommended to the president and considered his inadequacies to the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the account of the Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's new F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or untruthful - or if it is proven in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and evidence of dishonesty?
And all in all, we're going to vote in the middle for the legislature that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we take these tests, democracy will be in place in the long winter.
But I'm not going to give up the fight, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was converted to Auschwitz by this Nazi regime and who once lived in my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and after 60 years, she sent me to set up a Sabbath camp on a table there containing swastika.
With this as my legacy, how can I be a rustic in the future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is set to meet in Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their win over the Austrians, after scoring in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League's G League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from hitting the start of the season up to 2–2 against Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use this result as a youth to the big points.
"This is a good point for us because Villarreal is good," the 31-year-old said.
"We started the game by believing that we could find something and we survived one week.
We may have eaten them at the end but, in general, the horse’s ear can be a good result.
They were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were better on the side.
Wednesday is a big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but this will be a difficult one because they have a good result in the final but, with our crowd of fans, I'm sure we can push to get a good result.
Last year it was difficult, between what happened and my injuries and the changes in the organization but now there are signs of discomfort in place now.
It's a fun game and the kids are happy with it.
Hopefully, we can push now, put last season back on track and win."
Women can't sleep for fear of losing their retirement savings
Despite the fact that their study participants have an opinion about how they want to be treated, very few people talk to their peers about it.
Nearly half of the people surveyed across the country said they had talked to their wives about long-term care costs.
Only 10% of them talk to their parents about it.
"People want family members to care for them, but they don't take steps to negotiate," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Evangelization Commission.
See where to start.
Don't talk to your children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't appear to be known ahead of time.
You work with your counselors and your family to discuss who I have to take care of, for these selections appoint important factors to determine the cost.
Importing your financial advisor: The advisor can help you to show you the ways in which you can pay for those expenses.
Choosing a long-term care policy may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a young insurance policy that is financially important to help cover those expenses or self-insurance and your long-term care costs.
Get out your legal documents: Kill legal battles in the past.
Get a health care representative there so that you choose the person you trust for health care and make sure that the professionals meet your needs even if you can't speak.
Don't forget to consider the power of attorney to protect your money.
You choose the one person you agree with to make a decision about your finances and make sure that the fees are paid even if you can't afford to pay.
Don't forget the small details: Think that your elderly parents have an illness that needs urgent help and are on their way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, officials said, adding the death toll was expected to rise.
Due to the lack of network, security officials have not received any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake recovery.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster began.
Here's some information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrates 40 years since the beginning of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a system that runs more than 300 miles (180 km) of coastline on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The constitution, a national territory in the province, appointed an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
they and agriculture are the basic economic condition of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the southern edge of Sulawesi.
Paman and Donggala have experienced tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation company.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the mountains of the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes are frequent.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The Great Western Aceh Earthquake in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes occurred on the western island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, from Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed many small towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake in the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, caused widespread devastation and panic as people were reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami at this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake strikes Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a temporary state of disrepair.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of rape.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as interfering with reports of domestic violence, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers, on Saturday.
According to the police report, if a woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her car
Palin was placed in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 bond deal, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, in fact" when questioned, the network reported.
Palin faces three different classes of Class I, meaning he could be held for up to a year and paid $250,000.
He is also charged with a B-Class misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day jail term and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been indicted on May's charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with the murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic crimes, conspiracy and reporting of domestic terrorism, and possession of the weapon while he was at high risk in connection with the incident.
The woman accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in the incident by veterans' groups in 2016 after she joined her family's PTSD behavior from her work in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people have died after the quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications have been disrupted with the expectation that more deaths will rise in the coming days.

U.S. Attorneys Seeking Death Sentence for Murder in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City shooting that killed eight people - an unprecedented sentence in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used his local self-driving cars to carry out attacks on the machine and through the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, launching on pedestrians and bikers on his way in October.
To secure the death penalty, prosecutors will prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of an application for the death penalty, made in the Southern District of New York.
All those considered are subject to the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court charged Saipov with 22 counts of eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting dishonesty, usually prosecutions for premeditated crimes, as well as violent charges and the destruction of vehicles.
The attack demanded "critical and decisive action," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's approach as "evil, cruel and merciless."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, illness, and loss to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro
Five of the dead have been rescued from Argentina
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York enacted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to death in September 2009.
At the end of the 1953 federal execution in New York for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple were convicted of conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Six-Day War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he enjoyed what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he received a boost after the attack after viewing the ISIS video on his phone, based on the allegations.
He also demanded that the Isis flag be displayed in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal civil rights advocates in Saipov state, said they had a "temporary" decision.
"We think the suggestion that the death penalty should be sought instead of accepting a convicted felon to life in prison without the possibility of release will not overcome the difficulties of the common occurrences", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers have asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be wary of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to hold a rebel rally today during a protest at the Tory rally.
The former Ukip president said politicians were "hurt" by Eurosceptics traders - as one of Theresa May's representatives suggested she should consider negotiating with the EU.
A recent supporter, Peter Bone, told reporters in Birmingham that the UK would leave from now on if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to the reconciliation deal between the two sides suggests that the Pro-Remain Tories are embroiled in a no-deal Brexit in the city.
Fremiya is struggling with handling problems and her investigators have been preparing on the road in attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she push ahead with my efforts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the outcome - and force the Europeans and Labour to choose between her and 'rudani'.
Bone told AFP news agency that he wanted to "look at the investigators."
He suggested that Mr Farage should be a candidate and give responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit but we need to look at the pollsters."
In opposition to the EU, he said: 'We have not fought world wars to be humble.
We are your servants in the land of our enemies.”
Mr Bone denied that the proposals and public opinions had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to be wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was on the march, reporting: ‘I’m just saying: Frem minister listened to people.
"Researchers don't have a hard line with the public, and the opposition won't vote, without our party and our activists, who have vandalized the streets and made us vote in the first place.
Do not let God speak to you and listen to Him.
In a letter to Mrs May, she added: "Their prime ministers will continue their work if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told politicians that politicians must start a 'war on terror' if they want to cheat on the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the issue of how between us - the people - and the politicians," he said.
"They're trying to trick Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not going to let you go with doing that.'
In a message to the cheering crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
"We have assembled the military forces of this country that have given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we have become independent, self-governing, and proud of Britain."
Meanwhile, the Remainers toured Birmingham before making a two-hour tour of the city center.
The opposition leader has pulled out of the Tories' bid for Brexit after the group was launched on holiday.
Labour's Lord Adonis has given a round of applause to the Conservatives over the security challenges they suffered with the party's applications during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who have told us that they can have the IT system in one place and all the technology of Canadian universities, to offer a limit, for free trade without limits in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total sleep.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is going to do a "good" study to keep running for president.
U.S. Sen. Elizaberth says she will make "a good review of the presidential nomination" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November between him and Congressman Jaha GOP, Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts presidential candidate.
She was in the middle of talking about how she could run against Trump in 2020.
At Saturday's meeting in Holyoke, which was the 36th meeting of the Trump administration since Trump took office.
A member of the audience asked her if she was ready to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to reform our government and that includes the women above,"
The murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to locate the person seen in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde went in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was asked and admitted to being there, armed and armed with it, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any noise, and taken to a police station in the town of East Baton Rouge.
A 6-foot-6 child growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with a 10-minute start time of about 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds throughout the game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Cup when players give him a chance to win Sebastian Vettel
It has become clear since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes "the players will play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well and nearly hung Hamilton to dry during the defense of his position in the first two and invited Vettel to attack the opponent.
Vettel entered the front field and left Hamilton to join the traffic at the edge of the pack, something that should have been a decision.
Mercedes went over the line later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a drive on the property against a Ferrari driver who left his love interest in a good hold-up atmosphere after a two-way attempt to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off from the back of the grid and was in seventh place after finishing for the first time on his 21st birthday.
He then led a major part of the race as he held the raise to reach the finish line quickly and got a beating ahead of Kimi Raikkonen's fourth.
He later entered the field for the 44th time but was unable to increase his strength in the remaining eight seconds as Raikkonen came in fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a good job throughout the weekend and was so easy to tell.
"The team has been very appreciative of the number one pick," Hamilton said.
This is a bad sign
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of not issuing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president gave Ford's address before the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than stating that what was going on in the Senate suggested that people were "untruthful liars."
"One thing can happen and the good thing about the last few days in the Senate, when they see your anger, when you see people who are angry and tough and dishonest liars," he said.
"If you look at the release of personal information and they say, 'You, I don't.
I'm not me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Do you remember her answer... did you take out this paper - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't get out."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he added, as the demon pointed out.
Feinstein was also sent a letter containing the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and the document was released in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegation that it came from within the office of the document.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Zargin, I'm not revealing her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret," she said.
But her disapproval did not indicate that he got involved in the president, who commented during Saturday night's retreat: "I'll tell you something, this is a bad sign of physicality.
Maybe she didn't, but this is the worst physical display I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexually abusing three women, the president recommended that the Democratic Party use the allegations to meet their demands.
"They are committed to the rule of law.
You see the evil, the immoral, they don't care about those who are harmed, who are going to be harmed so that they can have power and authority, Mediaite reported to the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants for Dundee
The Dundee Stars took their loss to the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 tournament at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were first able to score two goals through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the level before Dwyer again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the goal that came in the ears of horses against Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals became their victory.
It was the third time the Elite League had lost to Adam Keefe, who later played Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the season between the two sides, with the Giants having eaten three previous songs.
Dwyer's opening came fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist and Beauvillier doubling the lead to two four minutes ahead.
A match that lasted from the start, Sullivan returned home in the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the assistant to win Cownie's ear at 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed that the Giants led the game in the first time he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the season.
The home team changed their style and Buchard replayed them with a strong finishing ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in a two-match final and secure her fifth-team victory in a final match.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure People's Lives on the Plane Have Survived an Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has also been hailed as a hero after his death to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people flew safely off the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many more were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Small earthquakes have continued to plague the area and many are in turmoil in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job building a tower at Maniara Sis Al Jufri International Airport in Palu airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was attempting to fly at the time, flew safely.
He walked out of the building when he thought he was going to die.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said the ruling could save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News's Australia report.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we missed it this morning before the aerobatics plane arrived in Palu.
"We've been hearing about this for a long time," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the deaths could cost thousands of lives and the country's disaster relief agency says access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that there may have been an increase in the number of deaths since many of the bodies were under the wreckage of the aircraft while the number of them could not be reached," said Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
A flood of about six meters has devastated Palu, who will be buried in the same place on Sunday.
Military aircraft and chartered aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a hospital bus brings the bodies.
Clean water is hard to come by
Small businesses are caught everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, president of the international Red Cross organization in Indonesia, told CNN: "Red Cross Indonesia is in a rush to come to the aid of those who have lived but we don't know what they will get there.
It's sad, but it can be done."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I order you all to work day and night to complete all the activities related to the export.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini says one person was missing after a plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said one person was missing, after it said all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that since Saturday evening, they have not been able to give the information of a single male.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The traditional boat helped rescue other passengers and crew after the ship sank while attempting to land at Chuuk Island International Airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events were hidden.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed on its river bank due to a lack of flight routes.
Some witnesses believe that the ship was passing through the speedway.
U.S. airliner Bill Jaynes said the plane had crashed into the ground.
"That's a good thing," Jayne said.
Jaynes said he and some others managed to walk deep into the water to open the emergency door to the sinking ship.
The pilots were confused by their screams, and he suffered injuries on his head.
The U.S. Navy said crew members were working nearby to improve the port and helped rescue it by using an air canoe to transport people to the edge of the water before the ship sank within 30 feet (100 feet) of the water.
According to data from the Flight Safety Center, 111 people have died in the PNG-registered airline crash in the past 20 years but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Investigators found the woman burned alive at night.
The judge suspended his trial on Saturday when a man accused of burning the Mississippi wife alive was sentenced in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an eye-witness and expert in the investigation.
He explained to the judges how he used cell phone calls to track down 29-year-old criminal Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who was convicted of the crime, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from some cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the west side of her death, contrary to previous allegations, according to Clarion Ledger.
When information suggests that his phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford shook his hand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "sleeping, because the car is in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
They only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's message, calling the contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The hearings will begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the judges later that day.
Hip-Hop: What is Hip-Hop?
Some three hip hop artists want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling in the music with positive messages.
The fast-growing genre, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has left it as a source of political messages and a solution to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make a famous hip hop that will restore their reputation.
Musicians such as Fugees and Common have seen his revival in the UK through techniques such as Akala and LowKey.

N.Y.'s Child Care Officer Reads Couple's Commentary on "Black Widow"
A New York-based babysitter has read the couple on her face illegally after an unsolicited text from a mother complaining that she was "a black woman too."
The couple denied that they had racism, that the lawsuit had something to do with "corresponding"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two siblings, expressed concern when it was discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black from arrival on her first working day in 2016.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaa Aaaa", said Ms Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in writing.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to see Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman sacked Ms. Maurice, stating that her ex-employee was an African-American, had acted badly and was expecting to be brought to the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid her day's wages and then sent home by uber.
Meanwhile, Maurice is reading the couple to pay compensation for her injuries, and is seeking to pay her daughter up to $350 a day for six months, as in renting the job she was considered to have offered, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, it's not that kind of thing," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's because of discrimination."
The couple again responded by saying that they did not show any signs of racism, saying that they should expel Maurice because they were afraid she would not accept them after they had committed the crime against her.
"My wife also sent me something that was not meant for the priest.
Don't be a victim of violence
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you place your children in the hands of someone you have been guilty of, even if it was a mistake?"
The birth of a new baby?
That's not it."
He described the addition as "similar," Plasco said that his wife was pregnant for less than two months and had a baby so she was in "difficult circumstances."
"Are you going to support this?
"That's not a good thing," the bank said.
While the trial is ongoing, the public opinion court has been quick to see the couple on social media stories, raping them for their behavior and system.
Paddington publishers are afraid readers won’t want to be associated with a talking toy, new letter reports
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's good to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
That her father, who had worked as a photographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book through a small doll, would have made it known where the book was not accepted, added to the 60th anniversary of the book's publication being "difficult and comfortable" after his death last year.
From Paddington, who described her as "the most important member of our family," she said that her father was proud of the greatness of his success.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not proud," she said.
"But because Paddington were really honest with him, saying that your son was a huge success: you'd be proud of them even if it wasn't.
I think he saw the success of Paddington, in this way.
Although he is his own creation and imagination, he has always been devoted to Paddington himself."
He died for me, and I was raised from the dead.
Her daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital in Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"I called him regularly because he said it was so bad, he couldn't get up," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to make her my grandfather.
And I did.
I said, "I love you, love you, love you."
I'll be with you soon
I'll be with you
The doctors, who had lost their way to keep her heart afloat, began to slowly degrade and to abandon her practice.
She died a few times before now and that covers the whole thing.
I just had to wait and see if everything was okay.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by brothers and sisters.
I can do it to calm down."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, so far so close to her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers—regardless of the tragedy she was in.
"No one knows," she said.
I fell to the ground and I cried every time.
It was hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I first felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
It takes love to understand it.
It's a lot of love for her."
Women's rights campaign to ban women from wearing face coverings
Two women who have lost loved ones to see their own suicides work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been doing cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call up for support.
‘Mrs Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to know how I feel," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Sydney, said her son was an ailing donor.
Everyone knows him with a smile.
It's like they're smiling every time.
However, he left the job before he died, while "in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother's body after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continue to be concerned that there is a possibility of a hit on the score."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people you can come to and talk to, even if they're friends.
"Be quiet and talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who had been an only child to Ms. Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he wasn't upset or anything," she said.
"Two weeks before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
It was at the base of the mountain on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he was not willing to share his sights with them."
She said his death was a big problem for them, but they had to work through it: "He leaves a hole in the family.
He attacked us.
But we have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's presence was suspended in the sky, because the FBI began investigating
"I think, if we can get something like what he's looking for - just a short-term, limited analysis - how we can bring about a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "disengage" because of too many political views.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They don't want to waste their time
The midterm election is five weeks from now, on Nov. 6 - if, as expected, Republicans don't make the effort, then they will be heavily criticized in their bid to tie the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was on the phone calling for senators, begging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who served in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI report?
The election will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will be able to reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will give Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the offer and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'retirement' figures fall under Kim
The number of North Koreans resigning to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took office in the last seven years, a South Korean law enforcement official said.
Park Byeong-seug, who gave information from the South's Ministry of Cooperation, said there was a decrease of 1,127 resignations last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that increased security along the border between North Korea and China and increased prices by hackers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most North Koreans are eligible to become South Koreans.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border by illegal means since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people have fled China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ, which has security codes between the two Koreas.
China considers those who have resigned as illegal immigrants, rather than refugees, to be repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on a nuclear-armed truce.
This came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to a deal that would lead to the country's division of nuclear weapons.
After a June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to sign an agreement for the use of the Northeastern Republic of Congo.
He said, "Without the confidence of the United States, we will not have confidence in our own security, and in such circumstances, there is no way to destroy our weapons on our own," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny," saying he didn't gamble a job at the Supreme Court
House Chief Executive Nancy Pelosi, who called the elected member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said: "He is not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman ever did something like that, they would say 'funny,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh in the mood for sympathy dismissed the allegation that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both children.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed great compassion, at times almost screaming and doubting while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also publicly slammed the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a victim of terrorists, and a blatant violation of good morals", orchestrated by the rebels, outraged that Hillary Clinton had failed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi admitted that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he was discriminating against members of the Democratic Party.
"I think he has demonstrated his unworthiness with these comments and the kind of attitude he has had after Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi shied away when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrat won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not just a supreme court request that doesn't suit him, but also the court he's in right now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh's decision on the Tobacco Control Act or Roe v. Wade, as being castigated as a traditionalist judge.
In the course of the hearing, Kavanaugh asked some apologetic questions about whether he would quash some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"It's not a time for cheerleading, for someone who doesn't want to go to court and hopes we can say, 'It's not a surprise,'" Pelos said.
Women need to use it.
He's a righteous man, months and years of anger have passed, and he can't get out, without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's fair, you know?"
She continued, "I got help from a boss in a house, who said she was crying as she got angry, but she kept using technology that meant when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person talking to her, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm very angry."
Then she continued to walk.
I think it's a good thing."
I've made a mistake on the wrong side of the argument
One of the greatest memories from my first job, in a men's office dominated, where I once cried with endless anger, was an old woman who looked like a hard-to-find boss who I always doubted - pulled up to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
They didn't know you were angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they found you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for adultery in a boat named Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder was so frustrated, he stated that there was no reason he should have to expand the notion that he would then seek the presidential nomination himself.
"It's not a good idea," she said laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other contestants who were in the race, and all they needed was another one.
One of them called it "The Seven Wonders of the World."
Because he was late in the campaign, she was back on cash, so she promised not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
This is a war of loss.
She found that some of her fans gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do you think it's easy?" she asked.
When she made her statement that she would not be launching a campaign, she fell for the sympathy - thanks to the people who supported her, disappointment at the system that came with the difficulty of getting money and passing votes instead of representatives, and anger over gender - that she was satisfied with that.
"You'd think I had a mental breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalls about how journalists were pressuring her.
"You think Kleenex was a weight-loss scheme or something.
I remember thinking, who's going to put it on my grave?
"Are you crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a boon to Beijing
The goal of starting a trade war between the U.S. and China is strong, and the problem is not a stand-off now, between the two countries and could be a boon to Beijing for the long haul, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned early this year of imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and coal.
This week's high growth rate combined with an export schedule of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, so that one percent of goods coming to the U.S. from China will be paid for.
Beijing has retaliated all in the same kind, recently increasing the spreadsheet from five percent to ten percent in US$60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has promised to use the U.S. system to shoot you, and the country's economy isn't ready for war anytime soon.
Washington's decision to withdraw also means others are in search, but withdrawing to the United States in public would be more of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can print its cards correctly, the U.S. can support China in the long run by reducing economic dependence.
"The truth is that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that would depress the economy in any country becoming more dangerous than what observers had previously agreed," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-watching researcher at the U.S. New Security Institute, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who have committed themselves to return and appeal for help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
He said, “Today is the day that the earth will be filled with the fullness of God’s creation, and the earth will be filled with the fullness of God.”
The government has continued to renovate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore peace.
All conditions were now in place for the return of the refugees to the country had gone out because of the terrorism and the economic measures affecting their daily lives and environment.
The United Nations has estimated that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept support or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
The Ryder Cup in Paris
The European side won the Ryder Cup against the United States in the final of the 2018 match with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row against Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Denmark's captain, Thomas Bjorn, has returned to the podium with 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. hero Phil Mickelson, who had tackled everything in the game, threw the ball into the water in a par-3 hole of 16, leaving Francesco Molinari to play it.
Italy's Molinari Golf has shone through all the goals, becoming a 1-0 away win-winner since the tournament began in 1979.
U.S. striker Jordan Spieth has come out on 5<0x26>4 of the lowest scorers on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, an international forward, fell 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who played in the Ryder Cup final.
Former Ryder's eighth league player, Serbia Garcia became the all-time European Cup winner with 25.5 points.
I didn't cry, but I can't cry today.
It's been a tough year
I am so grateful that Thomas took me in and accepted me.
I'm so happy to be back again
It's about the organization, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said in a sympathetic tone after Europe's victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who launched the American Tiger Woods 2 <0x26> 1 football team in a Sunday match.
"The biggest pride I'm feeling, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career-long history with Ryder.
A stunning tally from one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 second-place finishes and only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled over the weekend to figure out the best ways to do it without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf in both games.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the game to his team, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had a cold in Europe.
We deleted.
He turned to Thomas.
He's the captain
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we will continue.
I love these 12 people and am proud to serve as a captain.
