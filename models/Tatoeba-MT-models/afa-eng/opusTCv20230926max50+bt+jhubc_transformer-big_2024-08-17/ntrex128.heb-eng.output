Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to look like Muppets.
Several members of parliament were alarmed by the proposal whose title of office would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was sparked by plans to change the name of the House of Repeals to Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people were concerned that “it will rhyme with Twp and with Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from the <0xE2><0x80><0x9A>Flyed Kamri party said all of his members were “unhappy” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his members were “open to suggestions” about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the acronym for Welsh MP) sounds very similar to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar way to the English letter u in the Yokeshire accent.
The House of Representatives Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation for name changes, said: “The final decision on the names of any words of description of the functions of the members of the House of Representatives is of course the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given to changing the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the MPs’ (AMs) role, the committee recommended the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in public consultation.
MPs are offering alternative options, but the fight to get a consensus could cause quite a bit of a headache for the committee’s chairman, Aline Jones, who is due to submit draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules to remove members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
It is the vote of the members of parliament that will ultimately determine the title of their role when the legislation is being debated.
Macedonian citizens go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the name change referendum, said he would ignore its results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem.
According to Mr. Adams, “older neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.”
“Now there are no bars and no churches.”
He said he could understand the disappearance of bars.
“People’s lives today are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not survive for as long as the heads of the churches expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves at the starting point again.”
He said the churches would be replaced by apartment buildings with shared houses housing people who are not of the kind that will help the neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that will hasten the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will join these churches.”
Both churches were built by white faith communities, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owners of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was handed over to a black community of believers under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Rev. Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the bell crucible.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Sr. Johnson and successor to St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played Kryon in July called it “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell crane in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the larger crane at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has taken place at St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the local church chiefs, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The assembly, which is the governing body of a community of believers made up of local believers, wrote a letter to the bishop in July explaining its concerns that the bishopric would “try to bring the costs” to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in recruiting architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some of the faithful complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old in Lobster Capture
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday as he dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing there with a group to help lure him ashore.
Hummel thought at first that it was just a shout of excitement about Lobster’s capture, but later he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that "his whole collarbone had been torn."
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Hospital in San Diego where his condition is described as human.
It is not known which species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Assinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s begins with a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store-style transitions with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion-a-year beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products continue to fall, expanded beauty transits will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets search for ways to use the space from shelves previously seized by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its supply of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also re-launching its make-up line – Boutique – so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will be reviewing franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second in Salley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores require retailers to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cope, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to battle the cheaper Aldi and Lidl chains with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has added Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since it acquired both chains two years ago, additions it says have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The network’s previous attempts to revive its beauty departments and pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacies within the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business operations at 281 branches to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the program by expanding the range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty products transitions to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice on the spot.
Our brand offerings are designed to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for buying beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has expressed “anger” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby canceled an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-clothing and accessories brand.
The joint business of the two is considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious that she had canceled at the last minute her participation in the luxury lifestyle brand of the two - to focus on her fat contracts with Marx <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted with "outrage" when the TV star announced during a tumultuous meeting on Tuesday at his business empire's Marlowe, Buckinghamshire headquarters that due to her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 - she didn't have enough time left to devote to the homewear and accessories brand.
The joint venture of the two is considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Wilby’s fortune, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his vacation homes.
According to one of the sources, “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
This was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlowe are full of products ready for sale."
Experts say leaving This Morning, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions as a result of huge investments in a variety of products, from mines and candles to housewear, and the potential for further delays in the launch.
This could lead to the end of long-term relationships.
Willoughby, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Terra Cap for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for the M<0x26>S brand and replace Annette McFarlane as a presenter on I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
It was a difficult conversation, and we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he gets from the news media of statements some describe as "unpresidential" and that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
Trump said in a “newscaster” voice.
"I didn't make any concessions."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after hailing their first meeting in June as a major step in the direction of North Korea’s denuclearisation.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “responsive response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We are in a good position with North Korea,” he said.
“We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: halting missile tests, helping to free prisoners and bringing home the remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his extraordinary approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing straight ahead.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they’ve been very clear that they’re not asking for international aid, so it’s a bit of a challenge,” Ms. Sompong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear whether foreign envoys will be able to travel.
Mr. Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if more international services were contributing to the aid effort.
In light of Indonesia’s incessant earthquakes, the country remains woefully ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning alarms about a tsunami in Palo, despite the existence of a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that sheltered in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s fragile infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Jocko is facing funding shortfalls ahead of his run for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the country’s Muslim majority.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets – using knives, bows and arrows and other household weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Stridge equalised at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from M<0xC3><0xA1>zquez<0xC3><0xA1>n Shakiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal and his team were down 1-0.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick at the far beam.
The ball flies high above the plaza and lands towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the goalkeeper Kappa Arisbalga, who jumped at him, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, get to the ball and players like Shack are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to create for myself as long as possible,” Soridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanta and I did one touch and I didn’t think about it too much and I just kicked.”
Chelsea led 0-1 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in the same game, before turning around in the middle of the field and running quickly into Liverpool's half-court.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick ‘give-and-go’ maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross-country kick, which led the hazara into the plaza.
Hazard was ahead of the defence and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left-handed kick over Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Stade San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Vidatoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, causing waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sotofo Porvoo Nroho told a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Bickenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Superintendent Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to urge anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on a vehicle camera, to contact us – as the footage may include information essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was found living in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who believe they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Meuse had just tried to enter his apartment, but was told that police were banning anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents were now told that they would be hours before they could return to their apartments.
A police officer is heard telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene in tears.
She comes back and mutters, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
Several police officers stood inside the scene directing people at the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously to Criminalstoppers at 0800 555 111 and indicate the log number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell’s Parliament Statue Becomes Next Target for Attacks on Monuments in Struggle Over ‘Rewriting History’
The removal of the statue will be poetic justice in light of the removal of the "Taliban" carried out by his Puritan supporters for so many cultural and religious artifacts in England
But the Cromwell Society says Mr. Crick’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s image outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The smashing of the Civil War statues in England was not done on Cromwell's orders and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of Sir William Hammo Thornicroft is a testament to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is the subject of ongoing historical controversy.
An indisputable fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure who represents one side of the opposition at the time.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector’ are also worthy of respect and commemoration.”
Deadly Pig Drives Chinese Farmer to Death
Local media sources report that a pig was attacked by a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his family name Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery covered in blood near the pig penthouse at the market in Lupenshui, Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shenyang, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead and found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that Bader found a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig attacked the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and dismembered,” said his cousin, whose last name was Wu, as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4.40am to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up behind bars to prevent it from attacking more people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Negotiations are reportedly underway between Yuan’s family and market authorities over compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, there have been cases in the past where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had attached a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer’s wife had driven the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood can be a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very inquisitive... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Will Cause Heavy Rains in Wider Areas of the Southwest
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Storm Rosa will bring floodwaters throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The winds in Storm Rosa reached a speed of 135 km/h, i.e. a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday 5 a.m. Eastern Time, the epicenter of the storm is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a Pacific Ocean is forming over the east toward the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical humidity that will combine with the approaching channel will create heavy rainfall in large areas of the Southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall in quantities of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
Avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong blowing winds and dust storms.
The approaching basin will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can cause debris drift and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain in the area this rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and rain will intensify and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This condition sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern U.S., moving from 27 to 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows prospects for higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, across six television networks, the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news bulletins in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had groped her body while drunk and tried to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the 20.4 million reported by the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen reviewed the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in offices.
For comparison, this is a crowd watching on a scale similar to that of a playoff game in football or an Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose commentators are enthusiastic about Cavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh’s appointment, he was photographed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing on the legal committee.
He stood in a humiliated gaze for several minutes while the protesters scolded him, all of which was filmed live on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and television networks all aired live hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by members of the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Cons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of being "playing politics" on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the idea on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson went on to attack her “demon game” plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU would collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely unfounded.”
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Deaton Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge police say.
Officials released a video of Simms' confrontation with Simpson, and police say Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to a report by WAFB, which is part of CBS.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail was set at $350,000, as reported by Advocate.
The Pathological Institute of the East Baton Rouge Department released an initial report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
Police have given credit to the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Crime Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the suspect's capture.
LSU’s athletics director, Joe Alva, thanked law enforcement authorities in the region for “harshness and the pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what they’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City.
Ashes ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
In the center there are a number of noises and vibrations.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash-covering on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police to disperse demonstrations, and thousands more joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists who were put up by the police to disperse demonstrations, egged the police and scattered paint dust, creating black dust clouds in the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes also broke out later that day when police were forced to use batons to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in front of the supporters of unity, who chanted “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that 14 people had been treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in the pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was judged illegal by the Spanish government, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted with a large majority to become an independent state, although the percentage of votes was low when those opposed to secession overwhelmingly boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent polling across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the National Police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different course.
Narcisse Thermos, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won an important, though narrow, victory in last December’s election, they struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders remained in voluntary exile or in prisons awaiting trial for their part in organizing the referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Foig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said the confrontation was sparked by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
“It’s getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail awaiting trial since late last year, announced he would run in next year’s European Parliament election.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the oppression that we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after car rammed into house
Three men, aged 33.34 and 39, were arrested after a car rammed into a blond house several times.
The incident took place in Bl<0xC3><0xA9>nagarg-Kresant on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Detective Bob Bellamings said there was damage to the gates as well as to the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired at the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingstone, who has just risen to the league, has stunned Rangers and coach Steven Gerrard, which is only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved up with Hibernian in second place.
Jarrar’s team remains unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season, and will face leader Harts, behind whom she is eight points behind, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending the home loss streak to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't had a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities with a weak host team
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they conquered a goal, with their directness causing the Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but dragged his attempts ahead of a goal, and then Alan Lethway could only focus his efforts wide after slipping in to meet Craig Helget’s head-butt ahead of the goal.
The hosts were ready to allow Ranger to play before them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host team to play free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touchdown and scored a goal from the center of the plaza.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but discovered that protecting the house was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained almost unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lethway touched a wide ball from another Levigston free-kick.
Cross-balls continued to enter Livingston's plaza and belm, while two penalty balls - after a pick-up on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one on a hand touch - were thrown away.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9A> Amazing<0xE2><0x80><0xBA> Livingstone - Surgery
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward momentum.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the leading position, but much credit must be given to Holt for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was formidable, and led a remarkably organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle on high alert all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspiring.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under Jarrar, they didn’t live up to those standards.
They were missing the final ball—just once they opened the home team’s defense—and that was a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at mending relations between the two NATO allies.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
From there, Erdogan continued to participate in the opening of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also voiced their voices, protesting both Erdogan’s policies and Germany’s decision to welcome him.
The counter-protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany praise as a hero and others condemn as a tyrant.
Car crash in Dumpford: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Stwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and paramedics treated the injured, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
City police said they were trying to identify the victim and notify relatives.
Instead of checkpoints and buses being diverted to alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a secure men’s prison, the prison’s office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m.
Special officers from the Tornado unit were brought to the scene to quell the riot, which included eight prisoners and was stopped to one wing.
Guards were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Israel Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their jail terms may be extended.”
Long Lartin Prison houses 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert in the southeast and bring with them a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already declared a risk of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to make a direct pass over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix posted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones remain in tropical storm status or tropical depression within 322 km of Phoenix since 1950!”
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm in the margins of the Arizona Mogulon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated places receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those who are outside the flash flood danger zone, the rain of Storm Rosa may be a blessing because the area has suffered a drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be of help because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, which is the second most severe category,” Weather.com reported.
First, the course of Storm Rosa will reach land throughout the Peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Storm Rosa, still in hurricane-force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause severe flooding.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then continue into tropical Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main threat from Hurricane Rosa, or its remnants, is heavy rain in Baja California, southwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert in the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and unsafe flows in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in Midsummer Norton's Excalibur Terrace area on Sunday at around 04:00 British time.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas.
The police are asking anyone who may have cell phone pictures of what happened to them to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the evil and anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s rudeness and shocking tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the evils, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his tenure.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw the brilliance and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a courtman with an excellent record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president addressed Kavanaugh's appointment indirectly when speaking about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Five more weeks to one of the most important votes of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m running all over the place to fight for great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are on a mission to “oppose and interfere.”
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away in huge waves that crashed on the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources said on Saturday.
Many people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carried up to 6 meters (18 ft) high crashed on the beach at sunset, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and didn’t immediately flee, and they fell victim,” said Sotopo Porvoo Noroho, spokesman for the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” said Noroho, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles per hour) before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Sub-shocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the north of Palo with a 300-km (190-mile) coastline, an area called Dungala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
“The media has completely collapsed and there is no information,” Dongla said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers were on their way to affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived as the warning was released.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on a high roof of a building can be seen shouting hysterical warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency did not immediately confirm the photo was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport is only open for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has climbed to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision members from Dongla arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers were sheltering in tarpaulins set up in the courtyards of their offices, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Dusba said.
“They told me they saw many houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of moving the transmissions of disaster relief, some complained that the arrival of experienced foreign aid workers had been prevented.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only begin to flow if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level disaster,” said Olya Ariane, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the door to international aid, but this status has not yet been declared.”
As the second night fell on Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing held on to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days, with her mother’s body by her side.
Gandon Subandonno, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, has coached two missing paragliding parachutes ahead of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel saw, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a veteran in the field of paragliding, I carry an emotional burden of my own,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the hotel’s collapse spread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who had taken part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray mark instead of a pair of blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brinks employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>runs behind a Brinks worker” and steals a briefcase with money to fill in an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not disclose how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that used to be known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been known by the nickname Ye for some time, and he used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, speaking about the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanye, which means one and only, to ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs became known as Puff Daddy, P.D. or Didi, but this year he announced that he preferred the names "Love" and "Brotherly Love".
West’s former partner, Jay-Z, also went through versions of his name with and without dashes and capital letters.
Mexico’s president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, “I will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities were pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence.
As China ramps up its AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements about artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. government does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” he told me.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be achieved in the U.S., he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence company, Face<0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the first-ranked Reversi player in the U.S., and later served as senior director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee has met in previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when you would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
“It’s not China that takes away our top academics, it’s the companies that do it,” he told me.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited stars from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
“I think a green card should automatically be offered to people with a PhD in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development program.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations pay U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Residents of Macedonia vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, residents of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greek territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists say the change will hurt the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 percent of the vote needed to be valid.
The question on the note reads: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union upon the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgeszewka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will obey the results of the vote to make it final.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority would be needed in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, the percentage of voters stood at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of eligible voters came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tanevsky, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko complete their ballot in Stromitsa, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on the renaming of the country, which will open the door for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament house in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kovardakov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents erected by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a straight head, not through the entry of the servants,” Kovardakov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us to Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian union.”
Prime Minister Zeev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zeev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “safeguarding our future.”
A survey published Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required percentage.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the percentage of voters must be at least 50 percent plus one.
A failure of the referendum would be the first significant loss of the pro-Western government’s policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through all of Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling broke through Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero seemed to take the gate with ease.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguaro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running for several more on Brighton's perimeter.
And then he kicked a left pass, and he found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch of the plaza to deliver the ball back to Aguero, who had beaten Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguaro has foot problems,” the Manchester City manager told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Possibilities the starting edge of the Premier League rivalry.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross-ball along the right flank to Leroy Sanna.
Sanna dribbled the ball before leading Sterling towards the far beam.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before he slid off the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim in a Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rain-Nakar Stadium in B<0xC3><0xBC>nsheim, Germany.
Cherzer wants to play a spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Sarr, who is very competitive, hopes to win on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the playoffs for the Rockies, who are leading one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least an open card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but have yet to secure a first place spot at home.
“Even though we’re playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will play at probably the highest level at any point I face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to deal with that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the start date for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Sarsar serve in such a situation.
Cherzer, who will be his 34th starter, held a Bulfen workout on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest - Sunday.
Washington's right-hander has an 18–7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in the 220 rounds of the 2/3 season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly hinted at the situation around his Supreme Court nominee, Bert Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election of our lives.
“It’s one of the most, the most — I’m not running, but I’m actually running, so I’m running everywhere and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing this happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the depravity.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “oppose and interfere.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and wicked and mean and dishonest.”
He named the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, prompting high-level public booing.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
She is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs told they are not wanted – and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against antisemitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, issues similar to those for which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on Friday’s meeting of the East Nottingham Liberal Party said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the general committee meetings on Friday evenings were exactly that.
By today’s standards, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy that has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was elected leader of the party, when colleagues who once thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree to – whether on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak in public—and it doesn’t really matter what I say—immediately comes an abusive flood of social media criticism with calls for impeachment, denunciation of the center’s politics and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I’m luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am thrilled by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of racist abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with every “no-confidence” decision or change in the rules of voting, the party becomes more problematic.
For the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud, and then I’ll be okay.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, outraged by the Thatcher government’s neglect that nearly caused my public school class to fall apart, I’ve been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need it most – whether as a local councilor or as a government kosher.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political views and the issues of my disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advanced the resolution on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not for Momentum in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of impeachment or political expediency will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air to the Top
The last two freshmen slightly tipped the final score, but there is no doubt that <0xC3><0x89>iree deserved to win today’s wonderful game in the Scottish Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeaten side of the teen.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as their much more risk-taking, that played to the benefit of the home team, and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve stood the test in our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robin Christie said: “Layer deserves all the credit, they took better risks than us.”
Grant Anderson's Trey in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the leading position, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes released to the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey who had not been converted.
Clemo raised Air's lead with a foul, just before halftime, he scored and then converted Trey Solo to a 17-5 lead for Air in the halftime.
But Melrose opened the second well and fresh half of Patrick Engerson, who was converted by Begut, narrowing the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knut, who was taken away at the gurney, and starting with the renewal of the game, Eyre widened the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, who was converted by Clemo.
Acting captain of Air Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's Trey who had not been converted, at the end of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Stroane Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Clemo without a ball, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air's forward mall.
Clemo Meir, as he did almost again from the game's return, after Kyle Roy S. kicked David Armstrong's box and sent the winger Greger Henry to the home team's sixth Trey.
Star Still Game looks ready for a new restaurant career
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to move into the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he was named as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and it appears that Kirnan is planning for life after Cryling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that cannot find a sea hopes the court will open a path for it to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters covered with ships in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to reclaim it.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody confrontation over resources in the 19th century is still alive – as is the yearning to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course he expects with a positive attitude to come,” said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will vote against the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s request that, after decades of fractious talks, Chile be obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic-born president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, hangs heavily on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But analysts say there is little chance that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor – and that even if it does, it won’t make much difference.
The U.N. court sitting in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, noting that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice came only six weeks after hearing the concluding arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated”, but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia’s claims, the last four years may even have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration in Bolivia,” Zarata said.
Morales’s war rhetoric has eliminated any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Velcze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides,” he said.
Clazadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says denuclearization won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the U.S. to keep its promises made at the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons that have reached a deadlock more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “a pipe dream” to think that continued U.S. sanctions and resistance to declaring an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid to agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps toward denuclearization.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, where it likely sees the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in huge hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
We will find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge, crazy headscarves for their SS19 collection at a fashion show that stunned the fashion scene at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats took over Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary creations onto the runway of fashion shows.
Valentino’s most prominent item was an oversized beige hat decorated with broad, feather-like fringes that covered the tops of the models.
Other demilitarized-sized accessories included decorated watermelons, a magician's hat and even pineapple - but they were not meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks – check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Hoot Couture.
One piece mentioned a snorkeling mask and glasses, and another looked like a melting ice cream cone.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement - their time has come.
Fashion commentators are watching the giant hats make their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter-diameter fringe on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The Calt label behind the very impractical hat that flooded the social networks spawned another great piece on the runway—a key sea bag almost as large as the one of the swimsuit model who carried it.
A burnt-colored relaxation bag, with the edges of relaxation strands and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline Le Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting big hats and big sea bags to come to the luxury stores next summer – because the design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the world’s citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, reinforced by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other areas of community practice.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a personalized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after field of study in school.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it gets into his head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the most recent tests this year, it can be seen that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students scored high in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers cited codes for filling vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, increasingly, language skills become essential to prepare students for future careers.
In view of the increase in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future due to this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically stabilizes a person in an advantageous position over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient for conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit number of speakers, 15 per cent.
This is why it is important to invest in language education for children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages considered most important to Britain in the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child’s field of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
It is undeniable today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season game against Denver Nets on Sunday in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
“It’ll be more than one and less than 48,” the Lakers’ official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six pre-season games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally hour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a flood of election rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies this week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As you vote to confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support for an upcoming midterm election, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer to this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and a week-long postponement of the Senate vote as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main purpose of this flood of rallies is to help Republicans facing a challenging November election gain some momentum.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign headquarters said the goal of these five rallies next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House.”
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as he enters the crowded election season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters, who asked to remain anonymous.
The rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbenko Stadium in Willing, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw press coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls,” said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday's only games
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon quartet games may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum pendulum is a fully invented sport, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think we'll find the momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so you can see a little bit of momentum in that,” he said at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with an additional 12 points in the game.
But Americans, as Spite says, feel they have a little bit of spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer up, not the last of them in the form of Spite and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Safith was deadly from Hetty to the Green and is a leader in personal example.
The shouts of joy grew stronger as his tour continued, as he sank a critical Pat to win a four-all-square game and Thomas dropped two after two.
His Pat, who won Game 15on, won a similar rallying cry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” he said.
That's all that's left for any of these players to do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more than a few points over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s undisputed lead story.
Europe’s strange but charming duo are four out of four and are all well-liked.
"Mollywood" were the only pair that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the potential European victory as the sun sets on the Le Golf National.
They're both better in different dimples at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Boba and Tucson Webb Simpson finished with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's Four Balls, when he robbed with Alex Nor<0xC3><0xA9>n.
The bogey and two doubles in the front nine lowered the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they were nowhere near coming out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the hole.
It’s fascinating to look closely at the four balls and fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading significantly towards the final day, but this fourth session showed that the American team is full of a spirit of battle that some, especially within the United States, have questioned.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe are in a healthy lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday with a score of 10-6 against the United States.
Inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Vernesko Molinari led the change with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who tried to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, and won two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To keep the trophy going, Jim Forrick’s friends need eight points from the 12 single games.
Fleetwood is the first European tycoon to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed “Mollywood” after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Ball Games, they continued in a miraculous harmony together to defeat weakened Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau with an even more pronounced score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning’s four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the quarterfinals to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, who are ranked first and third in the world.
However, it didn’t all go so easily for European players in the pleasant weather and light breeze that took place southwest of Paris.
Three-times winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a narrow 2nd and 1st win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Four Balls and later returned to defeat Fletcher and Rory Mclroy 4th and 3rd in the quarterfinals, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a negative four-point gap to the singles games, although as the cup holders, Furik's men only need a draw to continue holding the cup.
However, after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack appears to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says 'under no circumstances' it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen its mistrust of the United States and that there is no chance the country will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and technology again.
“But we don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions under no circumstances will we first unilaterally disarm ourselves from nuclear weapons.”
While Kerry reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about the U.S. opposition to a “rated” approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for taking incremental steps, his statement seems important in that it has not rejected the prospect of nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint announcement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward “a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, even resisting ‘an end to war’,” Ri said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>The perception that sanctions can cause us to kneel is a dream in the minds of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the heightened sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president emphasized in his speech at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that a U.S. missile attack on North Korea was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a set time frame for that, adding that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of U.N. Security Council sanctions must continue resolutely and unimpeded until we achieve a complete and verifiable final nuclear disarmament.”
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his recent visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea denounced him for making “gangster demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the U.S. takes “compatible steps.”
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wanted included security guarantees Trump had made in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches its participants how to sleep more, trying to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no clue when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassisler, a professor of sleep sciences at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham <0x26> Vimans Hospital, designed the course, which he estimates is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year of school?“
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Braira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a senior director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to open the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear and books – to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleepwalking routine.
In another section, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation may increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students overnight.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” said Prof. Zeisler.
He said the culture of pride in “sleepless overnight success” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
Worrying about enough sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep shifts the brain to starvation, so we’re hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zeisler design the course after attending one of his first year classes at Harvard.
He said the course illuminated his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Zaisel recommended that students check the possibility of setting a clock that will ring when it is time to go to sleep, and not just when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can violate the circadian rhythm and thus cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Manga’s goal for Gerard’s players
The Rangers suffered another attack of loss in a away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerrard's rebel players to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox players hoped to achieve their first win in a away game since the February 1–4 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team resulted in Gerrard's only second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind the racing team at the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers didn’t seem to match.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately behind Hibernian by a goal.
And he may be waiting for another Rangers Double after Can Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was probably thrown at him from the stands.
Gerard made eight substitutions for the team that passed Air to the semi-finals of the Cup in T<0xC3><0xA9>fred.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could have been satisfied with the way his players held down opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball in their hands.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Putman who kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player kicked the ball too far.
Keegan’s deep free kick then found Captain Craig the Hulk, but his defender Alan Lethway could only kick him out of the hole.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled in his favor after 15 minutes of play, when he and Stephen Lawless clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson waved against the Colombian’s pleas.
The Rangers were only able to kick the goal twice in the first half, but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily blocked Sanna Coulibaly’s run and Obi Ajaria’s weak kick.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute ran counter to the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by passing it to Manga for a simple finish.
Gerard did something at halftime when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the switch had an almost immediate effect when the extreme/winger inserted a bullet into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to force the visiting team to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and the lect continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to avoid a Jacobs attempt before Leigh was cornered.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton later had another claim for a foul against Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now stand from the Sunday Morning widower: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continue ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method that enabled the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a centerpiece of science, but in 1950 it has also become a centerpiece of pop culture thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Rogers: <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals.”
"Oh, my God, it's really blowing up right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.

The cells can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then be injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “motivates the development of a number of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke into a pro-Trump reprimand speech with a MAGA cap on his head after appearing on SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a disorienting performance on Saturday Night Live, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, “Ghost Town,” which he wore as a Make America Great, he cracked open in a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people who say, ‘How can you love Trump, is he racist?’
“If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the rebuttal speech was not broadcast on the show, the segment was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to roll on West in the publicity segment.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
“They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.’
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: “Do you want to see the dark place?” Saying that he was “wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?”
Try to show love.”
His remarks were booed at least twice by the audience, and SNL staff members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the paper: “A deep silence has fallen in the entire studio.”
West was added to the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West shocked many when he performed the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the masses.”
But current affairs host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply “be who he is and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>But I have chosen not to reward (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe fosters and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Me too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the entity formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dock, held the name of Snoop Lyon, and of course the renowned musician Prince changed his name to Sergeant and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Buliyaguard.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harinton is known for playing John Snow the Swordsman from the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old attacked the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that roles like this on-screen often send young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was “deeply troubled” about handling the issue.
“Personally I’m feeling very upset right now—where have we gone wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men in their growth period, from the point of view of the problem we are seeing now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for a rise in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters it portrays.
He continued: “What comes from the inside and what can we learn from the outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel that they must be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time — how do we change that?
There is no doubt that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequels or spin-offs of Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Beginning in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so in this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played Yeagritt, Jon Snow's love interest, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, according to official health officials in China at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection as a result of sex is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of the lack of adequate protective measures in these sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles estimated that the allegations were spread by websites and “extremely right-wing” critics.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters’s office and published the information about a member of Waters’ team, according to a Hill report.
“This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete lie,” Waters added.
“My team member – whose identity and personal details were exposed and whose security was compromised as a result of these false and erroneous allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete lie.”
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>This indicates that she does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they are not allowed to react with anger.
He's not allowed to respond defiantly.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused appeared to be too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
“Great if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her office had approached appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these false claims.
“We will make sure that the culprits are discovered,” she continued, “and that they are brought to justice for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my crew members.”
Johnny English 3.0: A Weak Spy Parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate for this revival of the action-comedy parody of the Johnny English series – which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will an ironic self-slap on how worthless we are become our country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the open-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English got another chance to mess things up—and his name stands for more than anything else, a wide-ranging comedic piece designed for movie-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the silly English agent who, despite his strange pretense of slick glamour, looks a little like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty of this guy who contributes a single note to the tune of the fire chariots in the opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also based on the mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There's a nice one or two minutes in the last edition of Johnny English.
I love the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter in a medieval armored suit, and the thrusters ring for a moment on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comical physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since the “serious” type of spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it’s directed at children instead of adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy, failed adventures are less glamorous and focused than the Atkinson-style, silent-film jokes of Mr. Bean.
The film begins when a great danger threatens the United Kingdom.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British espionage, revealing the identity of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the chief agent's apprehension - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Aldon.
This is the final straw for an arrogant and battle-ready prime minister who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Theresa May, but she has little to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the self-righteous Johnny English, who is now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: a few good jokes here, when English offers a school-rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant, Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man to a submarine commander, in the role of an “irritating class queen” on whom Vico Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Then Batman and Robin of putting Her Majesty's Secret Service into a terrible mess are back in action, with a beautiful Pam Patel as Olga Kurilenko's Ophelia Boltova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin with their Odyssey which is more than a farce of two clowns: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create anarchy by smuggling themselves into Volta's magnificent yacht; and English ignites a sheer anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to get to know Volta's inner structure.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but in spite of the lovable and playful, it has a sense of television for children.
Quite a mediocre level.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby the British would work four days a week – but would be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company executives to shift the savings as a result of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers in the form of an extra day of rest.
I mean, the workers will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same paycheck.
Sources said the idea would be “suitable” to the company’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The U.S. Trade Union Congress supports a transition to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “Policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Labour’s nominee for finance minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s party convention to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to bite back at the power of “faceless managers” and “price expropriators” in service companies.
It also follows from the candidate’s plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make “reductions” on the basis of misconduct.
He also confirms that there are plans to add workers to the boards of companies and create “college-owned funds” to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to workers, who will put in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy told the TV show 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into the Quano changes their mind
The FBI’s investigation of the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could persuade Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Fley asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in advance of the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the guilt had risen, and I said, ‘Did you do that?’
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, on the other hand, seems to be engraved in stone.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and there will be a need for an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Burt vehemently denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>And no one she mentioned could verify that.
It's 36 years old.
I can’t see how anything can change.”
What is the Citizens of the World Festival and has it contributed anything to reducing poverty?
Saturday in New York City marked the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending global poverty.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which is taking place for the seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will flock to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy shows such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival really achieved, with only 12 years to go before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free ticket to a concert really a way to get them to call to action, or is it just another case of “clickivism” – people who feel like they’re really making an impact by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, World Citizens says it has documented more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
These actions have helped spur world leaders to declare commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, he said.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its operations, at least $10 billion of which had already begun to distribute or raise funds.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British investor-practitioner partnership committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘citizens of the world’ like you, we can make malnutrition social justice a footnote in history,” Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the allocation for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with intervention in nutrition.
In response to one of their website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world” replied: “It will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and anti-apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows to be performed at this year’s event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to ‘sealock up’ to delay Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – which is being done, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding into new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The U.S. is able, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and when necessary to impose a blockade to make sure that their energy sources are not reaching the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leveraging and switching of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick corner” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost its heaviest natural gas exports to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 “unworthy” pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a strong reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Association (BDI), the leading organisation in the German industrial sector, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, it’s necessary for a woman to lead,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren voiced her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren sharply criticized Trump for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own constituents don’t think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “potential” voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by Suffolk University’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of running for the Senate presidency.
The poll showed there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent opposing it.
Popular figures from the Democratic Party whose name has come up in the context of a possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin celebrates Traumatic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump rally
The 26-year-old was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back from,” she told a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other discharged soldiers, “They come back a little different, they come back stiff, they come back and wonder if what they gave the country to their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other military personnel, is honored.”
He was arrested on Monday in the Alaskan city of Vasile and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under duress, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasile Police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the county filed a “Friend of the Court” affidavit on Friday in Washington to support a challenge to asylum seekers’ policies, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not revealed.
She said she was abused by her boyfriend and his violent, gang members, but U.S. government officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applications are filed in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems when it comes to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal, and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all hearings on asylum applications rely on the special facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier posed by the new policy violates this principle,” the affidavit reads.
The lawyers also argued in the affidavit that the policy, which prevents the entry of immigrants, harms the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work," they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“The asylum is open to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of political asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, as the death toll doubles, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said Risa Kosuma, 35, with a fever-ridden baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
“At any moment the ambulance brings bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, burrowing between water-soaked objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Devi Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the quake.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake rocking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think,” Harris told the AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Chinese newspaper China Daily in the Iowa State newspaper Dae Moine Register after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, claiming that China had rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to U.S. officials, in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a booming trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on goods imported from its rival.
The tariffs, which China raised as a retaliatory measure early in the trade war, were designed to hit exporters from countries like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important export of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday edition of the Hedge of Maine Register, “strengthens bullying by placing ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s precious tradition of free speech and journalism and advertising a paid ad in De Moine Register,” Bernstad wrote.
“On the newsstand in the streets of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers evaded the proposal to publish” his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republican Party removes women’s votes ahead of midterm election with Kavanaugh incident, analysts warn
While many Republican leaders stand with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him over allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the next midterm elections.
Feelings around the issue were especially alive, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward with the voting process.
“This kind of thing can’t be reversed,” Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday — they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while Republicans controlling the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
“Democratic levels of enthusiasm and motivation will break new records,” Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’ve been tall; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among floating women’s voices in the suburbs and among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their dislike of the president, often refrain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be a backlash if Republicans continued to push for confirmation.
“The appointment has caused the Republicans a serious conundrum,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the nomination, but also about the way the Republicans handled it and the way they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree somewhat on the extent of their faith in Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony to be certain or likely, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh to be certain or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was definitely or most likely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to reports in the Guardian newspaper.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed her penis to her during a party they attended at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Web to Beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the world of technology, is a company that will develop Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create a personal online database, or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify will all be available in one browser at the same time.
What distinguishes the personal online database is that only the user decides who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, the intention is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team do not discuss with Facebook and Google whether or not they will make a complete change that will bring about a complete and overnight transformation in all their business models.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the network’s regulatory organization, W3C, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: An event to mark the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Anglican clergyman to have won the Victoria Cross during World War I was at an event in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had won the highest British honor.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a march in Rasdan, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said the discovery of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the Medal of Merit was “incredibly symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his regiment and crossed the Saint-Kenten Canal "through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and submachine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and in the "greatest chivalry" he led the line forward before rushing to take control of a submachine gun with one hand and shot down three of the company.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to compare to, but something that humbles me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also assumed a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was “very honored to take part in the parade” and added that “the heroism of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to so many people.”
Fans of the Combined Martial Arts stayed up all night to watch Balator 206, and instead received Pepe Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Baltor 206 and eventually watching the main event is taken away from you.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main ticket, and was shown live on Channel 5's British Channel overnight.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for battle, viewers in Britain were left stunned when the coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were unimpressed by the change after staying up early in the morning to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the move to a children's film as "a kind of sick joke".
“This is a government regulation that says that at 6 a.m. the original content was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to the children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blattor, when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa Pig, yes.”
The president of Blatter, Scott Cocker, has said they plan to work on their schedules to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can sort this out, obviously,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is, on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We’ll only have five fights instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to give the fans more and we just went too far.
It’s a matter of bad luck.”
“Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Naughty’ Because of His Sexual Orientation”
Tom Daley, the Olympic water diver, said that as he grew up he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation – but that this feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t know until he reached middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The program’s regular host, Kristy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
Appearing as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "inferior" from the others as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of difference, were real things that gave me strength and power and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to grant legal status to homosexuality.
He spoke openly about it because he felt lucky to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple winner of the world championship said that falling in love with the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he said, “he took part in the Olympics for the first time at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you’d asked me last year, it’s all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.”
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breathing stopped and only when he really stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew I’d been dreaming about this all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, it didn’t feel any better,” he said.
That’s also what inspired him to choose his first song—Heather Small’s Proud—which he identified with in the run-up to the Olympics and which still makes him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., according to British Summer Time.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade the performance so that the event does not become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who attends the 12-year event for the first time and sets a record, went down to the bench at Jim Furrick’s decision during the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was his practice in games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won the major tournament five times, spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of repairing the ill he suffered.
Even at the peak of his career, the player’s performance suffered from downs and ups. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where long grass tracks are not usually forgiving for stray hits.
And if the competition itself isn’t daunting enough, Michaelson, in game nine on Sunday, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with starting player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the goal of the Americans, who lost four points in the first 12 games, was to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's game could be decisive.
Fiorrick expressed confidence in his player, although we didn’t expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” he said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and added a lot to those teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed and we thought we should keep going.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.”
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo’s record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves to his credit, although Fiorrick said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the dressing room with him,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There’s a lot more to it than the game itself.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage may soon be gone
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that before the final day of the Ryder Cup's singles games, a significant advantage could change for the worse.
The Danish player started his career in the 1997 Valdrama game, when his playmate, grandfather Balesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, whom he nearly lost by crossing the finish line with a minor lead and winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big lead in the Valdrama; that we had a big lead in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valdrama where we won but with a small lead,” Bjorn said in the photo, after watching the 5-3 win in both Friday and yesterday’s 2018 tournament, which led to a 10-6 lead in national golf.
“So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
“I’ve said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of those who are on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn was happy with his players’ performance on the difficult golf course and added: “It’s important to me that I never get ahead of myself when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It’s a pleasure to be on the track when everything is going well, but when you’re out there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is put to the test.
And that’s the message to the players: You have to make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, team captain Jim Furrick will expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the doubles, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furrick himself knows both the winning side and the losing side during the important final days of this type of tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team that managed to win miraculously in the final game, as documented in the film Miracle at Medina.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to be successful in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We prepare our squad accordingly and put the guys on the track according to the feeling we have, you know, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and will face Rory McElroy at the summit, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I chose the players in that order because I think he will be able to get us to the final,” Bjorn said, referring to his singles selection.
Germany's new warship has been rejected once more.
Germany’s new navy frigate was due to be accepted in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it was postponed for at least a year, due to faulty systems and cost being reduced, local media reported.
The takeover of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the fleet in 2014, but issues of concern after delivery have put a damper on the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships — which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas — will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Dee said.
The F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build a ship after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of critical “software and hardware failures” that rendered the warship useless for use in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors – about half of the crew used in the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The ship Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is twice as heavy as the ships of the same type used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes the training of the staff – also becomes a problem.
It is rumored to have reached a staggering height of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion)—beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s security committee, confirmed that the Navy now has “the resources of ships capable of deployment.”
The official source said the problem had accelerated and intensified over time, as old ships were decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be attached to the Navy.
The National Trust of Scotland Listens to the Secret Lives of Bats
A new study conducted on a Scottish mountain estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for their food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The research by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland will track common bats and European telephones, as well as brown and long-eared Devonton bats at Inberio Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located at key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A specialized voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat calls and which of the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of the living areas will be drawn to create a detailed picture of the scale of the landscape, of their patterns of behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management work of living areas, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects nesting and loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a risk, and the same is true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-detection technique to detect bugs and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 highly trained experts, who regularly perform surveys, nesting tests and sometimes even rescues.
The organization also established the first and only bat reserve in the Th<0xC3><0xA9>r<0xC3><0xA8>ve estate in Dempreyes and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
“This is a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But much is still unknown about the bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of testing for bats before performing maintenance work on the property, as unintentional destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and pups, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassment and interference with bats or destruction of their nesting areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish clerk at the Bats Conservation Foundation, encouraged the public to give a helping shoulder.
She said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mirage in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is suspected that he subsequently paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made, and called the reports “fake news”.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said yesterday was fake news,” the actor, who won the D’Or balloon five times, told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel over the charges, which they described as “unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions,” Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schretz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Miorga reportedly returned to the actor's room and allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Miroga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a “good guy” at “99 percent” who failed at “1 percent.”
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Miyorga also claims she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she subsequently agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “terrified of reprisals” and feared “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved this summer to Italian club Juventus in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will forever regret’ loss of car manufacturers
Britain will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading car maker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK’s interview with the BBC, in which it said that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Branston, near Derby, was “worrying”.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which makes Toyota’s Oris and Evantis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 percent of which will be exported to the rest of the European Union.
“From my perspective, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, chief executive of Toyota at Branston.
Other automakers in the UK have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its “mini” factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns have to do with what automakers call supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on an “exactly-on-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and the rest of the European Union, for the production of cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, and sector officials say they could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold more than one day’s worth of inventory at a factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production will be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers programme, detailing Britain’s future relationship with the EU, was “precisely calibrated to prevent these checks at the border.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the ability to continue using the successful supply chain system that we have at our disposal to date is absolutely essential.”
Toyota did not say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the extra costs would hurt factory competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Zuvalaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and serves as the president of the Unite union at the factory, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if the jobs are cut, they will never be reinstated.
A government spokesman said: “We have offered an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, on which much depends, could be “postponed for another week” as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of investigation by the president.
The gossip in Washington has been about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and get the president impeached through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he arrived at the White House and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was scheduled with Trump, who was at the time of Rosenstein’s arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, again rejecting the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see a postponement for another week given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will challenge this determination: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the frequency of briefings did not stem from a dislike for television reporters' "taking a stand", although she said: "I will not deny that they are taking a stand."
She then suggested stepping up Trump’s direct relationship with the press.
“The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
“Press briefings will still take place,” Sanders said, “but if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
"We've tried to do this on many occasions, and you've seen that we've done it on many occasions in recent weeks, and meetings that would allow talking to the president of the United States would replace press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during high-profile visits.
His press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason, in a release and sometimes bizarre appearance to reporters gathered there.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff from the European Union, employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express gratitude to the country and ask that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit have continued and are moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this time of year can be very worrying for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would very much like you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
University of Tennessee Tigers back-back Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Commodore's team at Vanderbilt University, Mike Organ of the Tennessee State University reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the margins of the field and then put him on a gurney and took him for further examination.
A University of Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred for surgery at the Vanderblet Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/scope of the surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He took part in a total of five tackles before leaving the game, and increased his total tackles this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative plan.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract new voters
Stamp duty hikes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s move to attract younger voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income earners.
The stamp duty will be imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra income will strengthen the government’s move to help the old under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher levels of taxes on secondary residences and rental real estate investments, could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new properties being built in London are purchased by foreign residents, a situation that causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become “ghost towns” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help young people buy a first home.
He accused large construction companies of stealing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing and repair Britain's "housing ignominy".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of “no-fault” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can buy homes with the same ease as hard-working British residents.
“The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his “ultimate ambition” was to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish revels in the resuscitation challenge of the North East club, which is currently third in the Premier League, three points ahead of the rankings.
He moved to the Summer Light Stadium after leading St Mirren back to No. 1 in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played one international game and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Scottish Sportsound programme.
But growing up, I watched Scotland play a lot at Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity will only come if I manage the team.”
Sunderland’s former directors include Dick Adbucket, David Moyes, Sam Allerdis, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foy<0xC3><0xA9>, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alois Athletic says he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>For me, success will now be measured by <0xE2><0x80><0x9A>Can I return the club to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as team coach for Hearts.
Next, he helped Alo<0xC3><0xA9> out of the C-League and raised St Mirren from the brink of the abyss to the title-winning position the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Polkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls, about taking command of Aloe.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>I really believed that the management position suited me, more than the game.
It sounded strange because I played well, I earned reasonably, and I enjoyed some reasonably high records.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with each week.
I still deal with them when it comes to stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint of beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in the survey
The summer heat surge increased the profits of British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused pressure in the restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: “The prolonged light weather and England’s longer-than-anticipated participation in the World Championships meant that July had a similar pattern to June, with pub revenue up 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more than they expected.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade seen in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages scored the strongest performance, with a higher increase from lower revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pub and bar chains, the percentage of beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the percentage of food sales decreased by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s lead data analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the out-of-home entertainment market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in addition to all the fixed cost halves.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August bring about a lull in what they so desperately need.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The sales watchdog for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with an integrated business cycle exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the sector’s benchmark.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a “head” account that they show their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that he keeps a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram” accounts — a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean “head” account to show their parents, but that they also have private accounts.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old teenage daughter’s secret account found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the School Principals’ Association (HMC) of independent schools in the UK, found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Aileen Doyle to serve as 'voice for athletes' at Scottish Athletics Board
Aylde Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Ilde has been highly respected by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from her coming on the board,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and really help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in all, and is now regularly a BBC commentator, has lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and now I am doing agile and responsive exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Milk Pumps Advertisement Comparison of Mothers and Cows Party Opinions Online
A milk pump company has split opinions online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the pump, which is supposed to be “the world’s first wearable silent milk pump,” technology company Elvie has posted a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in the barn full of hay to the sounds of a song that included words like: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you won’t be able to see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not udders, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus of the song goes on to say: “I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I milk my girls.”
But the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>A very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
“Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth,” she wrote.
Elvie’s milk pump is discreetly integrated into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: “Traumatically understandable for the cow and the calf as one.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?”
Another said: “An advertisement is completely disconnected.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “ridiculous.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I was referring to its content.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
It’s a funny ad for mothers who suck (often at their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like “cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie’s pump is completely silent, with no tubes and wires, it fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, Partner and Head of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother noted: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In creating a comparison between self-expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pumping of milk and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and to demonstrate in an entertaining, self-identifiable way the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has surged, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s discourse and policies have made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Typically, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that their ability to remain in the country would be jeopardized by applying for responsibility for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households would have to hand over fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanese, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors unsupervised.
The PA subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and many of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to pursue these people,” Mr. Albans said.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, the officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days as was customary under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those not found to be eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers said, and reports released from the system in recent months.
Consultants say these concerns are being heightened in larger facilities such as a tornado, where signs of a child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to emotionally prepare them or to separate from friends could worsen the trauma many are already facing.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have cleansed the Syrian lands” of terrorist organizations and “any illegal foreign presence” alike.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on its war-torn soil.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions for their return were good and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that motivated refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be sent to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is agreed between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian support on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had “clear termination dates” and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihad fighters, including frontline fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who would be “destroyed.”
U.N. envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, said the panel’s work should be limited to “examining the provisions of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By this logic, Trump will get re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberals expect, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In the course of which it will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time!
There are no signs of fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the “Rachel Meadow Show” broadcast on MSNBC, reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s the fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series Survivor on Purpose, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scoble, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Only the Funny Parts: ... and Some Hard Truths About Infiltrating the Hollywood Men's Circle" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scoble told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the plotlines emerging from Washington may determine the future of the <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Row v. Wade” ruling, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond the bounds of being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours on the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “Indiscernible Informant” as a source for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich jacket, “The Vanity of Washington,” to talk about
I, for one, would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which feels like a reality show, is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of History for Sale, about the changing crew in Trump’s show and the daily twists in the plot.
You can't afford to lose one episode or be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and recorded the CNN at the same time.
He was unable to disengage, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“I remember the times when we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right.”

Funding from outside sources floods the race for the closest midterm elections to Congress
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is facing a flood of money, thanks to a reorganisation of congressional districts that has led to a two-member race for the same seat.
The newly redrawed suburb of Pittsburgh placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another county, in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district division had discriminated against, and unconstitutionally, the results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a battle of financial blows in the campaign between the major parties’ financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, which was widely watched, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat belonged to Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators saw an easy advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held the hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the management team of the Trump company.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But the imposition of sanctions was only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included economic aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, could hurt a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all punitive considerations against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the government attaches to him, the diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, provided they remained anonymous.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on alleged obstruction of justice by Trump, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly referring his investigation to the question of whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election campaign.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body at the very moment he prepares to stand before voters again, and possibly a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with “if” and I don’t intend to argue that Trump’s fall is inevitable – not even for his European equivalents.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to prevent the resulting years of killing.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he had offered to secretly record the president and speculated on his impropriety.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair—or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is approved despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter’s sleep.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had also occupied my once magnificent house.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table carrying the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durance of the Rangers Optimistic for the Vienna Brapid Confrontation
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Team G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a stepping stone to better performance.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something and we got a point.
We could have won in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the standstill in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
“I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I’m convinced we can push and get a positive result.
“The last year has been really tough, with everything that’s happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there’s a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, very few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family for treatment if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Help your counselor and family discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your financing options for long-term nursing care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with an amount of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal disputes on this occasion.
Find, and from us, a health authority, a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that your professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure that you pay bills if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Specify these details in the written plan to be prepared.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>The financial side is not the only important point, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster cut off communications networks and officials in charge of the aid were unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area in northern Palu that was closer to the 7.5-magnitude source of the noise.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when a tsunami and an earthquake struck.
Dongala is a district extending over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the district, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, mainly concentrated in Murwali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and permanently damaged by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those killed died in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits South Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantawi Islands, opposite Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Fidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic, as locals recalled the destruction after the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the North Island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of Sara Palin, the governor of Alaska and the former vice presidential candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from the Alaskan city of Vasile, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disruption of reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan police forces.
According to a police report, when a miner tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-So Partriel facility under $500 bail, according to KTUU television.
According to the network’s reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, for sure,” when asked to lay out his claims.
Palin was charged with three counts of A-type conduct, and could therefore be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a type B felony, according to which he could be sentenced to a day in prison and fined $2,000.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under duress in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks have been cut and the rate of losses is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used Home Depot’s rental truck to carry out a bike path attack on the side of the West Side highway in southern Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who got into his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sayfov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the Declaration of Intent for the Death Penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be sought for these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury slapped Seypov with an indictment that included 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for aiding and abetting extortion, which is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant and deliberate planning in advance,” prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov carried out the attack as “despicable, cruel and sick.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Saifolo Habibulovich Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lor Dekd, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlig, Hernan Prucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pinocchio, “
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York filed a death penalty case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Seyypov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired by the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty to life imprisonment with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the People’s Army today during a protest at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics - when a Conservative MP Theresa May claimed he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain “would have been out” by now if Prague had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May, the reconciliation of the deeply divided ranks of the Conservatives, has been underscored by the fact that conservatives who support remaining in the EU are joining a different anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chakras, on track despite attacks from Brexiteers, Brexiteers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-reactions – forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her agreement and “chaos”.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to “break up with Checkers.”
He argued that Fragge should have been accepted as a member and in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: ‘I will defend Brexit but we have to break up with Checkers.’
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: ‘We didn’t fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Boone rescinded claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely false.”
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: ‘I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chakras program is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and among our activists who took to the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please leave the chakras and start listening.”
In a critical message aimed at May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians must be made to “feel the pressure” if they are to betray a resolution adopted in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow you to evade its execution.”
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
We call on the People’s Army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At that moment, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved conservative banners against Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the opening of the Conservative Conference for the security problems they had suffered with the party's app.
“These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all possible technology for a deal like Canada Plus Plus, frictionless border crossings and borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's totally ridiculous.
“There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after November’s election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts made a statement about her future during a town hall meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for the November midterm election against Republican Jeff Dill, who served as co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting that took place with voters in a meeting format at the city hall since Trump took office.
One of them asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and have a woman at the top.
Arrest in case of shooting to death of Sims from LSU
Police in the Louisiana capital Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during an 11 a.m. press conference held by ET.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of Southern California campus early on Friday.
“Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died of it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a gun and singing on Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at Baton Rouge East County Police Department.
The junior player, who is nearly two meters tall, played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after being awarded a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear, from the moment Voltaire Bottas advanced to the next level ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team’s drivers would play an important role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the first moment and he left Hamilton almost alone defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Vottle to attack his teammate.
Wattl set out to stop the intermediates first and let Hamilton fit in with the movement of the competitor's tail, apparently a crucial decision.
The Mercedes team left for a later stop-around and returned to the race behind Wattl, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel fight that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner track to hold on without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rankings and finished seventh in the first round.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a stop in the 44th round and failed to pick up the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Rijkonn took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to the double,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and despicable and liars."
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the ads and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document - <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep his secret and I kept the letter as secret as she asked me to.”
But the senator’s denial doesn’t seem to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday night: “I’m telling you, that was really bad body language.
“It may not be the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the evils, the vices, they don’t care who they hurt, who they trample on on on the road to power and power,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee stars 5-3 against the giants of Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee stars made up for losing in the elite league on Friday against the giants of Belfast and won the next game, 5-3, at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis in Willyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney put their team back in business until Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for the Dundies until two goals by Lucas Landvald Nielsen secured the victory.
This is the third loss of the season for Adam Kif's team, who emerged from behind to defeat the Dundees 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul's cooking, and David Rutherford cooked up Bevilier's goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In a busy first third, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked up Cooney's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead on the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first trimester.
The home team regrouped, with the rest scoring again a goal that equalised the power play at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the Danes a first-time advantage in the game, at the end of the second third, and Nielsen secured the Danes' victory with the fifth goal, which he scored from the half of the field in the final third.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes on their home field next Friday.
An air traffic controller gave his life to ensure hundreds of passengers could escape an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Genawan Agung refused to abandon his position in the heavily rocking control tower at the Motiara Sis El Joffrey airport in Palo.
It remains in place to ensure Batik Air Flight 6321 can take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower thinking it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air India spokesman Johannes Siret said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Kalimantan’s Balikpan airport to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palo.
“Our hearts are broken to hear the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach the thousands because, according to Indonesia's disaster relief agency, access to Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“It is believed that the death toll will continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible,” agency spokesman Sattopo Forvo said.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
“Mini-markets are looting everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, who heads the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crashes in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that all those remaining were stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“That’s a very positive thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency exits in the waist-high water on the sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to improve a pier also helped with rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the Air Safety Network (ASN) state that 111 people have been killed in the crashes of listed airlines in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors proved their case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of torching a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to put together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of her murder.
According to the Clareon Ledger report, Rowlett said he received the location data from a number of mobile phones that showed Thales was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Thales was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he “lied because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Thales said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Thales deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited text message from the mother who complained that the nanny was “another black man.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to learn that her new child care provider, Giselle Morris, was black when she reached her first workday in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a report by the New York Post, after noticing the mouthpiece, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, who was of African-American descent, had done a bad job, and that she was now expecting to hire a Filipino in her place.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for the dismissal, asking for $350 a day in compensation for six months of work and living in the place for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, they don’t do things like that,” she told a Facebook post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back on claims that they were racists, saying that ending Morris' employment would have been demanded, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had hurt her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your little baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and said his wife was due only two months before the event and was "in a very difficult situation".
Do you want to chase someone like her?
It's not nice to do such a thing," the investment banker added.
The case is still pending, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, dismissing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children’s book from a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about postponing his work, she added that the book’s 60th anniversary was “sweet bitter,” after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of the eventual success of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
“He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man,” she said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who was achieving something: you were proud of him even though it wasn’t really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called on a regular basis and said that she was really bad, that she wasn't expected to last," said Mrs. Adnan-Lapros.
“Then I got a call from Ned where he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say good-bye.
And that's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The meds that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and went out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's all stopped.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Ms. Adnan-LaFross, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her ordeal.
No one knew,” she said.
My head was soft, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had this amazing feeling of solidarity with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women mourn hanging on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Ms. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leideny, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
But he stopped working before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after committing suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about a chain reaction.”
Ms. Davis created the postcards, “so that people know there’s someone they can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphries, a friend of Ms. Davis’s for years, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at a low point on Christmas Day—when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they had overcome it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought, if we can really get what he asked for – a limited time and limited scope investigation – maybe we can bring some to unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “severed apart” in a deeply-rooted party deadlock.
Why wasn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters interested in an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance stems entirely from the timing.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not succeed in them, they will be very weak in their attempts to get the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI issues his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea ‘down’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seig, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for this were stricter border controls between North Korea and China, which are backed by money from people smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest and easiest border to cross, compared to the well-preserved military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this week, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which the two generally agreed to work toward an era when the Korean Peninsula would not possess nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the United States of the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee “hysterical” and said his character did not allow him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever showed up like this, they’d say ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh sensuously rejected claims that you sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him “coordinated, grotesque character assassination” organized by the liberals’ anger at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it prejudiced the Democrats.
“I think he’s recused himself with these statements and the way he pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it this way — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI then he’s not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against Obama's health reform or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There’s no reason for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect to be told, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It is a sharp criticism, months and years of rage overflowing, and she cannot express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, right?”
She went on, <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique and whenever she got angry and started crying, she used to say to the person she was talking to, <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are given as an outlet for anger, partly because they are not understood in essence.
One of my most significant memories of a job early in my life, in an office with a manly majority, is that I once found myself crying with unexpressed rage, and an older woman grabbed my back, that was a cool manager I was always a little afraid of—and dragged me into the stairwell.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve managed to suppress you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she wouldn’t consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about very well,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late in the campaign, she fell behind in raising funds, so she swore she would not join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced she would not start an official election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger over sexism — she was choked to tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening volleys of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the opening shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing responded each time in the same currency, and recently increased tariffs by five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to strike back at every blow the United States has struck, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will capitulate in the near future.
Asking Washington to retract would mean surrendering to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to do right, the pressures from the trade war with the U.S. could positively support China in the long term and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of an economic downturn in each country is actually much more dangerous than previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, in the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the war on terror,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All the conditions now exist for the refugees’ voluntary return to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the shattered country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. national team by a final score of 16.5-10.5 on the Le Golf National course outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mikaelson, who struggled almost the entire tournament, sent his batting T-point to the water in the 16th hole of the Far-3, losing the match against Francesco Molinari.
The brilliant Italian golfer Mulinari in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to reach 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current structure, in 1979.
The American player Jordan Spit was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter from England, possibly the last time he will play in the Ryder Cup.
With eight caps in the Ryder Cup, Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it now.
It's been a tough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to have the trophy back.
It’s a team, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on Sunday.
“The immense pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four games in France and his record is now 13-21-3, with the Ryder Cup career-high.
This is bizarre statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, with only Jack Nicklaus in front of him.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find their way on the lawns, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinault, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You have to take your hat off.
We've been defeated."
