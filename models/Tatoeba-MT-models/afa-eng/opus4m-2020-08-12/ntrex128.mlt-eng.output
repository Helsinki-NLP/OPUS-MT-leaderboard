AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as a booh"
There is cooperation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Walles Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are worrying that this will make them appear restrictive .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means ibnh and pwp means a rout.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group was not satisfied and suggested alternatives.
A conservative by Wales said that his group had "open mind" about the change in name, but noted that there was a small virtual difference from MWP to "Mupet".
In this context, the letter and in the Wales language are similarly owned for the letter's propellant and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter of the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government act empowered the Wales Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had broad support for the convening of a Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Wales Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus can be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the qualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the issue of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they have the public opinion in a referendum on change in the name of the country
Voting will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was established with a view to resolving a dispute that lasted for decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents .
President of Macedonia Giorge Ivanov, opposition to the fight on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zav, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Wings Stop As Church in Harlem Sends
"Stortly, the elders with whom I spoke say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialise differently" today.
"The bar is no longer the center of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
As regards the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or tomorrow they will end up where they were at first."
He added that churches could be replaced by blocks of apartments with condoms filled with people who would not help the rest of the locality walls.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building are a white garage," he said, "and so, they will not worry when it comes to the day they are spoken for these churches because most of these people who come to live in these condoms will not become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of white carnage people before Harlem became metropolitans of white carnation people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of White Caring People left in the 30s.
A Community of Black Carthage people who was practicing religion nearby took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of people in the Black Carriage under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a bookshop of retailers in 125 Street, a main way to buy in Harlem, who restrained the rental to or promotion of black-carriage people.
Fire in 1939 left the building with serious damage, but as the Father Johnson princes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the Carlon "the wings of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called him another thing: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to have a black raft musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who walked for the largest carilon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated history of experts and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the lay church, others by ethnical diocesis.
The 'vestry' - the parish government body, made up of laity leaders - wrote the Diocesis in July with concerns that the diocesis "will look for the costs" to the West, although the Westry was not involved in starting the clients and contractors sent by the diocesy.
Some parliamentarians complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocesis.
The shark hurts a 13-year-old child during a holiday for play in California
A sea dog attacked and attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fighting for the Job in California on the day of the opening of the austerity season, said the officials.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was dating friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then went to him with a group to help draw out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was the after-expression that caught a fast, but then "I realized that he was shouting, 'My lord!
Do you think I'll do it?'
He's opened all the clavicle," Hammel said that he realized the moment he arrived at the child's place.
"I fought to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
Take the child via a helicopter to Rady Children's Hostital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack were unknown.
The Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that the shark was salted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered tragic injuries in the upper part of the tortoise.
Officials closed access to Bay from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans enter the UK beauty market
Sansbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with wing corridors similar to those of 'department history' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial revenue on the UK’s beauty market of α2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods decline, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will be spread in more shops next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the blades that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sansbury's said that it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 objects, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tewezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product bands from L'Oreal, Mybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brand areas similar to those located in shops such as Boots.
The Supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Botique map so that the majority of products are healthy – something that is increasingly being asked of smaller buyers.
In addition, France Shop's perfume retailers will examine concessions in two Sansbury's shops, the first one opened in Croydon, in London below, last week, while the second one opened in Sylly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
On-line shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food per day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sansbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like 'department tours' as the supermarket chain tries to fight against stores that sell Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
Sansbury's has been putting Argos' shops in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought the two chains two years ago, which states that it strengthened the sale of the trade and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sansbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to share the income from the pharmacist's shops in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sánsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmay chain, for α125 million years ago.
Loyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of locous skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Sansbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be suitable for every need and the environment that attracts you and the convenient positions of the shops mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenges the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is ‘very upset’ after Holly Willowby cancels an agreement of 11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones is ‘very angry’ after the TV presentationer Holy Willowhby cancelled an agreement of 11 million with the business of his life-style firm to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spenser and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the brand of household products and their accessories, Truly.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concluded that the measures in question were compatible with the internal market and that the measures in question were not compatible with the internal market.
The presenter of Thiis Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she will leave.
Holly Willoughby left the personality of Dragons" Den Peter Jones was very angry because I cancelled from being part of their business of a life-style firm that would make a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at its huge business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with a value of up to α1.5 million - meant that it was not enough time to devote to their home and accessories firm, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop’s firm and was thought to double the estimated wealth of Willoughby of 11 million.
As soon as Willowhby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was going to leave with Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private pursuers.
Source said: "Truly was by far the first priority of Holly.
It would be its long-term future to be filled with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost there.
There is a full warehouse produced at the Marlow headquarters that are ready for sale."
The experts believe that the departure of the presentor of This Morning, which is among the profit-making properties of Great Britain, can mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in works and candles and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willowhby and her husband This Baldwin have been very close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowhby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as president of the Chairman in March.
The two couples travel together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willloughby will become a tourist of the M&S firm and will replace Ant McParlin as a representative of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Yesterday night, a nearby source of Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting but then we found love
He laughed at the criticism that he will turn out to be from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presiding" and that it was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice that imitates that of "a news presenter".
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump announced that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But they stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic understanding in his speech of demonstration.
He said, "We're going well with North Korea".
"We were going to engage in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – the end of rocket tests, the aid in the release of restaurants and the return of the remaining U.S. veterinarys.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this area filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, he pointing to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from their homes, no national disasters were declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Sorry, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it was challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Paul, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is still not well prepared for the high nature of anger.
While a shelter from the tsunami was built in Aceh, it was hardly seen on the coast.
The apparent failure of a seismic warning siren in Paul, despite having issued a warning, has likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best times, it is challenging to travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok for the care of the victims on its way to Paul, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Sunodo has improved the infrastructure that falls into Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent out funds as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from still sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where the members of the majority of the Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool brings the same points in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with a ‘goal’ on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturidge received the ball from Xerdan Shuqari while it was 27 metres away from Chelsea's Lab with his team that was losing 1-0.
You hit the ball slightly to his left before you shot the ball into the rod.
The ball above most of the box as it ended entered the top right of the net.
Eventually, the ball fell after Kepa Arizabalga, which passed to try to meet, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get in that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming on me and touched the ball once and I didn't think about it much and tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's stripper distributed the ball back to Mateo Kovac before leaving to the middle of the ground and then came quickly in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovac distributed the ball quickly in the middle of the ground.
Then shot the ball very nicely, which led Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran more than the players in the defence and sent the ball into the net with the left foot and passed through where Allison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool fights against Napoli at the stage of the Campions League groups on the 3rd afternoon of the next Wednesday at Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa League on 3 noon next Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunamis rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, said the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly caught under the debris of the building that fell due to the earthquake of 7.5 that occurred on Friday and caused up to 20 ft waves, said a speaker from the Sutopo Puro Nugroho agency at a news conference.
The city of Paul, with more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the building that fell.

The status of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the argument on the ‘rewritten of history’
His removal would be an appropriate form of justice for the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural acts committed by his 'Puritan' phantomatics.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "swift" and "tried to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmeth, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of states that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of the British civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thornycroft of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith said to Sonday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defencer of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monargia.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-century conflict of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure recognised as representing one side of that division.
His achievements as 'Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.'
A Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
Farmers were attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-east China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-out arter, covered with blood near a sham on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in Hogry on 30 May 2005 in Xing of the Province of Kingshai, China.
On the basis of the information provided by the Commission, the Commission concluded that the measures in question were compatible with the internal market and that the measures in question were not compatible with the internal market.
The next morning, his cousins found dead, and discovered a door to the pig's ass in the open vicinity.
He said there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Critical legs were blood and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his name "Wu", as quoted by the Guiang Evening News.
The safety camera films showed Juan entering the market on Thursday morning 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan was not Yuan's or cousin's.
Market manager told Evening News that the pig was arrested not to attack others, while the police gathered evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously registered.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he killed his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Puregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told the CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive but the blood taste can act as a "cause."
"They'll be playing.
They swim, they are very curious... they do not intend to hurt you.
Only you want to show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Uragan Rosa will bring a heavy rain spread in the south-east of the United States
As foretold, the Uragan Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods around northern Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mf, Category 1 hurricane, on 5 a.m. in the morning at Sunday's time, and was located 385 miles in the south-west direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a 'trogh' on the Pacific Ocean and it is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing strong tropical moisture in the north-west direction of the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching ‘trogh’ creates a strong south-easterly rain in the coming days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residual streams and possible volcanoes in the desert.
A strong tropical humming will cause rain rates to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the south-east, especially on most of the Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Pregnant rain can cause ‘canyons’ to become dangerous rivers and storms will cause a very local and dusty wind.
The 'trogh' will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total of more than half an inch rain is possible, which may cause small leakages and drift roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their rainy season.
Some rainy tropical storms spread to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain is spread further late Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain spreads into the Future Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
There may be some strong temperature changes across the US in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic differences in temperature from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in the temperature of 20 degrees between Cansus City, Missouri, and Oama, Nebraska, and St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A major share of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plans to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting witness on Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused of committing a sexual attack allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasy Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political fight continued, with the broadcasters who interrupted regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flicke for the FBI to carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee that it was certain 100 per cent that Kavanaugh was absha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove the clothes when they were at the post-secondary school level.
Kavanaugh, in a silent witness, said that it is 100 per cent sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
the company accounted for the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Business Network Fax.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinioners strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was immediately behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a declaration that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, those who protested from CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were screaming at him as he tried to go up on the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a direct broadcast on CNN.
"Stand here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
"You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the doors of the lift, that it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the designation of Kavanaugh for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person the following week, that democratic minorities had been encouraging.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cons and several years later, Flake took his decision.
The decision of Flake had the power, as it was clear that the Republics would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of the policy" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union that are "taking advantage" of the policy and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was "fully devoided."
Shooting on Wede Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspects after the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Waye Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officials issued a film of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the on-site glasses and said they found Simpson DNA on them, reporting the CBS, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to shooting and killing Wede.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reporting Advocate.
He issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death was damaged by a head-to- neck gun.
The department is granting credit to the Louisiana State Police Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Atlantic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement of the area for "due diligence and the search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters long, reared in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ each game in the past season.
The morning Friday, the band of the LSU Will Wood basketball said that the team was located "loss" and "under shock" after the death of Wede.
"This is what worries about him all the time," said Wood.
Vulcan throws the ash on Mexico City
Ash that is being disposed of by the Popotatepetl volcano has reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the critter increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various sounds and technical movements.
Social media pictures showed a thin layer of ash covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xocimilco.
As of December 2017, he was a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The known volcano has been active since 1994 as Don Goyo.
Police have a conflict with dissidents from Catalonia prior to the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favour of independence had had a conflict with anti-communicado police, and as thousands joined the protest demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarisation vote on the recession.
A group in favour of the front-backed separated from the anti-rupters police gave them eggs and dust paints, and created a cloud of dark dust on the roads that are generally filled with tourists.
There were also minor fights during the day and the police had to use the guns to control the fights.
Over a period of several hours, groups in support of independence were fighting "We don't forget, we don't argue" against unionist demonstrators who were shouting, "Spain Always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor problems received in the protests, reported local press.
Tensions remained high in the region which wants independence one year after the 1 October referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by independents from Catalonia.
Votingers chose a major barrier to becoming independent, although the participation was low with those who were against the recession that made a big bokout against the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were transferred last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups were campaigning during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was done but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separate protest with his wife said that there was no hope in the prospects that Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we were alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the catalonia's independence supporters are sending to maintain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in the exile they have decided themselves or in detention and are waiting for the process because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old machine who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by both sides' policies.
"There's been more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who is in prison before the end of last year's trial, announced that he would challenge the European Parliament's elections next year.
"As we come out as a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to condemn the repression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a strong house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after having entered a car more than once by force into a house in Londondry.
The incident took place in Ballenagard Crescent on Thursday for the crash of 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the grades and buildings themselves.
It may also have been used as a crossbow to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga Goal wins a game 1-0 for Livingstone against Rangers
First 'Goal' of Dolly Menga's for Livingstone won the game
Livingstone, which was promoted, gave Rangers a blow and thus Steven Gerhard lost only for a second time in 18 games as a 'club' coach of Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga's ball shooting made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in the points with Heberian in the second place.
Gerard's side has not won once outside its globe at the Premiership in this season and next Sunday will play against Hearts, who first placed eight points behind them.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their round in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingstone continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with the main Holt coach that hasn't missed a game since it came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities against golf visitors
The Holt Messus team that was winning before he had a ‘goal’, with the direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but split the ball in front of the Lassa, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide-boded ball after he slammed to get the ball from the head out of Craig Hallett near the Lassa.
Those who were playing in their own globe were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that they were the visitors who could give them problems at certain times.
And that was the way the crucial ‘goal’ came.
Rangers allowed 'free-kick' to enter and Livingstone took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the rod from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominant over the possession of the ball, but were finding the defence of the team that were playing in their own grand, non-penetary, and the “goalkeper” Liam Kelly did not have much trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a ‘goal’ because of the ‘goalkeper’ of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball wide after dividing another player of Livingstone.
Ballen was always in the box of Livingstone and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty’ - following the attempt of Halket on the replacement Glenn Midleton, and another after the ball was touched by the hands of a player - were refused.
phenomena from Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Area Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenon outcome for Livingstone.
For a man, they were excellent, continued to exceed expectations on this trajectory upwards.
The style of games and their staff have not changed much from returning to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way the team has been united since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
The chief Halket was very large in his games, by organising a very well-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain times under Gerard, there was a lack of good standards once again.
Their last opportunity with the ball was not good - only once they managed to separate the defence of the team that was playing in his own globe - and it is a sign for Rangers, to find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people coming and hearing blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – with a view to reforming the relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mask.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters of it came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turks and who is thought to be an ‘autocrit’ from others.
Road crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a car accident
Cyclist died in an accident involving a car in London.
The storm took place close to the split of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic road in Deptford, south-east of the city, to the strike at 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and attended the paramedia, but the man died on the spot.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and remained in Childs Street, about a mile away from last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six official to be ordered
Six prison officials were put back after a disturbance in a high-security man's prison, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started in HMP Long Lartin at Wancestershire for the 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still under way.
Specialised officials "Tornado" were introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor on-site injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who have committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-iron officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which the personnel were attacked by the ‘pool’ balloons.
Uragan Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a rapid flood (Current Areas Can Benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen next week as the remaining Uragan Rosa energy moves from south-west of the Territory, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temp Service has already established a quick flood watch for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass on a straight line from Phoenix on Tuesday, and to approach Monday with the rain.
The National Telegraph Phoenix Service noted in a second that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical weather or depression status within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrin (1967) was hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the Uragan National Centre predict from 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogolon Rim.
Other areas of the South-Western including the central Rockies and the Basin Great are likely to have between 2 inch and 2 inch, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inch.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rain can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, second highest category," reported by water.com.
First, the route of the Uragan Rosa was led to touch the island of Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be very strong on Sunday morning with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
As a result, it is expected to touch Mexico with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early in the evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A rain total of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches", reported by water.com.
Then Rosa will move north around Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as tropical depression, and then going from Arizona and south Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is a very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and in the south-east desert of the United States," said the U.S. National Centre of Uruguay.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and land-breaking streams in the deserts, and mountainland valves.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested following attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old teenager with knife wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the area of Midsomer Norton, for the strike of 04:00 BST on Saturday.

Trump said that Kavanaugh “sent the green and anger” of the Democratic Party
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sent the green and anger’ of the Democratic Party during his designation process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, with power and emotion he denied an allegation by Christine Blasy Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were a teenager.
Ford also testified during the hearing on its claim.
Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the Bravura and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vot to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most legal minds of our time, a journalist with an impenetrable public service record", he told the group of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't argue, but in truth, I am challenging," he said.
"That's why I run everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote within the Senate on the designation of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a senior assistant of the PDO leadership to CNN.
Hundreds were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of deaths apparently increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many suffered as massive waves came down on beaches, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday when waves of up to six feet (18 ft) fell by force on the ground when darkness began to fall, while many suffered and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami took place after an earthquake of strength of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise up to run immediately and the victims ended," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during briefing in Jashar.
"The tsunami did not appear alone, pulled cars, logs, houses, hit everything there on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea with 800 kf speeds (497 mf) before hit the shore.
Some people went up the trees to escape the tsunamis and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were seen for 24 centres in Paul.
Air photos from the disaster agency showed many buildings and destroyed shops, bridges surrounding themselves and falling and a mossque surrounded by water.
Strong shocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy released by the huge earthquake of the Week was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the city's geography, located at the end of a long, narrow beach, could have grown the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of a fallen building, he said, adding that 540 people were once and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely sent and without information" from Dongala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not knowing that tsunami hit Paul, although officials said that the storm had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a film of the social media-sharing athletes, a man on the top wall of a building can be heard shouting anxious warnings for tsunamis that were approaching people on the way below.
In a few minutes, a huge amount of water fell by force on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not authenticate the films immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a severe cut in light which reduced communications around Paul and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakar and other cities, but the vacuums still need food and other basic needs.
The airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
It was scheduled that President Joko Sunodo would visit evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of World Visa's from Dongala arrived in the city of Paula, where the employees were planning to be armed Tarpole servers in the outpost of their office, they went through a scene of evacuation on their way there, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "Say I have seen many houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster aid process, some complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel abroad can only start to enter if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's a disaster of province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but there is no status so far."
At the second night in Paul after the earthquake and tsunamis of the Week, the friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles of this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, people who performed a free rescue woman who was caught under the crush for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other people caught in the Lucanda Roa Roa, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a super person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon related how, in the hours after the news of the fall of the Lucanda Roa Roa circulated among the Parising community, he sent messages with WahtsApp to the competitors of Paul, who were taking part in the holiday on the beach.
His messages, however, marked only that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that what means that the messages have not arrived," he said.
Hillin takes $26,750 while ATM was refilling in Newport on the Leave

The car driver was losing ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarty wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with his work, another man "is happening from behind Brink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the accident.
Anyone who has information about their identity shall contact the Newport Police on 859.292-3680.
Canye West: The therapeutic channel changes its name to Y
The Canye West therapeutic channel is changing its name - for Ye.
While announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Ye for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch his new Yankee album.
He replaces the Grand Ariana Grande on the program that I cancelled for "emergency reasons", said the programme’s creator.
In addition to being an abreast of his current professional name, West agreed that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most word used in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you,' said West earlier this year, while he was discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy radio broadcaster.
"So I am, you, I am, she is, we are.
From Canye which means 'the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what shakes us, everything.
The album is a more reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous therapeutic singers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Mandy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced to prefer the names Love and Brothers Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, it is also served with or without a single and capital letter.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Oberdor promised on Saturday in the Tlatelolco Pazza that " never will use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the flat on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening up more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area, says the investor and practical IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the USA.
In the meantime, China has introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in the innovation of the IA by 2030.
"Making the budget for IA research would be a good start, since all other countries are much more back than the US, and we are looking for the next Revolutionary step in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funds can double the possibilities that the next major IA achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcort, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest American Othhello classification, and was then executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee has recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Chalenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it will be the next, to help identify the next vision.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get grants from the government.
Lee said, "It is not China that removes academic leaders; corporations are doing this,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a doctorate in the IA".
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Artistic Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the China National Foundation of Natural Science provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Another quarter this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Technical Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artic Intelligence.
And the DARPA month announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the US legislation which has tried to create a National Security Commission on Artistical Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that resolves a conflict that has been ongoing for decades with Greece which had blocked its partnership offers to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the incident in its north represents a possibility of ownership of its territory and made a vis-à-vis its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments came to an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slavi majority of Macedonia.
President Giorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum's vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU in acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zav, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgejevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there was no report of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Giusee Tanevski, 62, voter in capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zav, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was throwing a small palk and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who will make a referendum boycott.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly under our conditions, not by ordering others," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that membership in NATO will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zav after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below what is required.
Another survey, carried out by a Macedonian TV Telema, found that 57 per cent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum does not succeed, it represents the first serious government policy in favour of Western theologians from the moment he took control of it in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, the Manchester City player, passes all of Brighton's defence to the Goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defence in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethiad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his ‘goal’ in the 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the round at the beginning of the sequence.
From between three Brighton defenders before a race into an open space.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players with green flashing.
Fight one defender before fleeing much more from the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he distributed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English attacker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball in the right side of the net by passing it through where Brighton Matthew Ryan had gone.
"Aguero is sending some trouble in his legs," said the coach of City Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck of making a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight against Premier League.
That ‘goal’ occurred in the 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball very much in the territory of Brighton in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane on the left very nicely.
Sane touched the ball some time before leading Sterling where the Lassa.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball slightly and brought it into the net just before landing into an unlikely territory.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Campions League groups at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in a Spoiler vs. Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But the player so competitive Scherzer spares that he can be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue to compete with a win 5-2 against the Nationals Friday evening, but are still looking for the first title of the division.
"Since we are playing for nothing, we may at least have the possibility of winning by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What does it not want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the 'pitcher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting at 34 times, has had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a lifter on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington plays with the right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strakeout’ in 220 2/3 ‘indings’ in this season.
Trump demonstrations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Bert Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, he will be threatened with everything we have done.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very great--I don't dispute, but in truth, I'm challenging so I'm fighting everywhere for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very awesome and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happen now," continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back the power by using any means possible, you can see the green.
It doesn't matter to those who hurt them, to those who want to fly to get power and control, to those who want, power and control, we won't give them."
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And I've been able to see this over the last four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats "sraged and green and disgruntled and dissident."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Committee of the Judiciary of Saint Diane Feinstein by name, and received many negative riots from the audience.
"Do you remember her response?
Have you issued the Document?
Oh, oh, what it is.
No, and no, I wait, firstly the movements of her body were not positive - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Do not tolerate those who communicate their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to give me a chance, they did not take it very seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party which was not welcomed positively - because we have communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought anti-attackism.
In my case, the motion of a cliché was critical because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the evening General Council meetings were exactly so.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the policy promise "more merciful and kind" has been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever started in truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar policy began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions that I never agreed with in other situations – both on national security and on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, do not make any difference what I say - they run after me with abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my office of MP, renounce the policy of the centre, and tell me that I do not have a part in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more good luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual or racial abuse every day but are never hidden from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that the levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of "untrust" or a change in selection rules, the party becomes narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that have urged me to keep my opinions for me, so that I don't be that loud and then everything's "be good."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been reminded by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disaster state, I have sought to improve public services for those most in need – both as a local adviser and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my policy positions and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the movement on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to bring time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that will remove me from my office or from political expansion will deter me from acting in those who believe that they are your best interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Aar, which has not yet been lost once, climb up the top in the rating
Two attempts could have slightly changed the result, but there was no doubt that Air was entitled to win this exciting day's game of Tennt's Premiership.
They are currently the first to be classified, the only team out of all ten that have not been lost once.
Finally, it was the superior defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own grand, winning, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had trials during our games so far, and we haven't lost one, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christi of Melrose said: "Give Ayr credit, they've taken advantage of better opportunities than we."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Air was winning, but, yellow paper from the head of Scotland Roy Hughez, which was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Bagot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended the victory of Air with a ‘penalty’, before, in the middle of the game exactly, made ‘goal’ and converted an individual attempt to make the points 17-5 for Ayr in the lunch.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson's, converted by Batgot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruardh Knott, which came out of the ground on a stripper, and as soon as it started again the game, Air continued to take the points after an attempt by Stepford McDoual, converted by Climo.
Then, the chief agent of Air Blair MacPherson was given yellow paper, and once again, Melrose came out with aggression when they tried unconverted by Bruce Colvine, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own grid began to attack again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow paper for the action he did on Climo without the ball, from the line of the penalty, MacPherson touched the ball with the ground at the back of the advancing Air group.
Climo converted, as he did once again from the area from which he started the game again, after Kyle Roy gathered the ball to David Armstrong meetings through the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who played with the side, for the five attempts of the part she was playing in her own globe.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
The seafarers stay watch of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the engine: "The sea is ours right.
To recover it is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains clear - as soon as Bolivians are able to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and sensibility, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive thought," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ decision on large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Tribune in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous headman - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to getting access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that a little change would have taken place.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the result of possible talks.
That the ICJ judgment only comes six months after hearing the final arguments, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And away from the outcome of the Bolivian case, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current administration of Bolivia," said Zárate.
The hostile repertoire of Morales has weakened any remaining Chilean goodwill, it has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
Both countries have not shared ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutual disagreement", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never surrender its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the revals.
The United States Secretary of State, Mike aimed at re-launching the nuclear diplomacy that is more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is "a hope empty" that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread seismism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce an armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of clothing for the huge head that will appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to the collection of your hat or cover the sun completely, you can stop looking.
Valentino designers and Tom Browne revealed a range of strange and very large headwear for their spring and summer collection of 2019 on the runway that won the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats are very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers have raised their surprising creations on the palk.
The item most outstanding by Valentino was an extravagant beige hated with a wide edge similar to the feathers that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other accessories of very large size included joint-coated jellies, espionage hats and even pineapples – but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a strange mask choice - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had the furrowed lips and were more like Hannibal Leecter than the ‘Haute code’.
One correction was similar to the complete surveyion device with snorkel and goggles, while another was like a cone of melted ice cream .
And if you continue with this good style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge ‘bonnets’ will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hat comes out after the exit of 'La Bomba', the bee hat with a broad edge of two feet worn by all from Rihana to Emily Ratajkoski.
The ‘colult label’ responsible for the hat which is nothing practical that has appeared much on the social media have raised another great creation on the palk - a straw bag that contains almost as much as the clothing pattern they were carrying.
The dark orange balcony bag, surrounded by the small squeezing of the ruff and with a white skin cap, was the most remarkable creation in the spring and summer collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent Lukee Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large marine hats and bags in the main shops for the coming summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Skills in languages essential for global citizens
Independent Scotland schools maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examination results, which is only strengthened with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see modern languages remain subject to popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language that he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks his own language, he understands it with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we need to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of rating tables with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages now, as a subject option, are maintained in the same respect as STEM subjects (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers to the fact that they are sending job vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective work opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career to choose, if you learn another language, it will have a real advantage in the future because it has the ability to survive such a life.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken in two digits.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for children today.
Knowing more than one language, in particular those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on modern more classical languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a number of languages that will be able to choose from them in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, whatever the future may be.
At present, it cannot be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
The mother-in-law is not a fair.

On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Luckers in San Diego
The sports parties of LeBron James no longer expected to start for the first time for Los Angeles Luckers.
Luke Walton's coach announced that James will play in the opening game before starting the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuguettes in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Luckers.
The journalist of the Lucker Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six games before the start of the Luckers season.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
A demonstration of Trump in West Virginia, Ytube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of tonight's demonstrations in Welling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable places including Tennesse and Monsippi.
With the suspended confirmation vote for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as the Republics are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in Nov.
At a time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how did she show it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Welling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tone, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the candidature of the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh, which has been intensified due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republics face the November elections to achieve a little momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at " giving energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republics try to protect and expand their majoritys in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Conference Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we can as we approach the commitment campaign season," he told Reuters spoke to the Trump campaign to be named.
A schedule for the Wesbanco Area in Welling, the night demonstration can gather parties from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburg media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state which won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Saint Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is missing in the survey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has come to try to boost him in the survey," said Simon Heeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States Team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday's singles
After three sessions on one side, the Saturday afternoons could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum hanging pendulum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more in such competitions.
So where do they say it's the momentum now?
"These were at the front with six points and now are with four, so I think we're carrying it as a little moment," said Jordan Speth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four front points with a further twelve to be played.
The Americans, says Speth, feel that they have little obstacles and have much to encourage them, not at least the form of Speth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one boasts three out of four.
Speth was accurate from time to time and is running by example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, by making a crucial point to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two from below after two.
His shot that won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera must go deep and worry about your own item," said Speth.
This is what gives them every one of these players now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Speth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, the incontroversial history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four with four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair who did not heal Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday mornings, Friday afternoon and the 9th morning.
That race, and the way their energy looks both to and from this live crowd sets out that they are the players offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun goes down on Le golf National from Fleetwood or Molinary.
Both are preferably at random on different holes.
But here we are talking about the early European glory for it.
Watson and Web Simpson quickly completed by Sergeio Garcia, the hero of morning football, when it was put in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never managed to get close to coming out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Powerballs and Powersomes are very impressed to see them closely due to peer interactions, advice, advice that they do not give and how a strategy can change in a second.
Europe has played better as a team, so it has come to the top on the final day, but this session of the Foursomes has also shown that the US Team has determined that some, especially on the US side, were questioning.
Europe at the top 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it has been released from Saturday's 10-6 football and Saturdays items on the US.
The inspired pair Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so forward in Le golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the tropheum lost in Haseltine two years ago, dominated the American side that went badly in the morning Fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the Foursomes, by winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in the score.
Jim Furyk's side required eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday player to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season that won four points after each other while it and Molinari, vaccinated "Molliwood" after a sensibilist webend are only the second pair that won four points from their four opening points in the Ryder Cup history.
Having dominated Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs then worked excellently to win Woods that did not seem optimistic and to the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with a even more hepatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in the two parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brillity but now lost 19 of its 29th in the Fourballs and the Foursomes and seven after each other.
Justin Rose, a party to morning football, returned to Henryk Stevenson's partner in the Foursomes for a loss of 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are ranked first and third in the world.
But not everything happened as Europe had wanted on a beautiful day, with a little light in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Speth, a great three-fold winner, and Justin Thomas set the two-point limit for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a courageous victory of 2&1 on Jon Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the Fourballs and later returned to win Poulter and Roy McLroy with 4&3 in the Four-Foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that came back from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although Furyk's holders need a custom to keep the trophy.
However, after having been the second best for two days, a Sunday's counter seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea states that "no way" will be unilaterally dismantled without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would have left its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "extreme good will measures" last year, such as setting up nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stages" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as it took steps gradually, his declaration appeared significantly that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation without thinking of how it had done in the past Pyongyang.
Re referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a president of the United States serving his duties and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a coherent way, and even objects to the "end-of-war declaration", said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a blocking."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the goal of targeting the United States continental land with North Korea rockets was inevitable after the "President Kati" Trump called Kim "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened North Korea to "completely destroy", commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearised.
Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stop until we realize fully and completely verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pombeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and said that he would again visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that progress had been made, after that North Korea criticized in a few hours for making "claims like a gangster".
In a meeting with Mona this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "correspondent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in making all of her students who have not yet graduated sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture to study all night and to stay awake thanks to caffeine.
Academy found that students at university in the first place in the world often have no idea about the basic true things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"At last a girl was on me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - who surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started this year for the first time, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a school room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, triners and books to understand the effects of coffee and light and how athletic performance will have an effect from sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
It then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as much as you have the right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture that "successed to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps enough, and of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a way of hunger, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course around the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to do a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for getting up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to problems in sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal misses the men of Gerard
Rangers suffered another period of distress when they were played abroad as Dolly Menga's strip delivered Steven Gerhard's separate side to a loss of 1-0 in Livingstone.
Ibrox's side was seeking to record their first victory while travelling from the February 4-1 trihonofali victory in St Johnston, but Gary Holding's team only caused the second loss of Gerard in 18 items as a manager to leave his side eight points away from the great leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of players of Rangers missing inspiration never appeared to have reached it.
While Rangers now descend to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third and only after Hibernian on a difference of team.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the Linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head after apparently throwing an item on the party side of the team that played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes on the side that passed through Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Levi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased with the way his well-trained form constantly hindered their opponents.
Rangers could have dominated the possession but Livingstone did more with the ball they had.
They had to scan only two minutes from the start when the first-time straight-off of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's champion but the migilder took his great chance.
Free-kick a strong Keahan Jacobs then found the Kriig Hallett skiper but his partner Alan Lithgow could only act from behind.
Rangers have achieved control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the big final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the mark of fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawless fought but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Cuban appeals.
Rangers managed to target well only two pieces in the first half of the item but the former Goalkeper of Ibrox Liam Kelly hardly worried him about the headache of Lassana Coulibally and the light strike of Ovie Ejaria.
While Levi's first champion in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that he had earned them only for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage a good set-face of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher pulled the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerard responded in the brake by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winder acts in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to draw visitors to play exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halket who caught a long ball after a long ball.
The Holt side could extend their front position in the final stages but McGregor held fast to reject Jacobs before Lithgow went into the open corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glen Middleton had another late request for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but once again Thomson looked at the other side.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Continer
And now page by our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, as today 136 years old, and TODNA WE ARE NEVER ... the day on which the future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Contactor.
A foundation of science since then, Geiger's contractor has also become a foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those unlikely co-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
Man: "What the mammoth is?"
Rogers: "That Geiger Contactor, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these caps, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, of course it's popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he finished 63 years.
But the invention by name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which is converted into a laboratory
They can then "see" a common protein for many cancers and then be injected again.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, these are converted into the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein for many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West did a Verbali Task Favur Trump, while wearing a Birita of MAGA, After his appearance on SNL.
This Is Not Good
Kanye West was booked in the study during Saturday Night Live after a confused performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to be elected in 2020.
Following his third night song, called You Town in which he was wearing a wedding dress of Mace America Great, he began to say against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I spoke to a white person and said to me, "How can Trump please, that racist?"
If I had been concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL started the programme with a discharge of the press in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star redispatched Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasy Ford.
Although he did not broadcast, West's video was posted on the social media by the communist Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to turn you in with West when he postponed it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught with him after the incident about his brand.
"Buy me after the quantum.
They said, "Don't go out there with that draft."
I was beaten!
Then they say they're lost," said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? And he continued saying that he would "I wear my superman's hat, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try with love."
His comments triggered at least twice the audience and the members of the SNL case appeared embossed, reported Variety, with one person there who said to the publication: "In all the study a great silence fell."
West brought him as a late substitute for the Grand Ariana Grande, which the boyfrand she had, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West buried many with the performance of the song I Love it, wearing as a bottle of Perier.
West was supported by the president of the TTPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GROUND TO THE FOLD."
But the presentor Karen Hutter wrote on Twitter that West simply was "what he is and this is something very beautiful."
"But I did not choose to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is involved and disseminates a geology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So far we're," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now it was "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Handy, Poffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lyon and of course the music legend that was no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder on knife shots in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of murder after having been given knife shots in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Justice of Belfast Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thornes Kit Harington style speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as John Snow in the violent midevent series of HBO Game of Thornes.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke about the heliotype macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the young man often feels that they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic musculinity in the #Meto era.
Kit, who recently married his 31st year of game of Trones Rose Leslie, admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, currently - where we went bad with masculinity?" said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its many male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes young people feel that they want to be on this particular side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how to change this?
Because it's very clear that something went wrong for the young man."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do any prequalities or games of Therones when the series came to its end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
As of November Kit will appear in the new production of Sam Shepard's Troe West which is the history of a film producer and his brother, who is a successor.
The actor recently revealed that he considered that when he met Rose's wife, it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thornes.
"I met my wife on this program, so this way gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snoe, in the series of fantasy she won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, one year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Gender transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Sexuality has been criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Most disease transmissions come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has disclosed data of GOP sensors, says "dangerous lies" and "confessive theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters stated that on the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators, a member of her staff had replaced the personal information of three U.S. Republican authors.
The Democrat of Los Angeles ensured that the claims were disseminated by punctuations and websites of the "uptra right side".
"A lie, a lie and more lies of a liar," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly released included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Sensors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill at a meeting of the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three-year-olds interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a Water staff member, reported the Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and absolute lies," continued Waters.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including by the former Secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer press.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that it does not have the will to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
It shall not question the motives of the accused.
It shall be silent and will."
Felischer appeared to have compared the response of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is going to take the seat of Waters in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be discovered," continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all of my staff members."
Johnney English Strikes Again-Rowan Atkinson, imitation of poor hospitality
It has now become traditional to seek the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this appears to be applicable to the return of Johnny-English Community action franchise – which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and took her life back in 2011 with Johnny English Reuben.
Is the ironic autoastria on the subject of how bad we are, of course, would be the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, the competing Johnny English with large eyes and parts of his face moving not as usual had the licence renewed for the second time to do anything wrong - that name more than anything else shows that it is a widespread common creation designed for non-English-speaking people's territories.
He is of course the secret agent who despite his strange claims up to his sweet fascist, has some of Clouseau, a meeting of Mr Bean and most of that man who contributed one note to the melodies of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on the traveller and the international husband of a mystery that Atkinson once had made his part in Barclaycard TV ads, today forgotten, after leaving a nightmare behind him.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching an helicopter while it was wearing medival helmets and the blades of the circus caught with his helmet for a while.
The entrance of Atkinson to the physical confectionery appears, but the amortism feels quite poor and extra in a strange way, especially since the "serial" film marks such as 007 and the Impotible Mission themselves offer the comedy as an ingredient in a confident way.
Moorism is felt as if it were aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the tragic tragic incidents of Johnny English were not as innovative and as focused as the silent film joke of Atkinson in Bean's personal.
The vertical perennial proposal now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber-infiltre of the web web was very secreted by British hospitals, by exposing the identitys of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the working agent – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister which is an enormous figure and with difficulties, which is already suffering from a complete collapse of political lack of popularity: Emma Thompson does its best with this character as Teresa May but there is not much in the text to work.
Its intelligence advisers inform it that every active cost has been compromised, it will have to bring someone retired.
And this means the incompetence Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an egalitarian building, but gives non-official lessons on how to become an filter: a little good laugh here as English offers a school of the School of Rocking.
English is taken back in Whitehal to emergency meetings and joins his former partner of great patience, Bogh, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now married, with a submarine commander, the role of one river interpreted by Vicki Peperdine, in which it is a little loose.
So both indistinguishable that always disturb everything in its Master's Secret Service, are back in action, when they meet the character of a beautiful, seditious woman, Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Krylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet technology billionaire who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer: the nurse Jason Volta, interpreted by Jack Lacy.
English and Bogh start their journey of fun behavior on a farm: dressed as weaters, fire a high French restaurant, create cases to get up on Volta's luxury yacht; and English starts a whole anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality cupboards to familiarise himself with the home of Volta.
Of course all the stops lead to that last sequence, but as amifiable as they are, he has a little idea of a child's television.
Something pretty modest.
And like the other Johnnie English films I couldn't think of: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves for his talent?
The Labour refuses to prepare a plan for the British to work for a week of four days but is paid for five days
The Armour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British working for a week of four days – but paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company teacher to pass the remnants of the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them another day.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend – but still taking the same pay with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "fit" with the agenda and economic plans of the party that the country turns in favour of workers.
The shift to a week of four days has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way of taking advantage of the changing economy by workers.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We are waiting to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"This is not going to happen tomorrow but a four-day work week is an inspiration that is worthy of the party's approach to balancing the work-friendly economy as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party which promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not currently being approved by the Labor Party as a whole.
Speaker to the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Opposition Cancellator John McDonnell used the Labore conference last week to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to return power from "anonymous directors" and "profiters" in utility firms.
The opposition channel plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return their entire share as a Labour government can make a "reducing" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Fishing Funds to grant 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, which are ready to take annual dividends up to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says to "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on its nomination to the Supreme Court by week, and raised the question as to whether the findings of the bareau could influence a Republican rapporteur to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the Correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pley asked the Republican Saints John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their understanding.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Come on, and be sure," said Kennedy.
"I said and entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
Call it after it happened, after it issued that claim, I said, "Have you done it?"
He was resolved, determined, encovic."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and must be a very great accuse," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bert's hard," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person mentioned cannot verify this.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new."
What is the Global Cityzen Festival and do something to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global City Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and a similar impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Cityen Festival will see tens of thousands of people streaming to the Great Law of Central Park not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project, a group of representation with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concerters had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as voluntary, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a call or other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Cityzen with the remaining 12 years to achieve its objective?
Is the idea of people being rewarded with free concert a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it only another case of so-called "cliquering" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a reply?
Since 2011, Global Cityzen says that it has registered more than 19 million "action" than its sponsors, which I insist on a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK of investors and implementers committed to "helping children to grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end nutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 tickets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of the deution note in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Trade Ullman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and a child with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long, hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and against the apartheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present it by Deborah-Le Ference and Hugh Jackman.
The United States uses the Naval Fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Naval fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, disclosed the United States Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Exminer.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it operates with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Naval fleet, to ensure that the seacourses are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that would act as the "energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, slightly or excessively, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-skilled" with an economy dependent on spent fuels.
The claims come from the fact that Trump's administration was on mission to strengthen its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit from the “unappropriate” gasload project, which according to Trump, made Berlin the “simp” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gasket of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gasd capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main organisation for industry, the German Industry Federation (BDI), invited the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Cancellier Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser "Sweet Review" If you do not leave for President in 2020, Say Your Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, Saturday, said that he would "make a good examination" if he would come out for president after the mid-term elections.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it considers it to be an issue.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, we will carefully examine whether we will take a Chair."
Warren commented about President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in his criticism of Trump and his nominee to the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think they should be elected in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said that the sensors should not be elected, according to the survey of the University Political Research Centre of Sufolk/Boston Global.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the election issue by the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting an exit for the potential election and 48 per cent against it.
Other high profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential issue for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Pallin refers to the TPD of Tack Palin at the Donald Trump demonstration
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after it was registered in September
He was arrested and brought to an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he has returned, I can relate to other families that feel the horrors of the PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return," she told the audience in a demonstration to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is dealing with" and said about her son and other war doctors, "they return a little different, return stronger, wonder whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like themselves and airmen, and every other member of the military, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wesilla, Alaska, and brought on a domestic violence attack on a woman, while he intervened with a report of domestic violence and armed possession while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson to the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and district, Friday brought a court friend case to Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace against Sessions submitted by the American Union of Civil Freedoms in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but the US officials refused her asylum request on 20 July.
It was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as the nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeal which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of Columbia Karl Racine District, said that the new policy "necessary decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive infringes this principle, stating the case of a friend of the court.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy denying immigrants entry would harm the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to cease to give asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"assignment is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Paul as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while accompanying her son with a fevery baby in an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Paula.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents seemed to return to their homes destroyed, looking for their water-stricken things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 size, were too filled.
Some of the hurt, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a breach in the back and in the face, remained outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continuous healthy shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he related that he felt the violent earthquake moving the floor of the hotel in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper released an advert on four pages in a newspaper of the United States which is issued daily to try to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the United States ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the paid-up of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper being sold most in the state of Iowa - after accusing China seeking to enter into the US Congress elections on 6 November, accused China of rejecting it.
The charge of Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what the US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign that was emerging from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an emerging trade war which they saw passing tariff rounds on each of them's imports.
The Chinese retaliatory charges at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brand, the United States ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Brandt on an opinion page in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now you double this bulldozer by making propaganda adverts in our own free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious tradition of the Americas of free expression and free press by placing advertising paid in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brand.
"In contrast, on the press stand down here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is under a restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper.
The Republics are moving to women's Votes before the Mid-Term Election with Kavanaugh's Debate, Absence the Analysts
As many of the top Republicans are supporting and defending the candidature of the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, the analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions about this were very high, and most of the Republics are already officially showing that they wanted to vote.
These things can't be reversed," said Grant Recher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Searchcase University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Recher said he doubted that the last minute's push of Senator Jeff Flicke (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to call angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not be forgotten tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Movon progressive group Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
In the morning, the demonstrators sang "Nov.!" as they presented in the Senate hall as the Republics controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run the designation of Kavanaugh despite the declaration of Dr. Christine Blasy Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between women voters who change votes in sub-bodies and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public declaration that gave details of its allegations of sexual assault against the candidature of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it could follow an adverse reaction if the Republicans acted with confirmation.
"This has become a full talk for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to the NBC News.
"This does not only concern the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republics handled this situation and how it dealt with it," indicate to the news station Guy Cecil, director of PRIORITIES USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans appear to be somehow divided over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's declarations, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YGov shows that 41 per cent of the respondents believed definitively or probably the Ford declaration, while 35 per cent said they believed definitively or probably the Ford declaration.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied during his declaration, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations submitted by Ford as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramírez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked it while he was a drinker at 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court’s nominee had exposed his genetics to her while they were at a festival when studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building on the solid open source platform of Berners-Lee.
A solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intention after Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We need to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses solid technology to allow people to create their "own online data store" or POOD.
This may contain contact lists, lists of things to be done, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slake and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the unique online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomisation through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is to bring resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
By starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are changed below today.
"We are not asking for their permission."
On a medium site published on Saturday, Bernards-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it established a World Wide Web consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Bernards-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Le will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web foundry, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I find an immense optimism for this next generation of the web," added Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clerical celebration of Victoria Cross World War I
The only cleric of the Church of England that won Victoria Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belengise and Lechacort.
However, he was killed by a Sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
The Saturday saw a memorial stone discovered by his two grandsons in a park in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his cousins, Michael Vann, said that it was "a brilliant symbol" that the stone had to be discovered exactly 100 years after the victory of the Grand Prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kor led his away to the other side of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of fog and fire from on-the-spot guns and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fire line and with the "great courage" led the line forward before going to a rifle on the spot alone and lost consciousness three from the troops.
Lt Kur was killed by a German Sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of Nanoh were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a girland behind the park, which was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Team.
Michael Vann said that "he was feeling highly honoured that he played a role in this para and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA parties remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see Bellator 206 packaged to end deprived of seeing the main event.
The list by San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown directly during the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousesi and Roy Mac Donald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained alarmed when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after being raised until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to the child's card as "some kind of fun."
"It is a government regulation that on 6 a.m. that content was therefore inappropriate for children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Cooker said that he would work on their schedule to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the repetition, we probably can fix something," said Cucker.
"But there are currently Sunday morning six and we will not be able to fix by Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Imminence, when the broadcast was transferred there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, thinking it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I promise you the next time you don't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to deliver more to the parties and instead to go too far.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sex
The Olympic Star tom Daley says that it grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to make a success.
The 24-year-old man said he had not realized until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Laurent Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he was less interested in her than in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the ongoing programme, Christy Young, took a few months to cash due to illness.
While it appeared as an isolated person on Laverne's first programme, Daley said that he felt "less than" others he is growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to please boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sex.
The Bronze Olympic medium for two years became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used its appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live free and free and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner three times said that when he came to love a man - US film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married the winner of Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things of such a young age - he went to his first Olympics of 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later - said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar good experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than Olympic gold media.
The medal of my Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, yeah'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized it wasn't necessary," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life -- that I was hanging in front of a crowd from countries in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the first choice of his song - Heather Small Proud - which was compatible with him on the way to the Olympics and still started the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson no longer in form on the bank in the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will record the Saturday when he plays his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form to avoid being an important, not so happy stage.
Mikkelson, who plays at the 12-time record biannual event, remained on the bank from Captain Jim Furyk to Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as was often for the United States, the great winner of five times his field of day between being supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope of correcting the concerns.
One who never gave the ball a right even at the completion of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for Le golf National's difficult course, where the long distance has multiplied once and for all to punish misfits.
And if the course alone is not of enough heart beat, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the exact plates of the British Open Francesco Molinari, which joined Tommy Fletwood, new for the season, to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below the start of the 12 single games, start well, the Mikkelson game can show that it is a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tucked on my back and laid his hand around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He Hall of Famer and contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two parts.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, like others."
Mikkelson will exceed the record of Nick Faldo for the most parts of the Ryder Cup that were played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career which has rather never reached its initial record fillings.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"He's getting old, curious, funny, he likes to talk with people, and a very good man to have in the team room," explained.
"I think the younger players at the age have been happy to criticize him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn that the big front position can disappear quickly
Thomas Byjorn, the European master, is aware of the experience that a position at the top measured before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed on a comfortable journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 game in Valdrama, where one side led by Seve Balesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans but ended with a narrow true margin of 141.2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a large front position in Valdarma; we had a large front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valdarma, where we won, but with little," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to be on the front with 10-6 in Le golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team who has not yet finished everything.
You're still going with yourself and your body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It is not finished until you have brought the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what he tries to embrace this trophy, and let the focus remain there.
I've always said, focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is -- the biggest players in the world."
pleased with how his players played on a hard golf course, Byorn added: "I never go step oltrè from me in this.
There is still a different challenge.
Still concerns the individual performances we see, which is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when things are out individually, then you'll be tested for your full capacity as a golf.
This is the message you want to pass on to players, which comes out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he wants to leave and get out of his best, too."
In contrast to Byorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that are Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing as Europe did the "Medinah miracle".
"I remember at least a word from it," he replied in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We still have 12 important items, but you want to come up to that start as soon as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum comes on one side, place a lot of pressure on those mid-points.
We established our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do some miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McLory in the best game, with Paul Cassey, Justin Rose, Jon Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Paulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn said about his singles options.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest German Navali Fleet had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Great Wartime fragages that are ageing, but there will not be until next year at least because of systems with increasing defects and costs, the local media will be reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfaltz", the main ship of the bright new flags of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a speaker for the military.
The vessel was to join the Navali fleet in 2014, but the post-shipment problem issues dictate the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that ordered the Navali fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the old Bremen class fragates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an exhibition of missiles against aircraft and against ships as well as some caustic technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic symptoms.
Other important tasks include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the newest fryings for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delay means that the ships of the latest technology – which mentioned allows Germany to project power off its coast – will already be old by the time they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 bad luck strip was seen in the news last year, when the German Navali fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned to Bloham & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navali fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media quoted a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
The defects in software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class squares.
In addition, it appeared that the ship is overburdened to reduce its performance and to limit the ability of the Naval fleet to increase future updates.
The “Rheinland-Pfaltz” of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as vessels of a similar class used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to a defective hardware, the whole project price - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from €2.2 billion initial.
The problems of the most emerging are becoming of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navali fleet currently "has a lack of ships to withstand deployment."
The officer said that the problem grew over time, as ancient vessels were commissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
It complained that none of the frats of the Baden-Werttemberg class could join the Naval fleet.
The National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of the bats at night
A new ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of single mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pastrelles and soprano as well as long-hand brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverwe Garden in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of all recording noises will check the frequency of the bat calls at night and what species you are doing.
They will then be produced a habitat map and a report that will create a detailed picture of their behaviour landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The night turtle population in Scotland and around the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are under a threat from building and development work affecting habitats and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines may also pose a risk, such as poison paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, due to their nottourin hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch prey.
They use sophisticated ecology techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve of Scotland’s night turtles in the Thrive land in Dumfries and Gallowy, which welcomes eight of the tenth species of Scotland’s night turtles.
The property manager David Thompson states that the property is their ideal territory.
"Here in Thereave we have a very good area for the bats at night," he said.
"We have the old building, many veterinary trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much more about the no-known bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that an unintentional destruction of a single mother's home could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, kill or distress them or destroy their walls.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Trust Officer for the Night Conservation, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We have much to learn about our bats and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims as soon as lawyers are ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "should promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's leading player and Juventus was accused of rape an American woman, named Katryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was alleged to have paid $37,000 that day to say nothing about the accident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, cited the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or five times as he looked at the camera.
"We must promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I am a happy man and everything goes well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to court Dr Spiegel on allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of privacy suspects", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Following their meeting in discotheca, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the players' room, where he allegedly recovered it from the anus, according to documents submitted at the District Court of County Clark in Nevada.
Myorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his recovery after the alleged accident and told her that it was "99 per cent" "good man" disappointed with the "one per cent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she felt "wrathed by retaliation" and was concerned that "is publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to change the solution as it is being traumatised by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo had arrived to join Real Madrid by Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer followed the Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret forever" that it has lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader in the manufacturing of cars after Brexit, said business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of "an concern" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burundi, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the director director of Toyota in Burundi.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its Minni plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Today's Toyota production line works on a "time-suit" basis, with parts reaching every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for vehicles made according to the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be a barrier to the border that industry says may lead to delays and shortcomings of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow, as I say, not only success to enjoy at present but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvlaris, who worked in Burundi for 24 years and is the defendant of the Union in the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
Government spokesperson said: "We have reached an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
The risky Donald Trump meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed by another week" as he continued the fight against the Supreme Court's candidature Bert Kavanaugh, said White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein handles the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump and Russia's aid and a potential obstacle to justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to expel the deputy lawyer-general or not, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, inducing Washington's screaming for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire clothes to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which was at the time the United Nations was in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers" he did not expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid misbehavior with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of misconduct, Dr Christine Blasy Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a week period, which delayed further the full vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "Because a date has not been set for this, it may be this week, and it may take place the following week because of all other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists challenge this assertion: Sanders have not been organizing a press meeting in White House since 10 September.
The presenteder Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "who try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that a direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president conducts further sessions of Questions and Answers compared to any previous president," she added, without quoting any evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, this is much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen this done many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the journals.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he acted in a calm and sometimes strange way in front of groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Bressit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain behind the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remained for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its evolving public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the exit have continued, which are moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Links from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and we wish you very much to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Conducts Emergency surgery After Suffering Injury in Rass
The response Christion Abercrombie of Tennesse State Tigers carried out emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday when his team lost against the vanderbilt Computers by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennesse.
The main coach of the State of Tennesse Road Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went on the sideline and as he fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a spray and took him back for further examination.
An official from the State of Tennesse told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/extensive of the injury" and the State of tennis is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennesse after leaving Illinos.
Saturday as a whole he had five taxis before coming out of the game, which led to a total of 18 taxis of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more on ball tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more on ball tax when buying property in the UK in excess of money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on non-tax payers in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise up to €120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of ball tax when they buy property in the UK - with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target those who earn a higher wage.
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with over-payments boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment – which is additional to the current ball tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purchases – could be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to approximately 120 million a year.
Some 13 per cent of new properties built in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, who are increasing prices, making it more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the purchase of housing.
Many rich areas of the country - in particular in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in ball tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high property prices by seize and not using land, and urged Ms. May to abandon allowances on affordable homes to correct the "hospitable situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms that affect the eye, including checks on rent and the end of "no fault-free" expulsions.
He also wants to give councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: " Last year I said that I will devote my job to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means adjusting the broken market of our housing.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy houses as many as the UK's single residents.
For many people the dreams of having a house have become too far off, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sanderland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to become the director of Scotland at one time.
The 42-year-old Scottish welcomes the challenge of raising the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This summer is going to the stadium of Light after guiding St. Meyren back to the Escotish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as players.
I found B cap and nothing more," Ross said to the BBC Sport of Scotland.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and this always remains the thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity comes only if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Rose as manager of Sanderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Atlantic states that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such names established in such a large club, while he had previously refused the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswick.
"As of now, the success for me will be based on "I can" deliver this club for the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I succeed in taking the club back there."
Ross has been in his career as manager for only three years, after a period of assisting chief in Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegance to the third category, and transformed St Myren from the edge of the regexin to the winners of the post-securit title.
And Ross says that now they feel more comfortable than how he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Megan and Hamilton Academic.
As to when Alloa took over, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"I generally thought that the post of manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, living decent lives, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I simply feel that the position of manager is appropriate for me.
I have always wanted to manage and now do this, and I feel that throughout my adult life I am now feeling the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer push is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of UK pops that are in difficulty but put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, pubs and bars groups saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales – but figures revealed that restaurant earnings decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who collected the figures, said: "Further work and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern for the previous month of June, when sales in pops increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were even more affected.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars the main sales of which are drinks were those which were the most well gone in terms of financial results compared to the previous period, while restaurant sales decreased.
Pubs whose main sales are food also suffered in heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food fell to 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the RSM analysts with regard to entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or sports remain the main factors in terms of sales on the market of ‘tuke-ways’.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year after one year will in particular be of great weight in addition to constant cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come in a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and time alone could advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August will provide the necessary rest."
The growth of total sales in pops and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry to the UK’s pops, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than €9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
Survey reveals that 1 in 5 children - some at 11 years of age - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "Insta's Follies" pages
News has great fears that sexual content is being replaced
Twenty percent of students said they had a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some at 11 years of age - are creating social media accounts hidden by adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in Insta's portfolios - reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being replaced.
Twenty percent of students said that they operate a "main" account available to show their parents, while having others private.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "Steprani."
Research, from Digital Awarence UK and from Headmasters and Headpresses (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Atlantic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Atlantic board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the course and not of the course that most has won the medals and President Ian Beatie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beatie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution and help run the sport in Scotland."
The United States, which won the 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four gold medals of Olympic Games and which is now a regular critical of BBC, has been unable to go after having suffered from a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today gives me a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a job but I recovered completely, I learned how to resuscitate and today I’m doing agile exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Maternal pump advertising comparing mothers to cattle gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an announcement comparing breast-feeding mothers with milking cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the first breast pump in the world that can be worn and does not make noise " , the consumer technology company Elvie issued an announcement inspired by a video of ironic music to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a hammock filled with cattle's straw with a disc that includes a lyric such as: "Yes, I will bite myself but I have no tail" and "In case I don't notice them, they're no hounds but my masters."
The coach continues: "Pop out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook website of the company caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which claim to shed light on the milk industry's "terrorism".
Someone wrote "It was a very wrong decision that cattle were used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth.”

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Reigion is really cut off from reality."
Others defended the announcement, with a woman admitted that she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a generic idea.
If I were still breast - feeding, I would buy one.
The pumping would have made me feel the same as a cow.
The announcement is a little or a little gardened but I've taken out of it.
This is a genetic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "sheep".
This is not an ad that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with out-of-eye pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their husbands say they feel like cattle.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, does not have any wire or tube and stays in a breast-feeding bar without giving it in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a Revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and proactive launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing fun and in a way that can be related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the Cataluk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children walked without words to a Tinda Camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed much, partly because retorical and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration have made it more difficult to put children together with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and were afraid that if they presented themselves to take care of a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their boats would have had to submit fingerprints, and that the data would have been shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"approximately 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the home of sponsors are here illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to seek these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the sex workers.
Many will appear through a video telephone conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be immediately deported.
According to filter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to their violent expression or attempt to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the city of tents without giving sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or without telling their partners strength can lead to trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the "occupant forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to retire immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moam also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as prime minister of the defence, said that foreign forces were on the Syrian territory illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They should retire immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mowalem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this noble battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the land in the war-destructed country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mowalem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and attached "in some Western countries" to "farming radical fears" that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there was a political agreement between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major strong Idlib rebel created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mowalem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target Al-Qaidas including the front fighters linked to Al-Qaida, who "will be destroyed".
UN sent Stephen de Mistur hopes that it will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the re-election as long as, as many free viewers hope to end his presidency in advance.
What would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale that has ever been in the presidency!"
To date, it appears that viewers have not yet done so.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and the "The Rachel Madow Show" of MSNBC increased cable television ratings by up to 3.5 million viewers in the evenings of the major news.
"This is a situation that attracts people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Barer, presenter of the ABC drama "Designed Survivoor", about the secretary of the cabin who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of the veterinary treaties and author of "Just the Fony Parts: And a Few Hard Truths Abbott Snaking Into the Holywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
It recalls a taxi ride in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Why did you wear me," she told me Mrs. Scovell.
In this case there is a value of entertainment.
Unlike anything else on TV, the titles of the stories from Washington can undoubtedly determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And this goes, however, beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following an expert panel in six discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "deep background" for his book "Fear", the cow skin bomber ("honour clothing", said The Washington Post) of Paul Manfort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomicals from Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he's doing makes it as if it's a real show is that every night he's been doing something to you," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wellhouse Intertanament and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing case and the development in the daily plot of the Trump programme (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one event because you would otherwise fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Feliss this week, outside the weather was hot at 80 degrees in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside to see MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be taken from front of the television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those exciting programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilisation," said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money received from outside for the most stringent racing in the mid-term White House election
It is not surprising that the 17th Consequent District of Pennsylvania is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of consular districts which have acquired two operators in a race for the same chair.
This recently re-established the pits of the Suburban district of Pittsburgh, the Democratic Representative of Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the twelve old districts of Pennsylvania, which extends much to the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally loaded in favour of the Republics.
The race in the 17 new districts provided a difficult competition between the financial campaign between the weapons of finance of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a family name in Pennsylvania after winning a few differences in the March special election followed by a great deal for the eighteenth Consequent District of Pennsylvania.
That seat belonged to a Republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States Like to Penalise El Salvador Give Support to China, then decided not to do so
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a reception meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the administrative team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the Department of State decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama again on the " recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan" said the speakers of the Department Heather Nauert, in a declaration at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid in 2017, including nuclear controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have weighed the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in efforts not to move migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticized to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of putting the administration on the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three sent Americans returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or severe punishment from Washington.
White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the anonymity condition.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Müller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress moves to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a court of his peers.
This involves many uncertainties, and I do not have the aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is it equivalent to its equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent to which the fight is prolonged.
In 1938, German officials would have been ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, which had been held back by the West and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We have failed, and we have lost the opportunity to avoid the years of mass destruction that follow.
The course of history turns to such inflexibility points, and the inexplicable course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today the Americans face many of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr Trump expelled Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be registered in a secret and spectrum that is not suitable for office.
Mr Rosenstein said that the report of The Times was not accurate.
"How will we respond if the investigation of F.B.I. a new request for Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and disproved evidence?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for a Congress that will keep Mr Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time to move into democracy.
But I believe I won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
Mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She was able to live, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light candles on that table with saturation.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of the Ringers is an optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the knowledge that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive equal result they brought in Spain against Vilarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
Injury in the knee prevented the griever Graham Dorans from making his first appearance of the season to the same result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villerreal is a good team," said the young man of 31 years.
"We came to the game with the belief that we were able to get something and get out with a point.
We may have won it towards the end but, everything at all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European night again.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good outcome in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure that we can continue to do our best and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, between what happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is now a sense of positiveness.
The team is good and the boys are very happy; the training is good.
I hope we can now do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be consulted, few people were talking to their family members about this.
Approximately half of the subjects in the Nationalvide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a member of the family to direct them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, a vice president of the national life insurance business.
You should start that way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor for determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long run: Avoid legal vacancies.
Find a healthcare regimen to choose a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a measure for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to take financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Explain these details in a written plan for your readiness.
"Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See if that plan is ready."
A man has been hit several times by an airship in IFRcombe
A man was hit several times by an airship as he walked to his home after night.
The victim, aged 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when I was hit by titres in his owner, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to his life and the police have called for witnesses.
Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Paul in Indonesia on Friday, said the officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
In the light of the above, the Commission considers that the aid measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
In Paul, more than 16,000 people were deported after the disaster.
These are some key facts about Paul and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Paul is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow lake on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a region that extends more than 300 km (180 km) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The stay, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299, 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Modalities, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paul and Dongala were hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, tsunami also hit the western side of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of the Semitic Pacific Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Aeh province of Indonesia at the top of Sumatra triggered tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 hit southern Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, which triggered tsunamis that hit the southern coast with great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a strength of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital city of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a strength of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, beyond Sumatra, which triggered tsunamis with a height of 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Low earthquake hit Pediae Jaya's resistance in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and fatal tsunami invasion.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that would take place.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
The largest Child of Sarah Paulin arrested on Domestic Violence Cases
The former governor of the Americas and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of attack.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, who interfered with a report of domestic violence and who resisted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known female attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hands.
Palin is being held in Matt-Su Pretial Facility and is being held on an unconditional loan of $500, reported by the KTU.
He appeared the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "of course, not guilty" when he was asked to give his reason, reported the network.
Paulin is facing three crimes of Class A, i.e. he may be imprisoned for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day-to-day prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Tod Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with a domestic attack, which interfered with the report of an offence of domestic violence, and which held an armsarm in his possession while he was in possession of an accident.
His girl claimed to be hers at once in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups following a comparison between her child's violent behaviour and post-rural stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just a little outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakar.
On the media they circulate videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paul when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are requesting that the suspected terrorist attack of NYC be punished with rare death.
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayflo Saipov, who is suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York that killed eight people being sentenced to death - rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a road attack on bicycles along the West Side Highway in Low Mannant, by flying people and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intently" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to claim the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of charges carry a possible death penalty.
As a member of the Security Council of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’.
When describing the way Saipov carried out this attack "dangerous, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Syfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Laure Deactt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnuco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last launched a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the killing of two drug suppliers but finally in September 2009 was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after having been convicted of consciousness to carry out a survey for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
POB: Sympov, Uzbekstan national, has shown a lack of removance in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, told the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the chief of charges.
He also requested that an ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, said the police.
He replied innocently to 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We think that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty reason for life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
The Sypov defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" .
The former Head of the UK said that politicians had to "feel under pressure" by the Eurosceptic – as suggested by one of Theresa May’s own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the Government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had so far "had come out" if Mr. Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile her very divided positions has been highlighted by Tories, who is not in favour of Brexit, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on the right path among the attacks by Brexiera, the anti-Brekitit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and force the Eurosceptists and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "caos".
Mr Bone said to ally Leave Mens Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to put aside the plan of Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage be given a high social position and that he be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out so far," he said.
MP Wellingbook added: "I will defend the Brexit but we need to abandon the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be civil servants.
We must make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their understanding and must remain completely unrealistic."
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitier of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, where she told the journalists: "I want to just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The plan of non-polar Chequers with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who are actually those who go on the streets and who first vote for us.
Please forget the plan of Chequers and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the Rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would have gone back from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get back from Brestit and we're here today to tell them "We're not going to let you go straight if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilised in Bresti the army of the people of this country that has made us successful and will not be spent until we have become an independent, self-government and proud UK."
In the meantime, anti-Brekit went to Birmingham before doing a two-hour strike in the centre of the city.
Following the launch of this WEkend group, a small number of activists turned bankers in writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against the Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who held a high social position in the Labour party, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had suffered with party apps as soon as the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, to the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole farm.
The idea of Brexit does not exist well," he added.
Warren intends to " carefully examine" the possibility of going out for the presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will " carefully examine the possibility of leaving for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is frequently critical of President Donald Trump, will be issued for re-election in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was in the centre of the speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to go out for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
He was arrested in connection with the murder of LSU Syms by shooting
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that he was suspected of being arrested in connection with the murder by shooting of the LSU's baseball video Sims player that took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m. News Conference ET.
Week they released a shooting video, where they asked for help to identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed by a pilot near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, the chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a head injury and eventually died as a result of this."
Wayde came in to defend his partner and was hit by a pilot from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had an arm, and admitted to shooting at Wede Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept under custody in the East Paris Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a young man who had six feet and who was raised in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 last season starts and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 credits per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton approaches to get the world title after his team orders gave him the victory against Sebastian Vetteel
On Saturday, from the moment Valteri Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would have an important part of the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Botas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop zones and allowed Hamilton to leave with others at the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
Hercedes stopped in the stop zone after another turn and came out just after Vettel, but Hamilton continued following a few-wheel action with a wheel which led to the driver of the Frewer leaving the inside with difficulty because of the risk of falling back after a double movement to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the rear row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first turn at a close of his years at the age of 21.
It was then in the lead for most of the race by not changing its tyres with the aim of rapidly completing and exceeding Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in 44 turns but was unable to step up his step in the eight remaining rounds while Raikkonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valters did his very good work throughout the weekend and it was a truly gentrum told me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get the first and second place," said Hamilton.
What Was a Real Physical Appearance
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday trial in connection with her insistence that she did not find out the letter from Christine Blasy Ford that she was accusing the nominated Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking in a rolly in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "villious and uncomfortable and not honest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and unhappy and not honest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosure of information and then say "no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you discovered any information?
Remember its answer... I discovered the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, you do not.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
We found... No, he did not reveal," he added, while I imitated the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was discovered earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the detection was coming from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not reveal her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"He asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her refusal was not welcomed by the president, who during the Saturday evening holiday commented: "You know what I know, that was a very bad physical behaviour.
It may not have been discovered, but that is the worst physical behaviour I've ever seen."
Continued with his defence of the designated Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They are seeing the virtue, disgruntling, they don't care about those who hurt, those who make the brakes in the wheels to get power and control," said the president according to reports from Mediate.

Dundee Stars made a ransom for the loss of the Week Elite League against Belfest Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants achieved an advantage of two early golls in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.

Francois Bouchhard obtained the same score for Dundee before two Gools of Lukes Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who after several losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the three previous games.

Air Traffic controller Dies to ensure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being regarded as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people succeeds safely in Landing.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered tsunamis.
Strong armies continued to control the area and many were caught in Debris in the city of Paul.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for survival, the 21-year-old young Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower he was watching at Paul's Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Juffir Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was in the runway, could leave safely.
He then exceeded the traffic control towers when he thought it was happening.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Paul.
"When we hear about it we feel a big window," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under dispersal, while many could not be reached," said agency spokesperson Sutopo Puro Nugroho.
The waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Paul on which Sunday will become mass burial.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance enters the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Cross Red of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President of Indonesia Joko Sunodo arrived in Paul Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask all of you to work night and day to complete any task related to evacuation.
Ready?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Luxembourg in which more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is lost after the plane accident in the lake
The airline that was operating a flight crashed in the Pacific line in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuating from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one man was passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuk Island airport.
On Friday the officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Naval fleet both said that the Irish aircraft in the lake was a little away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came very low.
"This is something really good," said Janees.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to old up to the exit of the emergency on the sinking aircraft.
He said that the flight assistants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered from a small injury in his head.
The U.S. Naval fleet said that seafarers who were working closely to improve moll also helped save by using an inflated boat to carry passengers to the beach before the plane was rooted in around 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Date from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents registered with PNG but no accident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a nighttime schedule on which a woman has lost her life
It concluded its evidence of the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while he was alive.
The Analyst of the Department of Justice of the United States Paul Rolllett witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile records to gather together information on the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night he died.
According to Rollett, he received localisation data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamberers on that night that he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile date showed that he was with Chamberers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in town at the time.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was in the truck of Sanford, Sanford said that he was "slanding, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another intolerance was that Tellis said that he had known Chamberers for two weeks when he died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rolllett said that some time after the death of Chamberers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chamberers from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip Hop?
Three hip-hop artists must challenge the gender's negative perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claims that the hip Hop has moved beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They must go back to his roots and make the hip-hop conscious again.
Artists such as The Fuges and Commonwealth have seen a recent re-emergence in the UK with artists such as Cala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nancy from NY hit a couple for kicking her after a message "racist"
Nancy from New York is starting a couple for discriminatory expulsion after she received a message by mistake from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist, and compare the case with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child supervisor, Giselle Maurice, was of a dark trailer when she arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEE OTHER PERSONS," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Ms Maurice twice.
Having noticed her gross error, Placeo-Flexman felt "scommunity" and dismissed Ms Maurice, saying that her former African-American grandmother had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting for the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is seeking compensation in respect of the dismissal, and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, can't do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they were racist, saying that Ms Maurice's expulsion was the most reasonable thing they could do, because they were afraid that they could not trust her after they defended her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But if you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke with the golf, even if it was a mistake?
Is your newborn baby?
And let's go."
When comparing the case with "extortion", Placeco said that it had been only two months since his wife had the baby and was located "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like that?
It is not a good thing to do," he added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced to the couple on the social media, where it resulted in their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Padington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to talking bears
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very entertaining to know now what we know about Padington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC camerman before he was inspired to write the book of children from small play bears, would certainly have been optimistic that if his work had been rejected, she would have added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "expressed but humiliated with sorrow" after his death last year.
About Padington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never stayed talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with it himself," she said.
"But since Padington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: being proud of them even if it wasn't you who's got something.
I think he would have looked at the success of Padington in that way.
Although he was his creation and his imagination, he always gave merit to Padington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her last peace on the phone
As soon as her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where the doctors worked to save her life but was all for nothing.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last peace.
And so I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slowly.
She had died some time before and began to close everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back."
Eventually, Ms Ednan-Laperose, who has been crying for the loss of her daughter, took up the plane together with the other passengers – who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low risk, and the tears began to fall all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and to be jealous.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of infected women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from removing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were attaching cards on a West bridge with inspired messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, living in Lidney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They were always saying that his smile was burning every room."
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was located "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was what he found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm afraid this will be the cause of another terrible event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "To inform people that you can open your heart or meet them, even if you are a friend.
Do not put in silence - there is a need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ms Davies, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not much after his mother's death.
"He wasn't saying that they were feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noted a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their displays and made no contact with them with eyes or something.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight it: "Leave an empty in the family.
Refrigeration.
But all of us must continue with our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI starts an investigation
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked for in time-limited investigation, limited in purpose - maybe we would have brought a little unity," said Mr. Flicke in Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was being "cracking" among a partisan parasite who raised roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their independence is due as a whole to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November – if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, in that case they will severely weaken their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was on the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they actually occupy 51 Republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allows Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea "less" below Kim
The number of deserters in North Korea for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
When quoting data from the Ministry for the Unification of the South Sea, Park Byoong-seug, he said that last year there was 1,127 change in party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates required by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the North Sea would eventually be offered South Korea citizenship.
Soul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Many of them flee by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to share compared to the well-protected Demiliated Area (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country with force.
The relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on the stagnation of denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho attached to the US sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos calls Bert Kavanaugh "sterical", saying that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The Leader of the Nance Pelos Chamber called the person nominated to the Supreme Court Mr Bert Kavanaugh "sterical" and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
Pelos made these comments in an interview on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman had ever acted in that way, they would have said "sterical", said Pelos about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Committee of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasy Ford when both were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and sneezing when he was talking about his family and the years of his secondary school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling on the allegations against him "assistance of the grotteska and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos stated that she believes that Kavanaugh's witnesses proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself with those declarations and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos was dismissed when it was asked whether she tried to accuse Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, so he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court in which he is currently in," said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelos added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered to be conservative justice.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether it changed certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not in the right place that a person with extreme prejudices goes to the court and waits to say, "very good," said Pelos.
And women need to exercise their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we are upset," she told me, Sir Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what you say?"
She added, "It has helped me a lot of woman who was reached somewhere else, who said that she was even crying when she was upset, but developed a technique that meant that when she was upset and began to cry, she was telling the person she was talking to, "Probably she thinks she's upset because she's crying.
I'm upset."
And then did not stop.
And I thought it was a brilliant thing."
The crying is allowed as a way to get out of his great anger in part because they are basically misinterpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where one of them found me crying with inexplicable anger, was when an older woman took me from the whole body of neck - a cold manager who always feared some of it - and carried me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and feel happy they've been able to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and came out of the election, Ms. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of leaving herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-designed decision," she said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to be elected, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she decided that she would not go out for the election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to her men would only give her $250.
"This is what they think I'm gonna take a discount?" she said.
When she did her speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - that she was grateful to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and angry towards sex - which has been committed.
"Probably I thought I had a brake these strong," reminded Ms. Schroeder of the way in which the media reacted to it.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"Is she crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of air bombs opening the US-China trade war were disturbing, while the battle is still over, a lack of agreement between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, saying experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by charging the main Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (α 150 billion), and effectively tax all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing was upset every time in the same way, while more recently she was presenting fees of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the claims, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the US will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade-war pressures can support China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions to start an economic case in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than that previously recognised by the viewers," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre, which is a reflection group.
Syria is located "prepared" that refugees return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs

All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and their lives.

Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moam said that the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the country destroyed.
But it stressed that it will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the section.

There was a time in the morning when we brought some pressure on Europe.
Argumenta.
To Thomas we download the hat.
He is a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will be reunited, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cap Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 young men I love and I am proud to be a master.
You have to grab the hat and cut your head.
Play better than she."
Update on Red Tide: The concentrations decrease in Penellas, Mante and Sarasota
The most recent report by Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Campa Bay area.
According to the FWC, excessive alkali growth conditions in isolated areas are being reported in the county areas of Pinellas, Mantete, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - suggesting decreased concentrations.
The Red Tide, which is excessive seaweed growth, extends about 130 miles of the coast from the top of Pinellas to the sub-Lee countries.
Isolated areas can be found around 10 miles off the coast of Hillsbourg County, but at fewer sites related to last week.
Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
However, the Commission considers that there is no evidence of the existence of an economic advantage in the region.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the county of Penellas, Manner, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
