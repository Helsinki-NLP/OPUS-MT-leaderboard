The reason I left the PDP.
The aged head of the Council of Tataria, Jacob Dogara, explains some reasons why he left the PDP and returned to the APC.
If not forgotten, the former President of the Society, Jacob Dogara, referred to the PDP, returned to the APC this week.
Dogura says that when he stopped suffering the mistreatment of the governor of PDP in Bacuhi, which finally helped him to succeed in the 2019 ’ s, Gira gathered to leave the community and return to his place of APC.
A major reason for me to be generous was the way PDP rules in the state of Bacuhi.
Everyone knew what it was like to dance in the election of the governor of the state who was the former prime minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, and played the part of the devouring governor, Mohammed Abobacar.
Now, however, I was poor at the state of Bala.
Instead of continuing to live in the PDP, I was forced to step aside and move back to where I came from.
Dogura wrote an e-mail from PDP sent to the leader of the menu community, Bogoro C, and Bacuhi.
Finally, he said that he had just shown the rest of the rulers where they were to set things straight behind, and he was not the anointed and the discreet.
I would hurry and let them go.

APC Posted Governor Neja and Jukura to the University of Leaders Hausa Newspapers.
In an announcement by the APC movement, the government of the Nejai, Alhaji Abus Sani Bello, and the effort to bring conflict into the society, accused the U.S.
The paper, which was the leader of the Islamic Union and the State Secretary of the Republic of East Mohammed Liman, explained that for the six years that the State party had signed, Naira had to receive 512 million dollars.
The document continued to state that the meeting that the governor had called for waters and canals, which he held on the night of the last Sunday, would help to keep the civil strife going, as they said it would.
In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, “the Government of the Republic of Nigeria has tried to divide the members of the society by organizing, by means of illegal, rainy and moderate meetings, all of which are cast upon the leaders of the community, on the basis of a written statement to the secretary of the society, in order to do research.”
He continued to say that in the six years that followed, the number of people in the Society had risen to 512 million.
He said that what he found to be a member of the Committee on the Rights of the Congo, which was formed on July 25, 2020, by the President of the Republic to organize the problems between the civil society and the courts.
However, we pay for social security officials, as well as for other social activities, such as the distribution of funds and the handling of social problems, such as health care, because of the lack of access to government aid, rather than because of the illegal use of social services, and because of the fact that we have been killed, we challenge everyone’s right to a fair trial.
As I have explained, the chief executives of the former state’s executives were the chief executives of the former state, who were assigned to the country where we worked with the senior committees and other committees that now occupy the state’s twenty - five executives, who had been divided into sections.
Thus, it is a mistake for everyone to have been executed without due cause, almost injustice, with the struggle to find the wrong tongue playing on it, rather than on one committee that was set up to investigate how the community was killed and who had it set up.
Out of the walls where a fugitive is accused of having been convicted of rape, he is a member of a society that has failed, and I thus challenge everyone on this issue for which he has testified, thus proving his accusations in every way.
Now that we stand firm on the voice of the APC community from which it belongs or from which it is rooted, it is clear that any reproach on society or on the part of any leader of society should be written down by the committee that is responsible for its conduct, as explained in section 21 (B) (b), and (d) on page 82 of the community order.
Thus, the seamen and the social hubs are free to swim, especially if they are eager to seize the commission and therefore have no influence on the outcome.
For this reason, they were the competent leaders of the civil society that were recognized in the State, on the evening of 21st and the sixth paragraphs of the resolution on page 87 of the Society’s Staff Regulations, and anything that would otherwise be of no benefit to them.
It was wrong for you to have the right to cut ties with court officials and superiors.
He said that the countries that you agreed to participate in the plenary meeting were not members of the Society’s Social Committee, which was composed by General Muhammad Garba and Hon.
The rain - mining committee and the Society’s leader, Mohammed Imm, must not be led by the government but by the civil society leaders.
The paper was all about the document, and the Governor of Sani Bello recalled that the issue of living up to the promises made to the State during the civil war, and of traveling with civil society’s parents in the government, as well as how everyone would benefit from all the institutions by means of political power, which is the problem of government and society.
The paper commends the membership councils of the countries you attended and calls attention to all the problems of society, not to the society in which you are aware of your own disease, and to your refusal as a social law.
Hence, there was a need for the chairman of the Committee on Economics to draw the attention of the Governors of Sani Bello to a position that would enable him to remain neutral in the political affairs of the state.

The people of that country were called upon to guard against the use of all kinds of food for their health.
To be remembered, the cook Grace Olsambo called on the Nigerians to avoid eating fruit produced with the calcium carbide.
Olsumbo explains that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most common source of wood in the world for the making of wood products.
Studies have shown that the names of such workers and the names of different trade items as the one used for the trade use of these products indicate that in many days the tree’s produce was displayed.
Olasambo explains that one of the most difficult factors to detect is the use of this standard to show the interest of health care to the sick.
As a result, the disease has been diagnosed with leprosy, malaria, osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis, mouth, and so forth.

The Community’s Economics and Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of life in all creation, and we cannot live without food.
That is why the Chinese judge was so eager to secure the wealth of the country’s food market.
In the past 71 years since the fall of the Republic of China, the country has had great achievements in terms of the world’s food resources, and the number of people in the country under siege has been estimated at 1.4 billion.
This effort helped to explain why China has contributed to a global famine, just as the Chief of the Conservation and Agriculture Agency of Sin Zhang Wefeng explained that, from 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of the solution to hunger in front of all travel activities in the country.
But in recent times, some people and parts of the Western world have been “anxieties ” about the matter — whether China can raise its own nation in the shadow of the COVID-19 respiratory system in all parts of the world?
We thank them very little for their new surroundings in the world.
Under the Communist Union in China, the country has won a victory over the man of the struggle for food.
The issue of providing Chinese with enough food was one of the most prominent institutions of the JKS system.
At the end of the previous week, the secretary - general of the JKS Police Committee, chief of China’s headquarters, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop stealing food, indicating that everyone knew that any food and all the hard work was being done.
Although this year the influence of COVID 19 on the world’s economy has been detrimental to the economy of China, China can provide an abundance of food for its own nation.
The Alkalum, produced by China’s Board of Directors on the size of the land’s produce, particularly in 2020, shows that the country’s share of rice in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million in the United States, with a capacity of 1.08 million tons — 3.9% compared with the year 2019.
He also said that Ke Bingseng, an elderly head of the Chinese farm, had the biggest successes in terms of the wealth of the food market compared to the beginning of the shift and the beginning of the purpose of changing the home and opening the door to electricity.
Huang Jikun, director of the Center for Research on the Purposes of Farming at the University of Pecking, explained in an interview with the representative of The China Science Daily, that the most challenging challenge currently facing China is in the next 2 to 3 years, or China may reduce the amount of wheat with oil and its storage capacity in corn reserves.
Now the amount of grain each person receives is up to 474 pounds (400 kg) of food each year.
And now China has access to some of the world’s millions of tons of produce in order to raise domestic animals.
In a new setting, concerned parties should cool their minds, wash their heads, or keep their minds in the dark.
Chineses can raise themselves with their own food.

This role of the Cano Governors in the PDP League, Grand Joseph, explains the reasons for the campaign that the Kano Governors, Umar Ganduje, and others, were in the presence of the Supreme Court.
This was revealed by his lawyer, Bashir al-Mujr, who said that it was the entry of the beast, on the basis of the suspicion of the power of some government-building businesses used by the Kano people.
Not to the governments of Kano and the businessmen, Grand Joseph also grew up in civil society and in public homes and transportation, as well as in the Kano Legal Committees and the Department of Field Affairs.

This mother and the trusted chieftain, Mohammed Buhari, Master Dura, explain that the old age of the so-called anti-Semitic regime in Nigeria is now under way.
Major Dura said that Nigeria had already abandoned the carbon - car program to pay more attention to the dress that was most suitable in 2023.
BBC Hausa published a conversation with a baby in which Mom Dura, the mother of the baby, explained.
This boxing system in Nigeria has not produced an eyeball son since 1999.
Rather than suggesting that Dur be careful about determining who should be the right person, the system should be followed.
Except for the Igbo tribes, the Nethinim responded to his words.
They said that he and his fellow Baharis had taken the throne through the cross and that he would now go out and recommend that it not be followed in 2023.

A violent political outburst that took place on Wednesday, when the National Council for the Igbo Igbo Zala, Ndigbo broke down Major Dura, for the words of the Norwegian leadership’s dog - dog that he had given to the Inyari tribe.
In a poll by Durar, who was a former leader of Muhammedu Buhari, it was proposed that the General Assembly be elected in 2023.
So it was that since his words did not end with the so - called mass of the media, Ndigbo was quick to issue a declaration to Mother Dhura, calling him an unscriptural Scriptural document.
In a announcement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo - tribe association was published in southern Igbo, and in the south, the South - East Shia would be allowed to be issued in 2023, the Igbo - tribe.
Emika Attamah, the archbishop of the Igbo Zela, said that in 2023 he spoke to the tribe of Igbo, the words of the Man Dura like the one of the Nigeriai leadership.
Otherwise, why did Mamman Dura stop him from speaking karba since 2019.
They had expelled Jonathan, and now I had to beat up the southern kingdom of Nigeria’s leader in 2023.
Until he completes the collection of events in the hands of the brother who is now taking the lead in the country, he will also bring out a matter that we do not know about in 2023.
He had to act as an elder to embrace the truth and to embrace it well.
It was not that the heroic words of the country’s leadership emerged in 2023, and the syllable was a selfish, self - centered attitude.

"We should first try to raise up mothers who are too young to pay attention to their children," said Mary Nasir, mother of Nassir, who was involved in a so - and - so that a child can go out and be skind to the point of harming him."
We will also call on the teachers to start preaching with a tone of voice to the parents and to the brothers and sisters who visit their children on their backs.

Modern social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhitesApp, Instigation, and so forth, have often played on political themes, education, and business.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology through the use of social media, to travel around the world, to give their escape or to use their lips in their new life - style.
In a sense, all of this has brought us much progress that young people in the North have made in business, economic, education, and politics.
Many enjoy eating through the use of written messages, e - mails, or other means of transportation.
Unless it is sad to see how other young people use this opportunity to take advantage of the advancement, there are others who are following the leading students of the southernmost part of the country — the world’s most popular social club, in and out of the country, or the making of inscriptions about boxing and taking advantage of the opportunity of judges and academics.
The sign of a lack of understanding lies in the development of the lives of young people in that country.
To the North Media Waters Company in this country, it is a great favor, for it provides young people in the North with a map, a beautiful club and a joke about what young people are doing in the Social Media, making them the most meaningful source of literature, as well as the purpose of the North nation.
It became necessary for us to give that corporation the support it needed, in order to accomplish its good purposes, not only to our northern territory but also to Nigeria in large measure.
I recommend that our young people, especially those who are social workers, come and talk about the North and its customs, and that we make arrangements that will bring about a change for everyone.
Just as our northern leaders of the so - called northern nations, such as Sardos Sakwato, the first North Fascists, and those close relatives, set out to build up the northern nation.
It is argued, however, that the Moriah of war, oppression, and poverty, which, in turn, claimed that it was too little for Nigeria to know about his father’s house!
Thus, when calling on the sky to make progress and to improve the flow of the Kingdom, we do well to call to the north, without prejudice to religion or any other ethnic group, in order to bring forward the region.
If we consider how far north it is now.
Therefore, we need to use God - given wisdom to provide escape and to make wise decisions, for we need to improve our economic and social resources.
The North and the South should have access to border crossings so that their bridges can be operated without the government waiting for them to strike.
In addition to our desire to advance in the North, we attach great importance to education, agriculture, walking about the earth, health care, and science and technology.
There are, however, different ways to do so.
That is how we think the North will fulfill our commission to reach them!
The North is proud to say.

In recent years, some health - care researchers have called on the government side of the crisis to set up a close - knit network to improve the health of the country.
The experiences included the call to meet together for a simple meal and a simple meal held in Apuja.
In the talk “This APC Sadiq Umar is the seat of the North Valley, which represents the North Valley, ” the APC Sadiq Umar stated that Nigeria’s government should take measures to improve the health of the country.
The fact that she did not do so is that the two of us had to cope with a serious problem that led her to so much praise and support from outside.
Despite all the advances made by the government in the field of health care, however, they began to withdraw their aid.

Just as the University of Fascava (FUTA) tried to narrow down the page of PreMIUM TIMEs on the Internet.
The FUTA carried the weight of a rubber to an intrusion button for the pages of the PREMIUM TEMES, a popular magazine in Nigeria.
The web site’s web site, called the roofing platform, has been used by looters to access people’s windows, but it has not been able to do so.
He began to try to enter the haking barrier since February 28, where he struck his tool in the University courts, and accompanied the hang-on through the use of the "data" of the university.
On the other hand, when he competes to access the PREMIUM TIMEs Internet, he makes a retrieving game of GSM.
Five days ’ journey to the front page of the Great PREMIUM TIMES has been affected by the exercise of the first five days ’ journey, but it has not been successful, even though it has been the case with the use of modern technology.
The university did not know that PreMIUM TIMEs had much to do with her plans, which had built the field and a door - to - door barrier that no one could break.
Then PREMIUM also has high - tech colleges on the modern Web site of the Great Red Cross, which confronts the Prince of PreMIUM TIMEs and the Great Guard, the PREMIUM METES Web site.
Any high-level security colleges that have the system are designed to tear down any gunman or soldier who is seeking to shoot him, or to play the part in the oral struggle in the PreMIUM METES database.
Such tools as this Internet Web site have been used to monitor the impact of PRIUM TIMES:
The 8th chapter of the morning begins to run with the greening of the door of the Great PREMIUM TEMES, for it has seen how to close the cockpit into it, and it shakes the hole further.
The next night’s failure was made, and the next morning, at 6:15 p.m., it was re-tested to hour, using “WPScan”, what was being done to detect a heavy - security device similar to that of PREMIUM METES.
Only 90 minutes later, it began to produce a flashlight with a string of computerized system software ("custom screen").
It was early in the morning that he made every effort to close the page of PreMIUM TIME in front of the computer system.
How the Farmer Dealt With the Bereans:
This blacksmith did not know that PREMIUM TEMMES had developed a burrowing brunette and a big city that entered the modern - day media to lock the page or to take away the succulent page.
This lack of knowledge was due to the fact that all his efforts were better than those of old - fashioned humans who could not afford any harm or harm to PreMIUM TIMEs.
On that day, he suffered the loss of his strength because of a DOS attack in the Liccau region of NTP, a long - standing old road that had been used since Kano’s flight.
It was on March 3, that he made all the remaining mental and mental plans for the future, but they were not successful.
This attempt to break the gates of the Great PREMIUM TIMEs came the following days after PreMIUM TIMEs published a report of the competition between President Muhammad Buhari in the Watch Tower, and the former Prime Minister of the Kassa District, Margari Abba Kiri.
Some members of the University of Fasaa League in Akure have charged PREMIUM TIMES with democratizing some of the major barbarics on the Internet, in order to fit in with the Great PREMIUM TIMEs, to corrupt or overthrow it.
Only when PREMIUM TIMEs contacted the University of Futa, she moved away from this large language center of the Great PREMIUM TIMES Internet.
FUTA says that it is only if a fellow student at the university tries to win him a battle, not a fight against FUTA.

There was a woman named Li Yaomei, or Sadia, who was noted for her fight in life and for her success in getting out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the effort, the commitment, and the pursuit of personal interests are deeply rooted in the heart.

Only God had given her vast gifts of wisdom, wisdom, and wisdom, which became an example in the face of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, who suffered from cancer, was diagnosed with cancer, where she was treated up to three times a year.

Then, with the help of the Chinese government, she became more determined than ever to give up her faith.
Its practice is to produce various kinds of plants, using them as grasses.
As a result of her efforts, her business has grown to a very high level, where she has a different office.
No, she invented several machines that would help ease the task.
For example, it takes about 15 minutes to combine one large centimeter, but now, at the same time, it will include up to 5.
No, it also produced a number of other blasting plants that replanted the grass.
Then there was an extra engine that gave her animal food, and she is still selling those cells to search for them.
Seeing the challenge presented by the Master of Sodom and the effort she still makes to improve her life with her staff will surely come to realize that I am the one who has found it.
The work of war, poverty, and the improvement of life is not a matter of attaching the burden to the government.
If governments were to provide support, but people had no ambition or desire to improve their lives by seeking to do things based on their own behavior, there would be no longer any need to do so.
Her experience shows that managing a business or earning income does not require more than cash or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she took into account her circumstances, she used the blessings of her environment to improve her life.
In addition, the teacher of Sodom directed these tasks on the basis of her courageous stand against her husband, who was to flee from her.
In other words, the struggle, the struggle to get married, and the pursuit of personal interests are deeply rooted in the heart.
Then it showed the strength of a woman to change her life and stand firm without the help of anyone else.
This too is a lesson that indicates that a person should stand firm for what he has done, for there is no guarantee that he will trust someone.
Indeed, the Master of Sodom proved to be a united, discreet, and discreet woman who was an example and an object of personal interest to the rest of the nation.
Still, until March, Mother Sadia had to pay off her debts, and she had to stop receiving government aid from the government on her own.

There is a threat to the United States of America to the Dakile COVID-19 River - Leader Hausa Newspapers.
In recent times, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), has expressed concern over the steps taken by some of the poor, and has preserved the COVID-19 respiratory virus, which is expected to be on the rise, where it has been said, that the superiority of the different species must be avoided, while the plague has been severed.
And it should be properly divided into two categories: the world’s health system, which is ideal for many, and the world’s economic and social well - being.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians have been pursuing the goal of showing superiority over their own interests, of dividing the risk of infection, and of disrupting land - to - land cooperation in the face of wars and epidemics.
In the current trend, 23 million people have already been diagnosed with COVID 19 in the world field.
In that number, more than 800,000 people died from the disease.
Under such adverse conditions, the influence of the virus’s immune system is being further highlighted, and the joy is, in recent times, a major result of the study of the virus has been seen in some of the factors, such as the skin, and the belief in the take-up of human species throughout the world.
The sad reality, though, is that some U.S. politicians have shown a desire to steal the money.
Even Science has shown that the U.S. government has already ratified the COVID-19 passport agreements with a value of more than $6 billion from its various pharmaceutical companies.
Although the goal of the U.S. government is understood as being at the forefront of the disease, other developing minorities also need a cure, since they are more likely to suffer from the loss of health benefits.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also pointed out that, if the United States achieves the goal of ridding itself of the trigger device, the number of the device at the top of the rising ladder will be reduced.
He was a prominent member of the Central African Disease Center, CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, who was also concerned about this subject.
As some commentators on everyday matters, even if the plague has been won, it is impossible to achieve the goal of seeing it after the disease, unless it is planned to divide it, which is an important issue to the ground and the ground.
And it is appropriate for all parts of the earth to strengthen their bond of unity.
The World Health Organization’s major authority, the World Health Organization, has suggested that, if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be taken into account in every aspect of the world’s population, and some parts of the world — or even a few — of them — are unlikely to achieve the goal of aiding against the effects of the epidemic.
