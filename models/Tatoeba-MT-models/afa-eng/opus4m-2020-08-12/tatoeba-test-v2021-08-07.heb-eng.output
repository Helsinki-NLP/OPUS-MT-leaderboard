I see where it's headed.
I see you made a good impression.
I'm taking an initiative and putting down the moment for my own good.
I rarely see him.
Speaking in English?
I sent you an e-mail.
Is everyone okay?
Is everything okay?
Is everything there?
I'll leave school.
I share his political views.
Is he interested in me or something?
Is he really coming?
Is his father a doctor?
I was shaking.
I need to come too.
I have to run.
I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
I shouldn't have asked Tom's hammer.
I should have stayed longer.
I pulled my shoulder.
I'm Sarah.
It's five hours now!
Does it have any use?
Is that serious?

Is that far?
Is it far from here?
Hard to learn Greek?
Is it possible that I even have a chance with Tom?
Can I get there on the walk?
It's raining?
Is that red?
Is it safe to drink who's flashing in here?
Is it safe to eat it?
Is it true that Tom thinks I believe that?
Is that true?
I missed one line of reading.
I slept yesterday all day, because it was Sunday.
I slept late.
My hat's straight?
I'm sneezing all the time.
I sneered.
Isn't it flat?
Isn't life wonderful?
Isn't that theirs?
I'm exaggerating sometimes.
Sometimes I hurt my stomach.
Sometimes I use scissors to open boxes.
I kind of understand.
I so want to take you with me on Saturday to the sea.

I'm staying home on Sundays.
I stayed calm.
I stayed home all day and read books.
I stayed awake all night.
Will tens of thousands of yen be enough?
I carefully pressed the fuel tank.
Is this a hidden threat?
Is this music coming to West And?
Is that what happened to her?
Is that what the government wants?
Is that what you came to ask me for?
Is that your sister?

It's not my decision yet.
You're still missing me.
I still think Tom's gonna win.
I still think Tom's hiding something.
Tom's armed?
Tom's acting right?
Tom's a warrior?
Tom hungry?
Did Tom share that?

Tom in the emesis?
I've learned very hard.
I suggest you send him a letter of thanks.
I suggest you put the weapon down.
I guess I'll have to be more careful in the future.
I guess that's it.
I really pushed your snuck in the shit.
I suspected so.
I suspect Tom doesn't make his own homework.
I guess Tom already knows that.
I guess you won't like it.
I suspect they're heating up the beer in that spa.
I'm an I.D.
Is your house far from your company?
Your mom's home?
Is your new computer working well?
Is your room cold?
Is your room cold?
Is your wife still in the United States?
Every night I do a bath.
I repeat it.
I'm removing my hats from his hard work.
I talked to everyone.
Looks like he's wrong.
It's probably a wedding.
I tasted the wine.
It's become too much.
It bothers me.
It could be deadly.
It's a future to be a woman of destiny.
He can't be busy.
This could get anywhere.
This could happen.
It scares me right.
That must have made a good feeling.
It depends on how you're messing with it.
Depends on the context.
It's not longer than three minutes.
It didn't matter to me.
It didn't even matter to me.
It didn't go that far.
It's not longer than three minutes.
It took some time to get used to it.
It won't bother us if you take a picture from the outside.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
You don't pay for playing video games.
It doesn't sound like you want me to help.
Doesn't seem to matter.
That doesn't sound like her.
It takes a long time.
That really sounds like a magician.
I teach Dutch.
I tend to agree with you.
It feels great.
That feels right.
That's so good.
There's a lot of loneliness here.
I thanked him for his advice.
