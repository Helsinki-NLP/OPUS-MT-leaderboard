Parliament's friends in Wales are afraid to look like dolls.
Some members of Parliament were shocked by the proposal that the title of their role change from AMs to MWPs.
This fear has been raised following plans to change the name of the court to the Wellsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament are concerned that this is going to be a joke.
One member of Parliament of the Laver Party said that his men were afraid that "it's going to creep with Twp and Pwp."
For a name outside Wales: in Walsh, twp means stupid and pwp means cucky.
A member of the Parliament of the Pygmary Party said that all his friends were "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Walsish Guard Party said that his friends were "opening up to offer" about the change of name, but stated that the name MWP (Prime of the Walsey Parliamentman) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the waltz letter is similar to the expression of the letter and in English in Yekshier.
The House of Inquiry Committee, which is currently reviewing the drafting of the names, said: "The final decision on any words described in terms of the names of the members of the jury is, of course, the decision of the drafters themselves."
The Wills Government Act of 2017 granted the House of Jurists the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, whereby broad support was given to the change of the name of the Parliament of the Parliament of the Walsey (Welsh Parliament).
As for the title of Parliament's membership (AMs), the committee recommended the members of the Walsey Parliament or the main WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in public consultation.
Parliament's members offer alternative options, but the struggle to get a consensus may cause a little bit of headache to the chairman of the committee, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to submit an antique theory about the changes in the next few weeks.
The investigation into the formulas of other changes in the working form of the law enforcement office, including the removal of members of the parliament and the building of the committee system.
The vote of the members of the Parliament is that you will eventually establish their title of office during the hearings.
Macdonia's citizens are going to the cards at the table with a change in the name of the country.
The citizens will vote on Sunday on the question whether to change their country's name to: "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's request was made in an attempt to resolve a ten-year dispute with neighboring Greece, where a province called Macedonia existed.
Greece claimed for a long time that the name of her neighbor was a fence that claimed for Greece's territory and returned and opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and the North.
President McDoniah, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about the change of name, said he would ignore his findings.
However, whoever supports the people's wish, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claims that the change of name is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and the United States.
The bells of St. Martin's church are still present in the difficulty of the churches in Harlem.
According to Mr. Adams, "the old neighborhood's people have a number that used to be a bar and a church in every corner."
"There are no bars and no churches."
He says it's possible to understand the disappearance of barons.
The lives of people today are different, mentioned.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood hall where people visit on a permanent basis.
As for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last for as long as church leaders expect, sooner or later, to find themselves again at the beginning.
According to the churches, housing buildings will be taken with shared homes that feed people who are not of the kind to help the neighborhood maintain a unique character.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white people," he says, "so this will undermine the closure of these churches, because most of those who move to these homes are unlikely to join these churches."
Both churches were built by faith communities to build, before Harlem became the most black neighborhood - the Communist Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Buddhist community left in the 30s of the last century.
A black community that operated in the area became the owners of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was moved by a black community of believers under Father John Howard Johnson, who led a business on 125th Street, a central shopping block in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance black.
Burns in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but as part of the program of believers under Pastor Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the bell radiation.
Priest David Johnson's son Johnson the father and who inherited his place at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the "Bourbons of the Poor".
The expert who played the July Cream called it "cultural treasure" and "historic instruments that have no replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ining, University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first detonator to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who will continue to play the largest radiation at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marihua R said that St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the last few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought up by local church leaders and others by the episcopic espousing.
The meeting, which is the governing body of a community of believers made up of local believers, wrote to the bishops in July a letter explaining her fear that the bishops would try to roll the costs to the meeting, although the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishops.
Some believers complained about the lack of attitude on the part of the bishops.
A 13-year-old wound shark in the shadow to catch the Lobsters
An attack shark and injured a 13-year-old on Saturday while the boy was shadowing to catch Lobsters in California on the first day of the Lobster season, thus delivering official causes.
The attack took place a little before 7:00 a.m. near the Bay of Bec√≥n in Incentas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he had taken with friends from this one o'clock in the morning, when he heard the boy cry out for help and then found out there with a team to help bring him to the beach.
Hammel first thought of a question just how excited he was at the Lobster's trap, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I'm biting!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that as he approached the boy, he saw that "every bone of his runaway was taken away."
"I yelled everyone out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy's got hits at the Radi hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as a human being.
It's not known which shark species attacked the boy.
The chief of rescue Larry Giles said in a press briefing that shark was identified in a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it wasn't a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim had been traumatized in the upper body area.
The authorities closed access to the beach between the Ponto Coast in Cascad and the Suami Coast in Asynitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles stated that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sansbury's starts a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens up his dog shop style with professional sales women.
As part of a significant initiative to enter the British market for beauty products of 2.8 billion Sterlings a year, and as it continues to grow as sales in fashion fields and household products decline, the wide range of beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, additional stores will be added next year.
Investing in beauty products comes at a time when you can find ways to use a shelf area that has previously been captured by televisions, microgelves and household products.
Sansbury's stated that the company is expected to double its product of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tewezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oreal companies, Mybelline and the Burt's Bees will also win an additional area with target branding areas such as Bots.
The coral network also rewires its botique product line - so that most products will be friendly to natures, a feature that he wants to grow in the midst of young buyers.
In addition, France Shop's heaven store network will check the wins at two Sansbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croyden, south London, last week and the second will be opened in Sly Oak, Bermingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and beyond the purchase of smaller quantities of food every day in local comfort stores is required to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO Sunsbury's, said the branches would become more gay to their dog shop while the coral network was trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl's cheap networks with more services and non-food products.
Sansbury's added sales points of Argos in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Beitat points since she bought the two networks two years ago, increased the sales of the store products and made the purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive the products of beauty and her pharmacys ended up in failure.
Sansbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the communications ended after a disagreement how to distribute profits from the industry's chambers into the harbors.
The new strategy comes after Sansbury's sold the business activity of the industry in 281 ncs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds network for 125 million trilings three years ago.
According to Lloyds would play a role in the program, by expanding the brand performance of expensive products for skin development, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, at four stores.
Sansbury's commercial manager, Paul Mills Hicks, said: "We've made a reverse in the appearance and sense of our beauty products, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we invested ourselves with those who were especially trained and offered advice at the place.
Our brand performance is designed to fit all the needs and the attractive environment and our comfortable locations make us an active goal to acquire good products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones was angry after Holly Willavi canceled a deal worth 11 million trolling.
The TV Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed anger after the TV service Holly Wilavi canceled an 11 million trolling deal with his life-style to focus on her new contracts with Marx And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willavi doesn't have time for the brand of their household clothes and aliens.
The mutual business of the two is like the Goop of Player Gwynth Paltero.
The 37-year-old Thiis Morning program served to announce her departure in Post in Astgram.
Holly Willavi left the Star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones in anger at the recent cancellation of her participation in the quality of life of the two - to focus on her fat contracts with Marx And Spencer and with ITV.
Sources have reported that "Funs responded" when the TV star announced during a storm meeting on a Tuesday meeting in the main offices of his business empire in Marlow, Bakinghashier, which was due to her new business - in up to 1.5 trunchets - did not have enough time to devote to their household clothes and empires.
The joint business of the two was like the Goop of actor Gwynth Paltero and was expected to double Willavi's loan, which was taught in 11 million Sterlings.
At the time that 37-year-old Willaby was advertising in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his resorting homes.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly the top priority of Holly's order.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income for the next few decades.
It's decided to leave all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the drink.
The company warehouses in Marlow are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of Theis Morning, which is one of the most prosperous stars in Britain, may result from the huge investments in various products, from mines and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delay in delivery.
And it could bring to the end of long friendships.
Willavi, which is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, in ten years.
Willaby set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Hans joined as president of the Society in March.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones is the owner of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Wilavi will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Annette McPretlyn as an access to I'm A Celibrity ITV program.
A close source to Jones said last night: "We're not responding to his business business."
‚ô™ And then we fell in love ‚ô™
He made fun of her criticism. He won on the news press for statements that some are defined as "non-Presidential" and that he's so positive about North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Said Trump in the voice of "new server."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after he praised their first meeting in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiation of nuclear weapons is freezing.
More than three months after the June summit meeting in Singapore, the senior diplomat from North Korea, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea didn't see a "welcome response" from the United States to the initial arms embargoes made by North Korea.
Instead, according to him, the U.S. continues with sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Tramp took a much more optimistic view of his speech in custody.
"We're in great shape with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim brought positive results -- halting missile tests, assisting with the release of prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he protected his extraordinary approach to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be President, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this full stadium, we've had about 200 people standing there," Tramp said when he pointed right before him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people
After the Lumbock earthquake, for example, it was told non-government foreign organizations that they didn't need their help.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population lost their homes, no national disaster has been announced, which is a condition for the deployment of international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit of a challenge, said Mrs. Sombong.
Although Save the Children is making a team to travel to Palau, it is not yet clear if foreign messengers can travel through the field.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesperson of the Agency for National Disasters, said that Indonesia's authorities are working to assess the situation in Palau to see if more international services contribute to the relief effort.
In the light of the earthquake in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not ready enough for natural disasters.
While tsunamis were built in the province of Achea, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of warnings of tsunamis in Palau, although there is a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best times, the trip between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship in Luxembourg to treat earthquakes makes its way to Palau, but it'll take at least three days to get to the new disaster zone.
The evil structural improvement of Indonesia is at the center of President Wucco Vidado's election campaign, and he has invested a lot of money on roads and train tracks.
But Mr. Wucco was present with funding deficits for his re-selection next year.
Mr. G. Wuko also experienced pressure from ongoing class pressures in Indonesia as a result of the religious gravitational process of most Muslims in the country.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have lost their homes in battle between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets - using knives, knives, arrows and other household weapons.
Daniel Stradge from the Liverpool Group is equal to the last minute in front of Chelsea.
Daniel Stridge saved Librepol from losing Lesie in Parmire Lig with a gate on Saturday at Oxford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a delivery from Madden Shakiri when he was about 30 feet from the gate of Cece and his group at 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left, and then he turned around a kick to the farororway.
The ball flew high above the width and landed to the top right corner of the network.
Eventually, the ball landed above the gate of Capa Arisbelga that snuck into it, and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and players like Shack always play as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as long as possible," Sodberg told her to locate LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanta and I did one touch and I didn't think about it too much and just kicked."
Chelsea led 0-1 in half after the Belgian star Adhan Zaar had a gate in the 25th minute.
The "Blue" candidate transferred back to Mamu Kobachech in the same game, before he turned around the middle of the field and ran fast into the half-field of Liverpool.
Kobach made a quick-to-go exercise in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful outside kick, which led the loser into the breadth.
The former emperor ran the defense and finished with the ball inside the top right corner of the gate, with a left kick that passed the Liverpool Allison on cattle.
Libpol will face Naples at the house stage of the Festival League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's gonna face a video-based U.S. League of Europeans on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
How did the deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia go up to 8.32?
How did the deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia hit 832, so the State's disaster agency announced on Sunday morning.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the destruction of the buildings that collapsed in the earthquake of 7.5 on Friday and caused the waves to reach a height of up to six feet [6 m], said the speaker of the agency Sotopo Furo Naru at a press conference.
The city of Palo, in which more than 380,000 residents, was destroyed by the destruction of buildings that collapsed.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police opened up a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Biccand this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John's Street as a dead body, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police call out to people from the area they saw or heard something coming to her.
Inspector Brian O'Ghan says, "The investigation is at first, but I would like to suggest to everyone who was near John Birkend and who saw or heard something suspicious, to turn to us.
I would also like to ask every person, especially cab drivers, who may have filmed something in a car camera, to approach us -- since the photos may include information vital to our investigation."
Police spokesperson confirmed that the woman who was in the body lived in Birkend and that she was in a structure.
This afternoon, friends who think they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was this morning.
The investigation continues while the police have announced that they are now in the process of sending messages to relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson may have just tried to get into his apartment, but he was told that the police had to force anyone into or out of the building.
He was shocked when she found out what happened.
The residents are now told they'll have more hours to get back to their homes.
A cop sounds like telling one person that the whole area is now considered to be a crime scene.
A woman looked at the scene when she was crying.
She comes back and complains, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., we'll be expecting two trucks of the police inside the scene and another one outside her.
A number of cops were in the scene when they were targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact Crimestopers on the phone 0800 555 111 and indicate the 247 calendar from September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue became the next target of memory attacks in the struggle around history.
The relief of the image will be a patty justice in light of the Telegraph that his Puritan supporters have performed so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But in the Cromwell Union, Mr. Creek's proposal is "stupid" and "smoothing to write history".
John Goldsam, chairman of the Cromwell Union, said, "I will not avoid it if the current dispute about the removal of statues, the image of Oliver Cromwell, located outside the Westminster palace, becomes the target.
The plague of civil wars in England was not done at Cromwell's order, nor was it done at his hand.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors on the Thomas Cromwell scale in the century ago.
The profile of Cromwell in the hands of Sir William Hammo Thornycroft, is a testimony to the view of 19th century and part of the history of many believed that they still deserve to be honored.
Mr. Goldsamm said to the Sandi Telegraph newspaper: "Cromwell was caught by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, by the person who defended the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the king.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is a matter of continuing historical controversy.
The fact that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation further, and Cromwell is one identified character representing one side of the desert at the same time.
His achievements as Lord the Protector are also worthy of honor and victory.
A deadly pig to drive a Chinese farmer to death
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer's death in a market in south-west China.
The man, who was identified by his family, was found dead with a broken ankle when he was covered in blood next to the pig's shed in the Blupnoi market in Guijuoo County, so the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject swine vaccines on May 30, 2005 at Chinghai County, China.
According to the reports, he traveled on a Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yonan County to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found out that a door to an open pighouse was open.
He said the tenant found a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 50 pounds attacked the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were full of blood and blood," said the cousin whose family was named "W," as quoted in the Guiang Evening News.
In a security camera, Yuan appeared to go into the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and escaped to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police collected evidence in the scene.
He was sent to negotiate a dispute between Juan‚Äôs family and the market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, it has been reported in the past that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused human injury.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 200 pounds [300 kg] a farmer's bracelet in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife took the animal away.
After an organic farmer was hit by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Toba told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood could be "trigger".
'They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very researcher... They're not gonna hurt you.
Just need to give them the appropriate degree of respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rain in large areas in the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakened while moving over the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa storm will bring raindrops all over northern Mexico and south-west of the United States over the next few days.
The winds of the Rosa storm reached a speed of 135 miles per hour, which means a 1st degree hurricane of hurricane, and it's right on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. according to the east coast clock, the storm is found to be 620 km south-east of the Ponta Yujnea, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it starts to create a Pacific over the Pacific Ocean that moves east toward the east coast of the United States, with a rosa approach to the half of the island in California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and it will start pushing deep tropical rain north into the south of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeter of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, a tropical crop that will fit in with the approaching growth will produce heavy storms in vast areas in the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimetres of rain will cause effluent and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical acid will cause the quantities of rain to reach 50 to 75 millimeter per hour at different points, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains of 50 to 100 millimeter are expected in parts of the south-west of the United States, especially in Arizona.
We may be overwhelmed with conditions that are rapidly deteriorating as a result of the spread of the tropical rain.
It is strongly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is danger of a tropical rain.
A heavy rain may turn can turn canyons into wild rivers and hurricanes will bring powerful winds and dust storms.
The nearest producer will bring local storms to parts of the southern coast of California.
We could have a total storm of over 13 millimeter, which could cause waste and parts of roads.
It'll be the first rain in this rainy season area.
Pulse tropical rainwaters will start approaching Arizona on Sunday and morning Monday, and the rain will be strengthened and spread on Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes all over the United States, while the Arctic area cools but the tropical area remains quite warm.
This situation often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the United States.
There's a 10-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and her mother, Nebraska and St. Louis to da Moine, Iva.
In the next few days, long-lasting Kitchie fever will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October the temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, moving from 27-31 degrees south to north-east.
New York City temperature can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecast shows high chances of higher temperatures than the average in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching Bert Quanano's hearing.
Over 20 million people were watching on Thursday, six TV networks, with the applicant's fascinating testimony to the Supreme Court, Bert Quanano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the '80s of the last century.
In the meantime, the political debate continued, with news flashing in the middle of the regular broadcasts to announce a sudden development on Friday: an agreement that was proposed by Senator Marisona G. F. Flyke, under which the FBI will conduct a week-old investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Saint's Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Quanano was wearing her body drunk and tried to spread it during a high school party.
Quanano, with mixed testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers is likely to have been higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers according to the Nielsen scale.
Nilssen examined the average view on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually difficult to measure people who watch the offices.
For comparison, it's a crowd watching a similar scale to that of the plyoph game in football or the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nilssen's data, Fox News Channel, France's enthusiastic support of Kawano's appointment, resulted in all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to the Nilsen report.
The level of interest remained high after hearing.
Senator Pleak was the central character of the drama that started on Friday.
After the High-level Attorney's office issued a announcement that he would vote for the benefit of the Kawano, he was photographed by CNN and CBS photographers when a group of protesters were shouting at him while he was trying to enter the elevator to get to hearing at the Legal Committee.
He's been in a low look for a few minutes while the prognosticators got him, when all of this is taken alive in CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
"You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flyke said that the office published a message and said, before the elevator door was closed, that he would say more at the hearing at the committee.
All the broadcasting and cable networks were broadcast in a few hours later, when the Legal Commission was about to point out that Qwano had to vote for the St.
But Flyke said he'd vote for appointment only on condition that you get an understanding from the FBI, he'd investigate the charges against the candidate for the next week, which my members of the Democratic Democrat minority asked for.
Flyke's partly convinced of the calls he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with a Congress and a number of Senators after that, Felix made his decision.
Flyke's decision had power, because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have most to confirm Quanano's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Quanano.
Chief of Government of Britain, Theresa May, accused a visitor of playing politics on Barkzit.
Prime Minister Theresa May blamed her leaders for leaving the European Union, who were playing politics with Britain's future and hit on the national Internet, in an interview to the Sunday Times newspaper.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Council of the Guard Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack her Berxite's Dumping Game, saying that the offer that Britain and the European Union would back up these things is "completely out of line".
The shot at Boy Simms: The police arrested Dyton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspect at the deadly shooting in Boy Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played in the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Dayton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for murder in the first degree, so was known by the Baton Rouge police.
Officials published a video of the conflict between Simms and Simpson, and according to the police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a WAFB network report, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, according to the police, he admitted to shooting Boyd to death.
The bail payments were set at $350,000, as reported in the Advocate.
The Pathological Institute of East Baton Rose published an initial report on Friday, according to which the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head and to the neck.
The police gave credit to the task force to catch escaped criminals at the Louisiana State Police Police Department, to the State Police Criminal Laboratory, to the Southern University Police and to civilians in the area that helped in the investigation that led to the suspect's arrest.
The director of athletics at the University of LSU, J.U. Aleva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for the "steering and upholding of justice".
Simms was 20.
Forward basketball, which was married to more than two feet high, grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of LSU.
His average previous season is 5.6 points and 2.6 rounds are coming back.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Weed, said the group was "shrewd" and "Blood" from Wade's death.
"That's what you're afraid of all the time," said Wade.
A volcano of ashes on Mexico City
An ash that was exploded quickly came to the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the inhabitants of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity of swallowing the male mountain and registered 183 gas and ashes in 24 hours.
In the center of Notro, there's a number of noises and horrors.
Photos on social networks showed layers of ash cover on the neighborhoods of cars in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geologists have noticed an increased activity in the volcano of 72 miles [45 km] south-east of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 took the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
A conflict between the police alone, the Catalonians, approaching the year's vote on independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the self-supporting protest against police forces, and thousands joined in protesting the first anniversary of the party's vote on Katalonia's independence.
A group of masked buckets that were caught up by the cops in the demonstration section, threw on the white cops and spread a paint powder to create black dust clouds on the streets, usually the water in the tourists.
Wars also occurred later that day when cops were forced to use idols to get over the demonstrators.
For a few hours, self-supporting groups have been singing "not forgotten, not forgiven" in front of those who call "Christian Spain".
In the local press, 14 people reported having received treatment for minor injuries suffered by the demonstrators.
The tensions remained high in the independence areas a year after the question of the people of October 1 was tried by the Spanish government, but we'll be celebrated by the foreigners of the independence.
The voters chose the majority of the votes to become an independent country, although the percentage of votes was low when those who opposed their dedication in most cases rejected the vote.
The authorities in Catalonia reported that almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote from being carried out in cards throughout the area in violent conflict.
The independent groups set up a night camp on Friday to prevent national police support.
The demonstration existed but had to be on a different path.
Therms, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the Gaul Check with his wife, said he lost hope about Catalonia's chance of gaining independence.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I've seen my parents crying for joy that they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catholic d√©mocratiques won an important victory, in the recent December election, they found it difficult to maintain momentum when many of their best - known leaders willingly or in prisons were waiting for trial for some of them in the people‚Äôs elections organization and the announcement of independence.
Juan Foyg, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded the police support in his phone device, said the conflict was mixed by politicians on both sides of the crisis.
"It's going crazy," he said.
On Saturday, Orowell Yonkers, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison waiting for trial since last year's elections to the European Parliament will be held next year.
‚ÄúStanding as a candidate for European elections is the best way to settle the debate on democratic values and the oppression that we have witnessed from the Spanish government, ‚Äù he says.
A few men were arrested after a car hit the house.
Three men - at 33, 34 and 39 years old - were arrested after a car hit several times in London.
The event took place in Blinggarg Kresant on Thursday about 19:30, according to British clock.
Detective Bob Belmings said we would cause damage to the gates and also to the building itself.
It may also be that at a certain point, an arrow was fired into the car.
Manga's kick gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rang'res.
Dolly Manga's first gate guaranteed the victory
Livingstone, who just went up to the league, surprised Rang'res and coach Steven J'Rard, who's only his second loss in 18 games as the director of the Eybroks Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved to a level with the hybrid in the second place.
J'Rar's team is left without a victory outside the high-season's house, and you'll face the leader Harts, who's behind her at eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rang're gonna host Rafed Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone extended the home missing sequence to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has already experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak host group.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they lay at a gate, when their directness caused crashes to various problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but dragged his experiments before a gate, and then Alan Llett could focus his efforts only on a long way after he slipped in to meet Craig Helgate's attack before the gate.
The hosts were willing to allow Rang're to play before them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host group to stay in free kicks.
And that was the way the decisive gate started.
Herrang Reese took a free kick and Livingstone created a opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in blocking Manga, who was hit and sheep from the center of the area.
At this point, the Rang're controlled by holding the ball, but they found that the protection of the house is incontrovertible, and the doorkeeper Liam Kelly is almost unattractive.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, although Alfredo Morlos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was robbed of Rang Ras Allan MacGregor and Gay touched a cross ball from another Lightstone free kick.
Cable bullets continued to enter Livingstone's breadth and collapse, while two punishing bullets -- after a hit on Glen Middleton's replacement, and one on hand-to-hand touch -- were removed.
‚ô™ Mlivingstone's abscess ‚ô™
Elsteer to Mont, BBC Scotland at Tony McKroni Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing result from Livingstone.
All the players were excellent, and they kept up the expectations of this wave up.
Their game style and the people of the players have almost never changed since they returned to the leading position, but they have to give a lot of credit to control the way he's restored the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holcatt was great, and led a superbly organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and J. and Warel high-directed all the way.
But the Rang Russ was uninspirable.
Even though they were pretty good sometimes under J'Rar, they didn't stand these standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened the home team's defense -- and this is a red shot to Rang'reres, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
welcome involved in Ardwan in Callen
There were blue smiles and sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Ardwan's controversial visit to Germany, whose purpose was to repair the relationship between the two member states in the United States.
They were at odds about such types of human rights, freedom of the press and the acceptance of Turkey for the European Union.
That's where Erdoan continued to join the opening of a new giant mosque.
Klen is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police declared security reasons for a public block of 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters stood by to see the president.
Hundreds of Ardoan opponents, many of whom were Kurds, also heard Colum, protesting that they were on Erdoan's policy lines and on Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposites reflect the controversy around the guest that some of the Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others defend him as a fan.

Lung Lartin Prison: six guards injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure prison for men, so delivered by the prison office.
The riot broke into Long Lartin's prison in Westshire on Sunday about 9:30 a.m. by British clock, and it's still going on.
Special officers from the Tornado Unit have been brought to a place to eliminate the riot, which includes eight prisoners and has been thrown into one wing.
Guards were treated instead because of minor injuries inside.
A speaker of the prison service said: ‚ÄúProtection guards are especially skilled to deal with an ongoing event in Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We don't get violent in our prisons, and we're clear that the mobs are sending the police and their prison periods may be extended."
Long Lartin Prison is home to 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison governor reported having been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the exhibits were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot when guards were attacked in the Snoker stick.
Roza's hurricane threatened with flashing in Pinks, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that a tropical storm hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen next week, when the remnants of the hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the south-east and lead to a threat to flashing.
National Air Service has already declared a danger to flashing in two and a third days for the west of Arizona into the south-east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Pinks, Plagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm Rosa is expected to walk directly over Pinks on Tuesday, approaching Monday with clouds.
National Air Service at Pinks published only "ten tropical Cyclones left in a tropical storm status or a tropical flood of 322 miles from Pinix since 1950!
Katarina (67) was a hurricane in hurricanes of hurricanes of about 40 miles [64 km] from Arizona."
The latest models of the Arizona hurricane center watch 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with up to 150 millimeter in Arizona's molybdenum.
Other areas in the South-West desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Egan, are expected to receive 25 to 50 millimeter, with a possibility of isolated places getting 50 millimeter.
To those outside the area of danger of the flash flood, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area suffered from a form.
Although burys are a serious danger, some of these storms will be helpful because the south-west region is currently suffering from a form condition.
According to U.S.-form surveillance, over 40% of Arizona is in a difficult shape, which is the second category in Hammer, so it reports a Web site.com.
First of all, a ruse of rosa storm will reach the land across the half of the island in California, Mexico.
Rosa storm, still at hurricane power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 miles per hour, is found 620 miles south of the Ponta Yujnea, Mexico, and a northerly slope of about 20 miles per hour.
The storm was hit by colder waters in the Pacific, and that's why you're weakened.
So she is expected to arrive in Mexico in the power of a tropical storm at noon or Monday's evening.
Raining across parts of Mexico can be heavy and can pose a threat to strong burials.
"A total of 75 to 150 millimetres of rain is expected from California to the north-west of Sonora, with up to 250 millimeter," reports a Web site.com.
Then a Rosa storm will continue into Mexico with a tropical money before you reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical summit, which will continue on Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger that is expected of a Rosa storm, or of its remains, is heavy storms in the south-west of California, south-west of Sonora, and south-east of the United States."
These raindrops are expected to cause evaporations in the desert and to cause life - threatening eruptions in the mountains.
Four were arrested for attempted murder.
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Sumarst.
The boy was injured in the Excelsior Tras area of Midsmer Norton on Sunday about 4:00 a.m. according to the British clock.
He's taken to the hospital, where he's left in a "stabilized" state.
A 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock, Avon, and Sumarst area.
The cops are asking anyone who may have a cell phone photo of what happened to get in touch with the police.
Trump said that Quananu suffered the condemnation and anger of the Democratic Party
"voting in favour of Judge Quanano is the vote to reject the rudeness of the spirit and the shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the Wiling arrest, West Virginia.
Trump said that the Democratic Party's "suffering the convictions, anger" throughout the process of his appointment.
Quanano testified to Congress on Thursday, denying violently and emotionally the guilt of Christine Blasie Ford that he had attacked her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her guilt.
The President said on Saturday that the U.S. residents saw the brilliantness and quality and courage of Quano that day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Quanano is the vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most outstanding legal minds of our time, a judge with an excellent past of public service," he told his public supporter in West Virginia.
The president was referring to Quanano's appointment when he spoke about the importance that the Republicans would have to vote in the middle of the priesthood.
‚Äú Five more weeks to one of the most important votes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
"So I run everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Tramp claimed that the Democrats were on mission to "oppose and interrupt".
A senior assistant to the Republican Party sent a message to CNN that the first major parliamentary vote in filling the Senate's appointment is expected to exist no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them were swept away by massive waves crashing on the coast, when a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Indonesia, so official sources were reported on Saturday.
Most people gathered for the festival on the beach in Palo on Friday, when a wave of about five feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, and drove many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
‚ÄúWhen the tsunami arose yesterday, people still dealt with their affairs on the beach and not immediately escaped, and they fell victim, ‚Äù said Sotopo Furo Norroo, the spokesperson of the BNPB disaster management agency, in an Akata briefing.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, wooden blocks, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Norruhu said, adding that the tsunami moved on the open sea 800 miles (497 miles an hour) before it hit the beach line.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people turned to 24 in Palau.
Air photos published by the disaster agency have shown a number of houses and shops, complex walls and colleges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
A year-old shocks kept shaking the beach town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The BPPT in Indonesia indicated that the energy released in the powerful earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the city's geography, which sits on the edge of a long, cold island, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Norroho described the destruction as a "large" and said Alfiys, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were trapped below the ruins of the buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Norruw said that the number of deaths and damage could be bigger along the north of Palau with a 100-mile beach line, a area called Dongla, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
The media "completely crashed and there's no information" from Mongolia, said Norroho.
"In the area, over 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that his men and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is now a tragedy, but the situation may get worse," he said.
On Saturday, she made a lot of criticism to the agency for not announcing that the tsunami had hit Palau, although official agents said that the waves had arrived while the warning was being issued.
In a video video that was launched on social networks, a man on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below him.
Within minutes of a wall of water crashing on the beach, carrying buildings and cars with him.
The Reuters message agency didn't immediately make sure the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused widespread power outlets that shut down the communications around Palau and forced authorities to match the rescue efforts.
The army started sending transport aircraft with assistance from Acarta and other caves, according to the authorities, but survivors still need desperate food and other essential supplies.
The airport of the city is only opened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Vuko Vedado was scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palau on Sunday.
How many of the deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia have flown to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision from Mongolia arrived in peace in the city of Palo, where shelter workers may have been trapped in the yards of their offices, they passed through sights of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dusva.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very difficult.
Even while relief teams began the sad activities of aiding disasters, it was our complaint that you avoided the presence of experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supply and people from other countries can only be started if the damaged area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a state-level disaster," said Olya Ariani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international aid, but this status has yet to be declared."
With the second night on Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family members of the missing people hope that their precious ones will be the miracles that shed light on the wonderful stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy's a spring shirt.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gandon Sovandono, the coach of Indonesia's Squads Continent Team, trained two missing landmen for Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel see him, and among them Mr. Mendji was his disciples.
"Elderly in the field of evaporation, I'm carrying my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how during the hours that news of the collapse of a hotel saw a widespread community in the area, he sent whatsApp messages to contestants in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray check, instead of the two blue marks.
"I think the meaning is that the messages have not been delivered," he said.

Raffer changed his name to Y.
The rapper bought and changed his name to Y.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The entity known as Kenya West."
And a 41-year-old sit called "Y" for a while and he used a term like his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes first to the show on the Stardy Night Live TV show, where he's expected to launch his new Yandah album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Granda who cancels her participation for "emergency reasons", said the plan maker.
In addition, it is a brief summary of his current professional name, and West said in the past that a word has religious significance for him.
I think 'y' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you', and St said earlier this year, when he talked about the name of Albumo with the Big Boy Radio.
‚ô™ So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's a Kaney, which means the only one, the only "Ye" -- just a reflection of the good of our son, the evil that we have, or the confusion, of everything.
The album is more reflection of who we are."
He's one of some famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Kombs was known as Paf Dady, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names "love" and "brother love".
Vest's ex-partner, J.Z., he also passed between versions of his name with and without a circle and licenses.
President of Mexico committed not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Anders Manuel Loops Oberdor, committed never to use military force against civilians, while the country is approaching 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
"Never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Military forces shot at a non-violence demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed about 300 people during the time left student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Loops Oberdor committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who learn and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into crime groups.
The U.S. has to double the funding of an artificial structure.
As China's activity in the field of artificial understanding increases, the U.S. needs to double the amount that it invests in research in the field, so the researcher who works in the field of artificial understanding Kai-poi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government published statements on artificial understanding, even at an hour when the U.S. government does not have a formal artificial construction strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it's meant to be number 1 in artificial construction by 2030.
"Latering the research budget in the field of artificial understanding will be a good start, given that all the rest of the countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial understanding," he told me.
The double funding could double the chances that the next major artificial achievement would be achieved in the United States, told me to the CNBC network in the interview this week.
Lee, who wrote "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was released in the month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcort, the director of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in the best-running mechanical intelligence company in China.
In the '80s of the last century at the University of Carnegie, he worked on an artificial understanding system that defeated his first-class refiller in the United States, and later served as a senior director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
I've been introduced to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and ask when it's gonna be next, to help identify the next vision.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
"It's not China that took us the lead researchers at the Academy, it's business companies doing this," he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial understanding.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
"I think we should automatically offer Green Card to the doctor in the field of artificial understanding," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council published its technical understanding plan for the next generation.
The National Institute of Natural Science grants funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the way the National Institute of Science and other government organizations from the U.S. Department of Rates for Researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, as I say.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint technical centre, which was designed for the evening of the partners from the industry and the Academy, and the White House declared the establishment of a special committee on artificial construction.
And the month announced a $2 billion investment in the field of artificial understanding under the name AI Next.
And as for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial understanding.
In the meantime, an anti-dumping initiative in the United States designed to create an artificial National Security Committee is not operational for months.
The Macedonians vote on the question with the question whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians vote on the question whether to change her name to North Macedonia's Republic, a ten-year-old dispute resolution step with Greece that prevented her from joining the European Union and the North.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is the land of Greece and Tatto for joining the U.S. and the European Union.
Both countries signed a deal in June on the basis of an average new name, but opposition to the humanist claims that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the Celtic population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the people's question and that a campaign of procrastination cast doubts as to whether the number of voters would stand at a minimum of 50% that would be required for the people to be attacked.
The question in the vote note is, "Are you in favor of joining the NATO and the European Union with the agreement with Greece?"
Whoever supports the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claims that this is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, which is one of the countries created by Yugoslavia's taxation, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera George Zebka, 79.
Although the people were not legally bound, enough members of Parliament said they would obey the results of the vote to make her the president.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The country's election committee said there were no irregularities right at 13:00.
However, the percentage of voters stood at only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, of which 66 per cent of the voters were voting.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Ms. Tennsky, voting in the capital.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zeev, his wife, and his son, Dushko, are applying their vote note in Stromiz, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, to the people's question about the change in the name of the country, which will open the door to her joining NATO and the European Union.
On the front of the Parliament's House in Squidia, and 54-year-old Delmir Cowderkov made a small broom and tents in front of the tents who had set up the people's wishes.
"We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join a straight head, not through the entry of servants," said Kavarderkov.
‚Äú We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zeev said that NATO companies would bring the most needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate was 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens support the European Union and the North," said Zerev after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be our "future security".
A poll published on Monday by McDoniah's Policy Research Institute showed that 30 to 43 percent of the voters would participate in the population's wish - less than the required percentage of participation.
Another wish, made by Telma TV, found out that 57 of the seats are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote.
For the people to succeed, the percentage of voters must be at least 50% and one more.
The wish's failure will be the first significant loss of the pro-Western government policy since she took power in May last year.
Aguro, driven through all of Britton's defenses to score a gate
Aguro and Sterling's rascals broke Britton's defense of the 2-0 victory of the Ster City on Saturday at the A.H.M.L.P.A. stadium in Strelling, England.
Looks like Agurro's closing the gate in a light bucket.
The Argentine pioneer got a delivery in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Bryton's defense players before he broke into the open field.
At this point Aguru found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on the Bryton border.
And then he kicked a left-hand drop and found Sterling.
The English candidate used his first touch across to hand the ball back to Aguaro, which at the right foot defeated Britton's doorkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a ball on the right side of the network.
"Aguraro suffers from foot-to-foot problems," said the director of a "Stere City" reporter.
"We agreed he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's a gate lamb at the same time."
But it was Sterling that gave the "heavenly Content" the advantage that began in the upper league contests.
This gate came in the second minute.
Aguaro got the ball deep in Britton's territory during this.
He sent a great outboard across the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana ran the ball before he led Sterling to the far-off course.
A blue player pushed the ball into the network right before he walked out of the field.
Manchester City will deal with fashionists at the champion party on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhine-Kar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler in front of the Rockis.
With the Nationales coming out of the Plyap competition, there was no good reason to push another start.
But sherzer, who acts very competitively, hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still consequences for the plioph for the Rockis, leading one game on Los Angeles Dodgers at the NL West League.
The Rockis saw for themselves at least an open card with a win of 5-2 on Friday night, but they still promised themselves the first place at home.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the second group will play the highest level, probably at any point I'll face you this year.
Why don't I want to handle this?"
The females have just announced the start of Sunday, but according to the reports, they tend to let the Sharer serve in such a situation.
Sharer, which will be his 34th start, a training value on Thursday and serve on his rest day - Sunday.

Trump exists. You stopped in West Virginia.
The president pointed to a situation surrounding his elected candidate to the Supreme Court of Bert Quanano, while he spoke of the importance that the Republicans would have to vote in the middle of the priesthood.
‚Äú Everything we did was right on our shoulders in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the most, most, I'm not dealing, but I'm actually dealing and that's why I run everywhere and fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible and terrible group of extremists, you see it right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power by any means required, you see the convictions, the waste.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to run to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
Democrats are, according to him, missions to "oppose and interrupt."
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, "and called the Democrats "wrath and evil and foolish and innocent."
He mentioned in her name the leader of the minority of the Senate, the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, who dragged a pile of public readings.
Do You Remember Her Answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I waited until--it was really a bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liver Party is no longer a pluristic place.
She's intolerant to those who express their thoughts
When my local party office movement activists voted for me, it wasn't a real surprise.
After all, I'm the last in the line of members of Parliament from Laibor who told them they weren't welcome - and only because we've got our mind.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was granted the same treatment because she was actively opposed to anti-attacks.
In my case, the decision to join me visited me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, for most of the irony, it is similar to those for which Jeremy did not agree with previous party leaders.
At the committee meeting of the East Nottingham Libert Party on Friday, it was said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and representative."
For most of my eight years as a member of a local parliament from the Laver Party, meetings of the General Committee on Friday nights were just like that.
As a matter of course today, many of the meetings and promises of "more kinder, more gentle" politics have been forgotten a long time ago, if anything has ever started.
It turns out, more and more, that the Laver Party has no tolerance for different views, and that every opinion is judged on the basis of being accepted for the party's leadership.
This situation began shortly after Remmy was elected to the party leader, when former colleagues thought we shared a similar political view, they began to expect him to make a petition and to take up positions that I would never have agreed with ‚Äî whether on national security or on one European market.
Every time I talk in public -- and it really doesn't matter what I'm saying -- it's immediately coming to the point that an abuse of social networks with a call for rejection, the recognition of central politics and reading that I don't need to be in the Liver Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more lucky than my colleagues, because the comments that are meant for me tend to be political.
I'm once more influenced by the professionalism and determination of the same colleagues who face every day in the face of a flood of racial abuse but never recover.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become the issue of war.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week on the Liverer Party to cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we've been in the same pluriastic place, and with every "untrust" decision or a change in choice in general, the party becomes more difficult.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to shut up, not be so cool and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Laver Party 32 years ago as a school student, I've been alarmed by the downfall of the Achts government that has almost caused my public school class to fall apart, and I've been looking for ways to fight better social services for those who need them ‚Äî whether as a member of a local council or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political views, including the last election.
No man in the East Nottingham could in any way confuse my political and controversial positions with the current leadership.
For those who advanced the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the state crawls towards Barkzit to hurt our families, businesses, and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Lord of Liver.
But in fact, the one message I have is not for the movement of my chosen Montgomery in Nottingham, but for the public, whether they are members of the Liveror Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of rejection or political benefits will deter me from acting in a way that I believe will serve the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from the East Nottingham.
Air 38 - 17 millerus:
The last two triads have reduced the final outcome, but there is no doubt that air is worth winning the wonderful and exciting game that is being done today at the Scottish High League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unconquered side of the 10th.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking risks much more, playing for the house team, and Coach Peter Morch had all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unconquered, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of the Melrose group said, "The air is coming to all credit, they've taken better risks than us."
The 14th minute of Grant Anderson, who was said by Fraser Climeau, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card of the team of Scotland Rory Hughes released to the game by Horiars, allowed Marcus to get points and John Bagot Trey's not a Homer.
Climeau raised Air's transport with a vice, before it was actually half, he was a lamb and then Mr. Tre Solo got 17-5 to the air in half.
But Melz opened the second half of Patrick Angerson's good and fresh, which was betted by the Goth, narrow the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of a severe wound of Rhondrich Kenout, taken from there in Alonca, and starting with the renewal of the game, Air increased the gap through the Trey of Staford McDwell, which was said by Climeau.
The captain of Air Blair McPerson was filled with a yellow card, and again from Rose used the other person with Trey who was not Bruce Colwin's Homer, ending a series of great pressure.
But the house team was restored, and when Strong Titchson got a yellow card on his cello attack without a bullet, the punishment post, from the Tatch lamb Caperson Down behind Air's advanced lead.
Climo Meir, as he did again from the return to the game, after Kyle Roy Ss kicked David Armstrong's box and sent the Greg Henry wing to the sixth of the house team.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurants
Star Still Game, Ford Kirnan, seems ready to move to the restaurant branch after it's found out that he's a director of a restaurant company in the license.
The 56-year-old player plays the role of J.K. Arvis in BBC's popular show, which he writes and he's back in bed with his old co-covenant, Greg Millie.
The team announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the program, and that Kernan would seem to be planning life after Krylling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adreftmore Limited.
The player refused to respond to the story, even though the source of the skotish San Remran hint was looking for ways to get into the prosperous restaurant business in Glazgo.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that doesn't find the sea hopes that the court will open a path to the Pacific.
Navigators at the Navy command are undercover in a few ships in La Paz.
Public buildings point a blue-sea flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the password: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
In all parts of Bolivia that cannot be found at sea, the memory of a beach line that has been lost for the benefit of a chila in bloody conflicts over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as is the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps in China for decades, while Bolivia waits for the International Court's decision on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and he of course looks forward to a positive attitude to come," said Roberto Calzilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will survive the International Court of Justice's ruling on major national agreements, hoping that the Hague Court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's ten-year demand for unfair calls, that Chile undertake to negotiate the grant of sovereign access to Bolivia's sea.
The President of Bolivia's Creedful Birth, Ooh Morales, who was confronted with a struggle to re-select next year -- has put a lot of decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But even if he decides for her, it doesn't matter much.
The United Nations court sitting in the Hague has no authority to grant Chila's territory, and it states that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the International Court's ruling came only six weeks after hearing the agreed arguments indicates that the case was "uncomplicated", but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert for international justice.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, even the last four years may have weakened them.
"The kind of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current government in Bolivia," said Zarata.
Morales' war architecture has eliminated all the rest of good will on the part of Chella, as it is.
Sometime Bolivia and Chila keep talking, but it's gonna be very hard to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not changed between them since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez and Shez, a representative of Bolivia Haug, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to open a new era in relation to Cheila and the possibility of ending 139 years of disputes for both sides, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales -- he's still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- is using the topic of the sea as a political propeller.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"Cessation is an opportunity to see that we have to get over the past."
North Korea says breaking off nuclear damage won't happen unless she can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ray Jong, said I'd never break the nuclear weapon first if she couldn't trust in Washington.
Ray said on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called the U.S. to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His words come at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompow, is on the threshold of a reopening of the diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after the summit in Singapore with a North Korean leader, Kim Jung On.
Ray said it's "a dream in Aspamia" to think that the U.S. sanctions and opposition to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to announce without North Korea first taking significant steps to dismantle a nuclear weapon.
They're Kim and they're President of the United States, Donald Trump, interested in the second level.
There is, however, widespread doubt that North Korea is serious about the waiver of its nuclear-weapon complex, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its safety.
Pompau plans to visit Pinging next month to make a second top between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris exposes the new tand in giant hats on his way to the expensive stores everywhere.
We'll find the solution for everyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get full protection from the sun.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown exposed a line of huge and crazy headcovers to their SS19 coalition, in a fashion show that set the style scene off in Paris.
Uninactive hats have conquered the summer Instagram, and these designers have brought their extraordinary works to the fashion display path.
Valentino's brilliant item was a large-colored cap with a wide-ranging pair of feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other espionage-sized explorers include espionage assurances, magic hats and even pineapple-- but they were not meant to protect their head from cold.
Tom Brown also exposed a strange mask - check time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks included sharper and more bleeding lips to Hutteril Lecter than to Hutter Cuttor.
One creature mentioned a sound mask including a castle and glasses, and another looked like a melting ice cream.
And those who want to go on with a huge fashion saying -- their time has come.
The fashionists observe that the giant hills make their way to the expensive shops everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bomba's, the two-metre, two-metre, two-footed cap on the head of everyone, beginning with Mariana and up to Emily Rataokowski.
Libel Calette behind the very unparticipative hat who drowned the social networks gave birth to another great creation on the track - a sea case that is almost as large as that of a model in the sea clothes that carried it.
The colouring case written in a burn, with a large refill and a white leather hand, was the prominent item in the SS19 collection of G.K.L.L.R.R.R.A.S.P.S.P.P.A.
"I watch big hats and big seabags coming to the expensive stores next summer, because design made a great impression and it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-size X-surise."
John Edward: Language skills essential to the world's citizens
The Independent Schools in Scotland keep a record of academic excellence, which was held in 2018 with a further set of extraordinary test results, which are reinforced by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), offer the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further education and education, a career in which they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an educational program capable of planning and pursuing a program of personal adaptation, we find that modern languages continue to be popular as desirable school subjects.
‚Äú Speaking to a man in a language he understands, ‚Äù said Nelson Mendella, ‚Äúit goes into his head.
Speaking to a man in his tongue, it came into his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Last year's test results show that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a high grade A.
Data collected from the 74 schools that members of the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a higher grade in Danish, as well as 72 per cent of those who learned German, 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Today, language as a matter of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Council found that the reasons why employers indicated to Cody that they would be able to perform available jobs would be 17 per cent less skilled in language.
As a result, language skills become more and more necessary in order to prepare students for future careers.
The upsurge in language requirements for future employment opportunities is vital in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of YouGov, which included more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language at a level that provided for the existence of a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a bibliography of 15 per cent of speakers.
That is why it is important to invest in teaching children language today.
Knowledge in many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different as to the languages they learn.
Some of the schools will be more focused on modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered best for Britain in front of the 20s of the 21st century, such as modern and Japanese.
No matter what the child's scope, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers who specialize in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an education environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, in any future.
There is no denying today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact has to come to my attention in education.
Indeed, there is a need to see in modern languages "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, Greece and excellence to the scotland children.
It's the time order.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council for independent schools.
Bron is expected to play for the first time in the Lakes on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who were waiting to see Baron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakeers group.
Coach Lakeers, Luke Walton, announced that James was going to play the pre-year game in front of Denver Nagges on Sunday in San Diego.
But we'll just set a few minutes before he'll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," written on Lakeers' official website.
He wrote Lakeers Mike Trudell published a tweeter likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakeers' pre-year games.
"At this point of my career, I don't need old-time games to get ready," he said.
Trump's arrest time to West Virgnia, Utib Channel
President Donald Trump opens up in the bathroom of tonight's elections at Willing, a virgic system.
This is the first of five planned camps of Trump this week, including stops in friendly places like tennis and Mississippi.
While you voted for his appointment to the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming middle-priest elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's arrest in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it on the Internet?
The arrest of Trump in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. by east coast watch on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can expect the arrest of Trump in West Virginia on the Internet at a direct stream in Youtiv.
It is likely that Trump will refer to the hearings that took place this week for High Court High Court Bert Quanano, and become expert on the charges of improper sexual conduct and thus the rejection of the vote in St.
But the main objective of this conference wash is to help the Republicans facing the November challenge to get some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's election headquarters said that the aim of these five camps next week is to ‚Äústir up volunteers and support while the Republican authorities try to protect and extend the majority of them in St. Petersburg and the House of Elections, according to Reuters.
Control in Congress is so critical to his Agda, until the President is ready to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the narrow election season, said to Walter that he spoke about the Trump campaign that he had asked to stay silent there.
The arrest tonight, which is planned to be at the Wesvenco stadium in Willing, can bring back support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw a press cover from the Pittsburgh press, to the West Virgilty Metro News assessment.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate for St. Virginia West, Patrick Morrisie, who's in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morice that the President should come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuter.
Ryder Cap 2018: The U.S. team shows the right to fight to keep hope for the single games on Sunday.
After three one-sided scans, the fourth game on Sunday afternoon are maybe exactly what the Ryder Cap needs.
The Momentum's driving glamorous idea is a completely invented sport, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we're gonna find the momentum now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now it's four, so you can see it's a bit of a monotonous," said Vern Spie at the end of a day.
Europe, of course, four points forward with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as I say, feel that they have a little wind on the ships, and they have a lot of encouragement, and not the last one in a symbiotic form, and the St. Thomas, who have played together all day and each one of them has three out of four points.
Semi was a killer of T to the green and he was a personal leader.
The noises of joy were stronger as his round lasted, when he swallowed a critical Pat to win the game four all-square and Thomas went down two after two.
His Pat that won the 15on game won a similar appeal, the kind that shows that he believes in the American team still has hope.
"You really need to dig deep and just worry about your own game," said Spie.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 tires to leave a seal.
The only players with more points from the top and Thomas over the last two days are Francisco Molyni and Tommy Flytwood, the story of the Ryder Cap.
The strange, but beautiful, Europe's band is four out of four and wins everyone's affection.
"Mulwood" was the only one who didn't hit the machine on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the videos on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back of Friday morning.
The same round, and the way in which their energy appears to flow to the enthusiastic audience and from him, is based on the fact that they are players who will win on Sunday, and will not be a more popular player than Flytwood or Molinary to sign the potential European victory with the sun going on Le golf National.
It's better both at the same time in different groups.
Yet, it's too early to talk about European glory.
Butterfly and Tsson Web Simpson ended up with Sarge Grisia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he robbed Alex Norne.
Faye and two times the front nine took down the Spaniards and the Swedens into the hole they didn't get out of.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the pit.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four bullets and fours because of the interactions between the sides, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change as much as an eye can.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has been significantly demonstrated for the last day, but this fourth shanch showed that the American team is full of a spirit of fighting that part, mainly within the United States, has questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cap
Europe is in a healthy mood for the last day of the Ryder Cap after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday in 10-6 against the United States.
The full of inspiration by Tommy Fletwood Wrensco Molinary led to the change with two wins on the fighting Tiger Woods, and raised the gap so far in the Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side players, who tried to protect the cup they lost in Hazellin two years ago, ruled in front of the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, and brought the series to 3-1.
The American players showed much more resistance to the fourth game, and two games were won, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep holding the hat, Jim Forek's friends need eight points from the 12 single games.
Flywood is the first European tortoise who won four points in a sequence, while he and Munyri, who won the term "Mulwood" after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second step that won four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cap.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they went on in the wonderful harmony together defeating the weakly American Woods and the Bryson Dachmboo rhyme with a further score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, showed random outbreaks of excellence, but so far he lost 19 out of 29 games of four and four, and seven games in a sequence.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the four-ball games of the morning, came back to join the Starson in the fourth game to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coca, who are first and third in the world.
However, not everything was easy for the Europeans to play in the cool weather and the cool spirit that settled in southwestern Paris.
The winner three times, Jordan Sif and St. Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-one win over John Ram Sperde and Ian Polter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Fletter and Rory McCliroy 4 and 3 in the 4th games, after losing the first two.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cap group returned from a negative four-point gap to the only games, although as holders of the cup, Purrick's men only need a bag to keep holding the hat.
However, after two days in the other place, it seems that an attack on Sunday is beyond their reach.
North Korea says that she's not gonna fall apart from one another without trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen her lack of confidence in the United States and that there is no chance that the State would give up its nuclear weapon unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ry Young Ho announced at the annual General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea took "significant good will" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the commitment not to develop any further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, we can't be sure about our national defence and under such conditions in any way and in any way we're not first unilaterally dismantled from nuclear weapons."
While Cheri returned to the well-known complaints of North Korea regarding the United States' opposition to nuclear production, that North Korea will be rewarded with taking steps, since his statement seems important that she did not reject the nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Rey referred to a joint announcement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the President of the United States of America and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed himself to act towards the "Nuclearing of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea asked for a formal end to the Korean War, which started in 1950-1953, but the United States said North Korea had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also opposed reading to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first nuclear denuclearization" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of aggression, and even resists `declaration of the end of the war', says Ri.
‚Äú The perception that sanctions can cause us to kneel is a dream of the assimilation of people who are lying about us.
But the problem is that the extreme sanctions deepen our lack of trust."
Ray never mentioned the plans for a second top between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States emphasized in his speech to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mon Jia-in in the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear phase was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear phase-out of the half Korean island wouldn't come to such a dead end."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, so he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that the U.S. land attack on North Korea's tablets is inevitable after the "President of Evil" Trump called Kim "rocket Man" in the suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, last year threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage in making steps to clear a weapon, but said there was still much more work to do and sanctions had to be kept in sight until North Korea's nuclear power.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a defined time frame, and added, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for the steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompoo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and without stopping until we get a full and true nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has supported one here in the lifting of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block the financing of its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Pompow met with Ri at the U.S. General Assembly and then said he'd be visiting Pinging again next month to make the next summit.
Pompow has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left A Pungang in July saying he had made progress, but a few hours later North Korea protected him for setting Gangster's requirements.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to break up a rocket site and a nuclear facility, if the United States takes appropriate steps.
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" in which he was interested included security guarantees for which he had committed a tram in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of the Washington relationship.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches the participants how to sleep more, in trying to fight in the expanding culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
A academic study found that university students in the world often have no idea about all the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleeping science at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at the Briggham And Weimns Hospital, who planned the course, that his assessment is the first type in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after the lecture on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
‚Äú At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said: ‚Äò Why do they just tell me this now, my last year of school? ‚Äô
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping-- what surprised me, he told the Telegraph newspaper.
The course, which was passed for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help the academic and athletic performances, as well as improve their overall status.
Paul chosen, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the University, said that the university decided to open the course after she found out that students had had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
An hour-long course includes a series of interactive missions.
One part shows a picture of a room in the dormitories, where students press coffees, villas, sports clothes and books - to get explanations on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are affected by a lack of sleep, as well as on the importance of sleep.
On the other hand, it tells participants how an ongoing lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students between night and night.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Sisler.
According to the culture of pride over successful sleepless nights, it still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students is causing the problem of sleeplessness to grow.
Sleep care provides, and good sleep quality, needs to be each student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because a lack of sleep makes the brain go hungry, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zisler design the course, after he attended one of his first studies in Harvard.
He said the course lifted his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all students to complete a similar program of instruction before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cizzel recommended to students that they check a clock when it comes to going to sleep, and not only for the hour when they need to wake up, but be cities for the harmful effects of a blue light that crosses electronics and the LED theory, which can break down the hierarchical rate and thus cause degradation problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ring Reese: a gate of a high-end Manga to Jared's players.
Herring'reres took another attack of losing the game except when Dolly Manga got Stephen J'Rard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingstone.
EBrux players were hoping to win their first game except since February 1-4 in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only lost the second of 18 games as director and left the team with eight points behind the Harts team in the top of the Scotch.
Manga attacked seven minutes before midnight, and it didn't seem like the uninspired Harang players would be worth it.
While the Ring're now falling to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third place and immediately after the Hebernian at the gate.
And he might be waiting for another Rang Dabel Reese after the Conone Calum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was probably thrown at him from the offer.
Jared valued eight replacements in the group that passed by Air to half the finals in the Betred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with the same 11 Livingstone players who took a point from Harts last week, and he could have been seven wishes from the way his players confused the opponents in any situation.
Herrang'res may have ruled the holding of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball he had.
They almost won the second minute when Manga sent a bullet to Scott Fatman who kicked into Alan McGregor's gate, but a middle-field player kicked the ball too far.
Then Kegan J. Cobb found Captain Craig Alcatt, but his protector Alan Latt could only kick out of the square.
Hering're yes, they took control, but there seemed to have been more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled for his own good after the fourth hour of the game, when he and Stephen Williams were attacked, but Judge Stephen T.
The Ring'res managed to kick only twice at the first half of the gate, but the E.B.L. is easy to break into Sana Culibali's attack and the weak kick of Obi Ajaria.
While the opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute was against the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they were entitled to at least for their hard work.
Again, the Ring Reese failed to deal with a deep loose ball of Jacobs.
Scott Artfield didn't respond at the time Declan Galger transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept him cool when he moved to manga for a simple ending.
Jared did a thing in half when he replaced Colebly with Ryan Kent, and the change came to effect almost immediately when the extreme/snap opened a bullet to Morlos, but Kelly's drawing ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to force the guest group to play exactly the kind of game he likes when Lila Goi and Lett keep sending long bullets.
Holt's team could have increased the transport at other stages, but MacGregor was well placed to prevent J.Y.C.'s experience before it was removed from the corner.
The Rang's replacement player, Reese Glen Middleton, had another claim to commit an offense against Jacobs, but Thomason ignored it again.
I don't know.
And now to stand by Sonday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continues... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Gary developed a method that enables him to identify and test radioactives, which eventually led to a device known as Mona Gyger.
Since the device became a science center, but in 1950 it also became a focal point in the pop culture because of the film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were shut down as two mornings/strength scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
"It's a Gyger monet, which is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your ears together, you can really hear the effects of radioactives on the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really broken up now!"
Hans went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
Immunization teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The system includes the extraction of vaccine cells from the patient, and the alteration of the cells in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" a protein that's shared with many types of cancer and then they're freaking back into the patient.
A vaccine shows promising results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who has been treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The system includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, the transformation of cells in the lab so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer, and then the throwing of cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Barzopsky, from the U.S. Institute of Cancer Baltsada, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "motivates the development of a number of types of cancers", including breast cancer, eyes, and ankles, explained Professor Barzopsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells has managed to treat the type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke out of a speech in support of Trump, with a MAGA hat in his head, after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't get into a nice eye.
Kenia West was read up in the studio during a mixed show on the Stradiy Nate Live program, when he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he was running for presidents in 2020.
After he performed his third song on the program, called "Guest Town", which was on the way to performing a Make America Great hat, he broke a statement of argument against the Democrats and returned to his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd be leaving America for a long time," he said.
SNL's chapter started with an organization on Matt Damon's march, where the Hollywood Star mocked Bert Quanano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Commission, on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blassie Ford.
Although the speech did not reveal the plan, the thing was raised to social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll West in the advertising of this thing.
In addition, West complained to the crowd that he had taken a review behind the scenes on the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out on the stage with this hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I'm in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Exminer.
West continued and said, "You want to see the dark place?" They said he was wearing my superman hat, because that means no one could tell me what to do.
Try showing love."
His words were read up to contempt at least twice on the part of the audience, and it seemed that members of the SNL team were embarrassed, Variety's report, and one of them said to the newspaper, "Thommy silence fell in all the studios."
West accompanied the program as a last minute in the place of the singer Aryana Grenada, who was a former partner, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Westm many when he did the song I love it when he was wearing a bottle as a Perier.
West won backup on the top of the TTPUSA, Kends Turner, who wrote: "To one of the most courageous souls: thank you for not surrendering to the crowd."
But the Executive of the Ectual Fund Center program wrote on Twitter West just "Be who he is and it's totally wonderful."
But I have chosen not to be rewarded (by his acquisition of music or his betrayal or his "art" support) for my efforts and the dissemination of ecology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we." She's added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he's "the entity that was once known as a West buyer".
He's not the first artist who changes his name and goes after Didy's, also known as Puff Didi, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Snoff Leon, and obviously the famous composer Prince changed his name to Sergeant and later to a artist who was known as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east in Belfast on Friday.
According to the police incident, Bilia was preserved.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Bellepest court on Monday.
The charges will be checked by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of the throne games, Keith Harrington, attacks the men of poison.
Kitt Reynton is known for the role of John Snows of the Swords of the Snap of the Vulnerable Marine fantasy.
But the 31-year-old player attacked the Straotype of the Mach, saying that such tasks on the screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough enough to honor them.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he thought 'something went wrong' and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisoning masculinity in the #Meto era.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he's very upset about treating this kind of thing.
"A man I feel very troubled right now - where were we wrong on the way about masculinity?" He said.
'What do we teach men in their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we now witness to?'
Keith thinks that TV may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic men, because of the very masculine characters it represents.
He continued: ‚ÄúWhat do we learn from the outside?
What do we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young kids feel that they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how does it change?
'Cause there's no doubt that something went wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any continuing series or a derived series of property games after the next summer, saying he was "ended with battle fields and horses."
Starting in November, Keith will be playing a new version of Sam Shepard's play, a real West, telling the story of a film producer and his brother the thief.
The player recently found out that he saw his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of the games.
"I knew my wife a series, so this series gave me my future family, and my life from then on," he said.
Rose illustrated the role of Yigrit, John Snow's love theme, the fantasy series wins the Emmy Prize.
The two of us were married in June 2018 at the Zasley family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has declared a 14% drain in a number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick, so they gave official health reasons.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected by the existence of sex, which is a change in comparison with the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood cities.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way reduced to almost zero, according to official health factors in China at the June district conference.
However, for a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of having sex is a burning problem in the US community in China.
Sexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but the invasion against U.S. people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infections of the disease are the result of a lack of use of adequate protection in these genders.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man from her team leaked information about a Republican Senator and protected the "Dangerous Lies" and "Conspiracy Theories"
American Senator Maxine Waters rejected on Saturday the charges that a member of her team published personal information about three American Senators on the Senate's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Senator from Los Angeles estimated that the allegations were spread by web sites and visitors to extreme right.
‚Äú Lies, lies, and other lies are detestable, ‚Äù says Waters in a tweeter announcement.
According to the reports, the information published included the residence addresses and telephone numbers of American Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of them slowed down.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown man on the Capitol Mount during the hearing before the Senate on charges of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court's candidate, Bert Quanano.
The leak took place some time after the three Senators asked Quanano.
Conservational sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was connected to Waters' office and published information on a member of Waters' team, according to a report of the Hill.
‚Äú This baseless charge is completely incorrect and a total lie, ‚Äù added Waters.
‚Äú My team member ‚Äî his identity and his personal privacy were exposed and our security was damaged as a result of these false accusations and errors ‚Äî there was no responsible way to leak this information.
This baseless guilt is completely wrong and a total lie."
Waters' announcements quickly launched an online review, including a former White House Secretary, Ari Fletcher.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fletcher.
‚Äú The point is that she does not have the status required of Congressmen.
When someone's charged with something he didn't do, he can't respond in anger.
He can't react in defeat.
He can't question the motives of the charges.
He has to be calm and calm."
It seemed that Fletcher compared Waters' response to the review of the Democrats of Judge Quano, who was accused of visiting people who seemed to be too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Umar Novaro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the middle of the priesthood, has also raised his thoughts on tweeter.
Big if it's the truth, he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that the office referred to the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement agents regarding these false claims.
"We'll make sure the offenders are discovered" is the continuation, and they'll be judged for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members."
"A review of the film "Johnnie Ingliche 3.0"
It is now acceptable to search for any new film about Burkezit with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate to this resurrection of the action-codice of the Johnny Inglesch series, which began there in 2003 with Johnny England and woke up to life in 2011 with Johnny England coming back.
Would an ironic self-strip on how much we are worth nothing become the opportunity of our country's new export?
In any case, Johnny Inglich, the cosmopolitan- eyed, and the rubber face got another chance to spoil things -- and his name represents more than all this broad-based community creation for film viewers in countries that don't speak English.
He's of course the stupid English agent, who, despite his strange face to the smooth glow, looks a little bit like Clozo, a little bit of a mister between and a lot of this guy who's contributed a little to the pleasure of the fire train in the opening text of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It's also based originally on the mysterious international passenger at Atkinson in the TV ads for Barclaycard, who's behind him.
There's one or two nice minutes in Johnny England's last edition.
I liked the thing where Johnny Ingliche's approaching the helicopter when he's wearing a middle-day armor and the pushing bells ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson shows his cosmic physical abilities, but Homer feels rather weak and too weird, especially since the "smart" type of spy movies is like 007 and an impossible mission themselves now includes a cosmic component.
The humor feels like he's addressing children instead of adults, and the crazy adventures of Johnny England are less brilliant and more focused on jokes than on Atkinson's whole film style in Mister Bin's image.
The film slide starts when a great danger threatens Britain.
Computers hacked into the British spy's super-secret Internet, and exposed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the anxiety of the main agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Aldon.
It's the last straw for a high-end, battle-like Prime Minister who's already suffered from the total breakdown of political loss: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Teresa May, but she doesn't have much to do with working on the script.
Her intelligence council informs her that since every active spy is exposed, she's gonna have to bring someone back from rehab.
And that means Johnny English Harberbani himself, who is now employed as head of a school in a prestigious institution, but gives non-formal lessons in how to be an undercover spy: a few good jokes here, when England offers a school-type spy Academy.
Inglich is brought back to Vitatol for an emergency briefing and is united with his ex-helper to the D.C. Buff, which is taken again by Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a battery commander, in the role of an annoying grade queen on whom Vico Pepprin is a little wasted.
So, in Betman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service conference, a terrible complexity comes back to action, when Pam Patal will be beautiful in the image of Opilla Bulta, which is from the Olga Corilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously sitting under the magic of a billionaire Christian technology who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer - the evil Jason Walta of Jake Lacey's age.
Ingliche and Buff begin at their Odyssa, which is more than a pair of clowns: under the cover of waiters, they're on the fire of a entertaining French restaurant; they're creating Anderlmusia when they run away from Walta's famous yacht; and inglich is a perfect anarchy in our attempt to use a typical reality kit to learn to know the inner structure of Walta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the last sequence, but in spite of the affection and generosity, it has a sense of child TV.
A pretty medium level.
And like the other Johnnie England movies, I couldn't help but think: could the British film industry not give Ron Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Liver Party denies that she's making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Liver Party is considering a vegetarian plan that the British will work four days a week -- but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to transfer the savings as a result of the AI revolution to the workers in the form of another rest day.
I mean, the workers will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits the company's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a worker's business.
Congress of Professional Unions supports a four-day job transition as a way employees can enjoy economic changes.
A leading source of the Liverer Party said to Sunday Times: ‚ÄúA policy test is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but this four-day work week is where it fits the party's access to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the employees, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Laver Party won't be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is currently not supported by the Liverer Party as an integral.
"A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party doesn't consider it."
The Laver candidate to the Treasury Minister, John McDonal, used the party conference last week to put his vision into a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "invisible managers" and "pricers" in service companies.
The plans of the candidate for the treasure minister also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Liberate government may make smaller ones on the basis of improper conduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to join employees to the board of directors of companies and to create mobile screenings in order to transfer 10% of the capital of companies in the private sector of employees, which will be put in a two-year, up to 500-year, dividends.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy said to the TV show "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation about Qana's change their mind.
The FBI investigation prevented the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and raised the question whether the investigation findings could convince the Republican authorities to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's Sunday's "60 minutes", Scott Fly wrote asking Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy was more open than his fellow to a party from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing, "I said I spoke to Judge Quanano.
I called him after it happened, the charge came up, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was decisive, determined, one-temple."
On the other hand, Graham's vote seems to have been taken by rock.
"I've already decided about Bert Quanano and there'll be a need for an exploding charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this:
And no man she mentioned could have confirmed that.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how something can change."
What is the world's citizen festival and did he contribute something to reducing poverty?
Saturday New York marks the World's Civil Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars that will appear and an impressive goal of an end to poverty in the world.
The World's Civil Festival, which exists this seventh time, will bring unto it tens of thousands of people who are going to a great forest in Central Park not only to enjoy such events as J.J.xon, Cardie B and Sean Mandes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event - to put an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The World's Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card for the event (unless you're willing to pay for the VIP card), on the island of the concert to complete a series of tasks, or "action" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help increase the awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful was the festival really, when only 12 more years before it was to achieve its purpose?
Is the idea of giving free concert tickets to people really a way to convince them to call for action, or is it another case of clictivism - people who feel like they really affect by signing a huge online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World's Citizens' Organization has reported more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, urging a variety of different goals.
According to these actions, world leaders have helped to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its action, at least $10 billion of which were already deployed or recruited.
The group estimates that the money budget has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, British partners of investors and employers who are committed ‚Äúto help children grow up full of their potential‚Äù, and promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to nutrition in the country, after having received more than 4,700 tweets from ‚Äúworld citizens‚Äù.
‚ÄúWith the support of the British government, donors, national governments and ‚Äòworld citizens‚Äô like you, we can turn social justice into a sub-food subject in history‚Äô, said the Embassy The Power of Nutrition Tracy Olman to the audience during the London Living concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called for Britain to improve its nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with an intervention in nutrition.
In response to one of their online questions, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world‚Äôs citizens have responded: ‚ÄúThis will be a long and difficult course -- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and opposition to Apartide, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
J'nett J'Xon, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B's and Janel Mona are among some of the events that took place at New York's New York's New Year's event, serving bee-le-fornes and Y'Keman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for the need to shut down the sea to delay the Russian export of energy -- the Minister of the Face.
‚ÄúIn need‚Äù, Washington could use the Navy to prevent the arrival of Russian energy to markets, including to the Middle East, discovered the American Secretary of Face Ryan Zinc, as quoted in Washington Exminer.
Zink claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria - which you have been made - is important to mention, at the invitation of the government - is an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to enter energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's Southern stomach," he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
‚ÄúThe United States, with our fleet, is able to make sure that the sea route is open and when it is necessary to impose a siege to make sure that their energy sources do not reach the market, ‚Äù he said.
Xinky addressed the audience at the conference of Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "colour of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to say that he compared Washington‚Äôs attitudes to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were indeed identical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, to a lesser or more degree, a leverage and exchange of fuel types", he said, with regard to Russia as "one trick's pony" because its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come when the Trump government went on a mission to increase its waste of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much smaller option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's government, and even the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to cancel its participation in the "undeserving" line project, which, according to Dramp, has turned Berlin into Moscow's "Water".
Moscow has often pointed out that the pipe line project has gone down in range 2, which has cost $11 billion and which is supposed to double the current pipe capacity to 110 billion square metres, is only an economic project.
The carmlin claims that Washington‚Äôs fierce opposition to the project is prevented but only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we're partners in the belief that energy can't be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position has won an anti-irradiation response from Germany, which reconfirms its commitment to the project.
BDI, the leading organization of the German Industry Department, called on the United States to stay away from the energy policy of the European Union and from the bi-party agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dietre Kempf, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German chancelloria Angel Markel and the Russian President and Dmither Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, you've been running for president in 2020.
The Senator from St. Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was "consider seriously" the possibility of running for presidents after the elections of the Middle Ages.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for presidents during a meeting in the City of Hollock in the West.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, so there's a need for a woman to stand in the head," she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the race for presidents."
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump during the city meeting, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried about my bone marrow about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren visited Trump on the appointment of Bert Quananu as a high court judge.
"Of course, we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on the ‚Äò Most of Warren‚Äôs choices showed that they do not think she should run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" voters in West said that the Senator should not run for election, according to a survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Spock and the Boston Global newspaper.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of dealing with the Senate's presidents.
The survey showed that there was much more support for the former Governor, Dabal Patrick, with 38% supporting his run against 48% opposed.
Superstitions from the fat democratic party have been linked to possible actions for the 2020 elections, including former Vice-President J. Beyden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Beidan said he'd make an official decision in January, according to A.P.A. Reports.
Sarah Flynn points to the traumatized post stress disorder of Trick Flynn at Donald Trump's arrest.
26-year-old Trik Failin was staying in Iraq for a year after his joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with the incident of family violence on the night of '
"What's going on with my son, what's going on since he's been back, allows me to identify with families that experience the consequences of PSD disorder and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning," she told the crowd participating in the arrest for Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Flynn called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other freed soldiers, "they return a little different, they return stiff, they come back and wonder if what they gave their country to the soldiers and the airmen, and all the other military people, is honored."
He was arrested on the ‚Äò City of Wesilla in Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, of reporting domestic violence and of holding a gun under rent, according to Dan Bennet, a Wsilla police spokesman.
18 countries and the state of Colombia support the reading of the challenge of the new state asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia support the reading of a legal challenge to the new US policies that refuse to provide refuge for fugitive victims in situations where gang or family violence is involved.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filled out a declaration of a court friend on a day and in Washington to support the reading of the challenge on asylum seekers' policies, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant's claim "Gryce v. Sschens", which was filed by the U.S. Association for Civil Rights in August, was not disclosed.
She said that a couple and his violent members, members of the gang, had abused her, but official factors in the U.S. government denied her request for refuge on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's State Parliaments described the states of Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, among which many requests for State refuge in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems with all groups and family violence.
The U.S. State Security Policy cancelled the 2014 decision of the BIA Council for immigration immigrants that allowed migrants without family violence status certificates to file a request for a state asylum.
The Attorney-General of Columbia County, Carl Reesen, stated in a statement on the day and ‚Äòthat the new states [are] ignoring decades of state law, federal and international laws.‚Äô
‚ÄúFederal law requires that all debates on requests for State asylum be based on the facts and special circumstances of the application, and that the new policy barrier violates this principle‚Äù, says a statement by a friend of the court.‚Äù
The lawyers also claimed that the policy, which prevents the entry of immigrants, harms the United States economy, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and "to provide a job that is needed," said the lawyers.
Attorney General Jeff Sashness ordered the immigration judges not to give more national refuge to the victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
‚ÄúThe State refuge is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social groups or political opinion, ‚Äù Sashness said in a policy announcement delivered on June 11.
The goal of the state asylum was never to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The rescue efforts are desperate in Palau, while the deaths are doubled, in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation has become more difficult than just a moment.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Rissa cosma, 35 years old, and if a baby is warm in the center of the rhino in the devastated city of Palo.
‚Äú The ambulance brings bodies at every moment.
Clean water is rare."
The residents seemed to be returning to their ruined homes, dissolving between water-spouse objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and in the hospitals, wounded by the earthquake of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwight Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder crises, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they received treatment for severe earthquakes that continued after the earthquake.
The tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt about the violent earthquake rocking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he had shared with his wife and daughter.
'There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," said Harris to the A.P. Agency, and added that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
‚Äú I heard my wife crying for help, and then she fell asleep.
I don't know what happened to her and my girl.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. ambassador blames China on "Britishes" with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad ad ad in American Yamun, promoting aggressive trade benefits between the United States and China, the Ambassador of the United States of America in China accused Big'ing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, on the last day of the Chinese press was added in payment, in Da Moin Reg., the best known newspaper in the state of Iva, after accusing China of an attempt to intervene in the American Congress on November 6, she claimed that China had rejected.
The charge that Tramp in China tried to interfere with the U.S. election, marked a new phase, according to official sources in the United States, on the Washington Summit trip to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to make known the promotion of trade, Big'ing Washington is now stuck in the war of the Goa War in which each country goes up and compares the customs rates on the imported products from its territory.
The tax reserves, which China has raised as a reward for the early stage of the Trade War, are designed to harm the citizens of countries such as Iwa who are supported by the Republican Party of Trump, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernstad, Ambassador of the United States of America in China, former governor of Iva for many years, and an important vegan of agricultural goods in China, said Big's hit employees, farmers and businesses in the Americas.
China, Bernstad wrote an article of opinion on the Day 1 of De Moyen Reg., "enhancing the acts of ironies by publishing publicity in our free press".
‚ÄúIn its propaganda, the Government of China uses the tradition of freedom of speech and the precious press of America, and publishes an awareness of payment in Da Wein Reg.
And against the press stand on Big'ing streets, you will find few opposing voices and will not see any real reflections that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic path, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that "one of China's prominent newspapers has avoided the proposal to publish," although he did not mention a newspaper.
The Republican Party keeps women's voices far away before the election of the middle of the cannibal with the Quanano incident, alerts analists.
While many of the leaders of the Republican party are standing by the High Court's High Court, Burt Quanano, protecting him from the number of charges of sexual assaults, analysts warned that they would see a response against, especially women, during the upcoming Middle Ages elections.
The feelings surrounding the matter were especially alive, and most of the Republicans have officially demonstrated their desire to advance the voting process.
‚ÄúThis kind of thing can't be brought back, ‚Äù said Grant Riher, a professor of state science at the University of Siricos School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Riher said he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator J.F. Pleak (the Republican Party in Arizona) to open the FBI investigation would suffice for angry voters.
‚ÄúPeople are not going to forget what happened yesterday‚Äîthey are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November‚Äù, said the day and ‚Äò Karin Z‚ÄôN-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speaker of the MoveOon movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.‚Äô
In the morning and ', protestors called 'Nobber coming' when we showed up in the Senate, when the ruling Republics of the Senate's Judicial Committee chose to continue to promote Quanano's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, according to a report of the Mic site.
"Democratic levels of enthusiasm and motivation will break new records," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
‚ô™ People say they were already high; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially in the midst of the voices of watching women in abundance and in the battle of young voters, between ages 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of affection for the President, often avoid voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which set out her allegations of the High Court's sexual assault, the analysts claimed that there would be a response against whether the Republicans would continue to promote their appointment.
"The appointment caused the Republicans a serious complexity," said Michael Steele, former National Republican Commission president, at the beginning of last week, reported the NBC news channel.
‚ÄúThis is not only by the voting of the committee or by the final vote or if Quanano receives the appointment, but also by the way the Republics handled it and the way they acted towards it‚Äù, pointed out to the news channel Guy Cecile, director of PRIORITYS USA, a team assisting in the selection of democratics.
However, the Americans seem to be very divided as to their degree of faith expressed in the testimony of Ford and Quanano, with a slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent survey of YouGov shows that 41% of the seats believed certain or likely to testify to Ford, while 35% said they believed certain or likely to be in Qanano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Quana was certainly or probably a lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
After pressure from FBI, the FBI is currently investigating the charges that were brought ford as well as the charges brought by one at least one complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian newspaper reports.
Ford testified in an oath to the Senate's Legal Committee last week that Qawanu attacked her for being drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed his own body to her during a party where they attended their studies at Yale University in the '80s.
Inventing the global global Internet network is planning to start a new Internet network to get over Google and Facebook.
Tim Brenners-Le, inventer of the global Internet network, from the Start-F project to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that will open Solid, the Brenners-Le Open code platform.
Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data and who are the people who are allowed to access the different types of data.
In an interview without the Fast Company, Bernards-Le made fun of the fact that behind Inrupt is "world control".
"We have to do it now," he said about the Start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app is used by Solid technology to allow people to create a "personal online data database" or a POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of activities to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drave, Microsoft O'Tulk, Sloak and Sputifay will be available all at once, at the same time.
What makes the personal database unique is that only the user will decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
It's called personal power by means of data.
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the Society, it means that the Inrupt will find the resources, the process and the right skills to assist in the formation of Solid for all.
Today, the company includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, the team includes a number of keys hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology keys from around the world can create espionage applications using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said that he and his team are not discussing Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusal to introduce a complete change, which will result in a complete shift of night and night in all their business models.
"We don't ask permission from them."
In a post published on the medium on Saturday, Bernard Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in solid.
In 1994, Bernards-Le changed the Internet when he set up the network's standard organization, W3C at the Institute of Technology of the West.
In the last few months, Bernards Lee had a voice that had an impact on the net's neutrality.
Even during Inrupt's silence, Bernards-Le will continue to be a foundation priest and director of the W3C organization, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm especially optimistic about the next day of the network," added Bernards-Le.
Bernard Van: An event that marked a man of religion who won the Victoria Crusade in World War I
The only man of the Church of England who won, fought, in Victoria during World War I, marked an event in his town 100 years after his victory.
Lieutenant-General Bernard Van won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918, for his participation in an attack on Bellenglisse and Lechacort.
However, he was killed by a rifle four days later and was never told that he had won the highest British virtue.
The victory stone was exposed by two of his allies, in a march at the head of the northern Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his colleagues, Michael Van, said that the display of the stone was exactly 100 after his grandfather had won the privilege is "an amazing symbol".
According to the London Gazate newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Alpha Van led his menace and crossed the San Canton Valley through a heavy fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and a gun.
Then he rushed the line of fire and the Great Lights led the line forward before we were quick to take over one hand on a machine gun and the elephant three from the fleet.
Deputy champion Van was killed by a German thief on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never compare to, but something that inspires humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a stranger after the march, which led to Brantwood's royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that he felt "highly honored to take part in the march" and added "the strength of a true hero is demonstrated in the support of many people."
The mixed combat artists stayed up all night to watch Balator 206, and instead they got Peppa Page.
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Baltor 206's action and finally watching the central event get rid of you.
The plan from San Contract included 13 battles, including six on the main card, and was shown live during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Jingard Mossassie and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in Britain remained shocked when the incident changed to Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after they remained up until the early morning hours in order to watch the battle.
One fan described the transition to the film of children as "some kind of sick joke."
"It's a government program that was set at 6:00 a.m. when the original content was not suitable, so they had to move to the children's plans," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of the Balator and media, when asked about the transmission.
"Pig Peggy, yeah."
President Balator, Scott Cocker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the repeat, I think we can probably solve it," said Cucker.
But it's 6: 00 a.m., and we can't solve the problem until day 1 in our time zone, that is on the day of their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, a lot of text messages were transmitted between sides and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical incident.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time this isn't gonna happen.
We're only gonna clean up five fights in six places -- as we usually do -- we've tried to give the fans more and just ordered.
It's a matter of unlucky."
Tom Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt comfortable 'cause of his sexual orientation
Tom Daily, the Olympic jumper to the water, said that while he was growing up, he felt inferior to all others because of his sexual inclination - but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jump said he didn't know until he got to the middle class that "not everyone like me."
In an interview given in the Desert Island Discs Plan of Radio Channel 4, at Lauren's Lvorn, he said that he expressed the issue of the rights of the homosexuals to give others ‚Äúhope‚Äù.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning Olympic games.
The regular host of the old plan, Christy Young, went on a sick leave for a few months.
In his appearance as the star of Lauren's first show, Daily said that he felt more "light" than the others when he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: ‚ÄúTo this day, you felt inferior, and you felt different, and there were real things that gave me strength and strength and enabled me to succeed.‚Äù
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out what his sexual inclination was.
The man who twice won the Olympic Ward Medal has become a strong leader of the U.S. Community campaign and used his participation in the British national team games in Australia this year to call other countries for legal status for gayism.
He pointed out that he felt fortunate to have the possibility of living in an open and without consequences and wanted to give others ‚Äúhope‚Äù.
The third winner of the World Games said that man-affectioning, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, suddenly caught me.
Daily married the Oscar winner, the oldest in 20 years, last year, but he said that the age gap was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age," he said, "he was involved in Olympic games for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June, a white man named Robert Ray Blackdale, and Daily said that his "all point of view" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it's all turned around, I'd have to win the gold medal," he said.
'You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer.
Daily said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games in London because he wanted to be first line.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be on the first line," he said.
‚Äú I held his hand while his breath stopped and only when he stopped breathing really and finally died knowing that he was not victorious, ‚Äù he said.
A year later, Dili started the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red Medal.
'I just knew I've dreamed of it for the rest of my life-- to hang in front of a crowd in the Olympic games, it wasn't a good feeling than this,' he said.
It's also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud of the St. Solomon - that you identified during the preparation for Olympic games and that still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC's 4 radio at 11:15, according to the British summer clock.
Michaelson was disappointed in the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golf player Phil michaelson will set a record on 1st when he plays the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to upgrade the performance so that the event doesn't turn out to be a miserable way.
Michaelson, who participated in the 12th anniversary of the New Year's event and determined to record, went down to the bench according to the decision of Jim Pyurik during the football games and the four Fourths of the two rounds on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as the leader of the games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Mayoor Tower, passed half the day as a cheerleader and half the other half at work on his game in the second in the hope of correcting the disease from which he suffered.
So, Michaelson, age 48, is not the ideal choice for La golf Nathanel, where the long grass tracks are not usually forgiven for the wrong bats.
And if the competition itself isn't shocking enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on 1st, won against the exact British champion, France sco Molinari, who cooperated with the starting player Tommy Flytwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the American ambition, which lost four points at the beginning of 12 single games, was to succeed in the early stages, the Michaelson game would have been decisive.
Pierrick expressed confidence in his player, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, leaned on my back, wrapped his arm around me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Pierrick.
‚Äú He has a lot of self - confidence.
He's a member of the glory hall and added a lot to these teams before, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it evolved and that's how we thought we should keep going.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on 1st.
That's how his career in the Ryder Cup might end, which never really match his personal record peaks.
Michaelson's right to 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven skirts, although Fiwerik said that his presence added certain unrealistic benefits to the team.
"He's funny, circusy, shawn, he likes to make fun of people, and he's good to be with him in the dressing room," he explained.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It's got a lot beyond the game itself."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could disappear soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day in the only games of the Ryder Cup might change for the worse.
The Danish player started his game in Valderama in 1997, when a couple of boys, Grandpa Bellestrus, had an advantage of five points over the Americans, who almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a small advantage and won 141/2-131.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in the Valderama; that we had a great advantage in the Brooklyn game, where we lost, and in the Valdarma, where we won but with a small advantage," said Bjorne, in the picture, after watching win 5-3, at the 2018 tortoire, they were the day and yesterday, which led to the 10-6 bla Cyannel golf.
"Then history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
We need to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on the track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the points don't appear on the board.
We have a purpose, trying to win the cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all the way, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy to play his players on the hard golf track and added: ‚ÄúI think I'm never going to get ahead of it all about golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and that's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as golf player is on the test.
And this is the message that should be delivered to the players: you should produce the best of your own tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind, and he's got to make the best of himself."
Contrary to Bjorn, the captain of the team, Sea Pierrick, would expect to perform better personals than his players, compared with their performances in the couple's games, except for Jordan Sif and Stan Thomas, who won three out of four.
Fiorik himself knows the winning side and the lost side, during the important concluding days of this kind, after he participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost, when the European team that won the victory course in the finish game, as set out in the "Miracle at Medinah".
'I remember every word,' he said in response to the question of how Ben Carncio, Captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to make it in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're preparing our vehicle in line with and up the guys to the track, according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas took the task of trying to lead the fight, and he'll face Rory McClarway in the top game, with Paul Cassie, Stine Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Paulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
'I chose this team of players because I think he'll be able to bring us to an end,' said Bjorn when he was dealing with his only choice.
Acceptance of Germany's new warship was refused again
Germany's new fleet was supposed to be admitted in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it was denied at least a year, due to the looser systems, the local media reported.
Rheinland-Pfalz's receipt, the ship leading on the new Baden-Wurttmberg-Class line, is now denied until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper's report, a de-scripted military speaker quoted.
The fishing vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but some worry after the supply closed the globe on the ambitious project.
All four Boden-Werttemberg-Class, which the Navy ordered further in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-Class.
They were expected to include powerful cannons, anti-board rockets and anti-ships, as well as smuggled technologies, such as acoustic signatures, low infra-reds and radars.
Other important features, including longer maintenance periods, could be released for the two years away from the house.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships - which are supposed to allow Germany to send overseas forces - will already become obsolete until the moment you enter the service, have indicated that there is some way out.
The F125 lucky Brigade came to terms last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Hospital in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy built a ship to build ships after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a critical number of "software and material" that made the warship useless for use in the battle mission.
The software was particularly important because Baden-Werttemberg-Class vessels would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half of the team used in the older Brigades, the Bremen Class.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has a dramatic surplus weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future degrees.
The weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is 7,000 tons, and it weighs two times the same type of ship that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the cleaning software, the cost tag of the project -- including the team training -- is also becoming a problem.
It was reported to be at a shocking height of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that impress the newest concerns are becoming especially evident in the light of recent warnings that Germany‚Äôs marine power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament's Security Committee, confirmed today, to the naval forces that are able to make a strike.
The official source says that the problem has gathered momentum and rise over time, because old ships have been removed from service but have not been replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret at the fact that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class Bridge could have been added to the Navy.
Scotland's National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted by the Institute in Harare Scotland seeks to reveal the way bats use the view to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will freshly enhance the behavior of the uniquely flying canaries and help guide future conservation activities.
The research that scientists in Scotland's National Institute will follow up on high-ranking bats and European bats, as well as the warm Doventon bats and long earballs in Enbrio, Western Russia.
Special recording devices will be located on key sites around the asset to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile scans through hand-to-hand detectors.
Internal sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of bat readings and who has the species responsible for them.
Next stage, a map of the areas of the animal will be encrypted to create a detailed picture of the size of the view, of their behaviour patterns.
Most mails, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS hope that the results will reveal which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of the living areas, such as the creation of his brother‚Äôs pillows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain were apparently small during the last century.
They are under threat of development and construction, affecting the cannon and the loss of areas of life.
Spirit therapy and light can also be a danger, and it is also true of the capture of flies and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
In fact, the bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting legs, bat ears are more useful than anything to catch prey.
They use sophisticated DNA tracking techniques to detect bugs and detect failures to their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the treatment of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important genes and 760,000 acres of land throughout the country, deals with bats very seriously.
She's got 10 trained experts, who perform scans, scans, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also set up the first guard and unit dedicated to bats at the Dmprez and Galawi Reb, which serves as a home for eight out of every 10 bats in Scotland.
The head of the estate, David T. Thompson, said the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here's a fight. We've got a great area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right areas of life.
But many things still don't know about bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand more what they need to prosper."
He stressed the importance of testing for the discovery of bats before performing maintenance work inside the property, since an unintentional destruction of a single stocked nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, and a whole local population could also be destroyed.
The bats are protected sex and killing, harassment and harassment of bats or destruction of their cannon areas, prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Perel, a Scottish officer at a bat guard fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said, "We have much more to learn about our bats and about many of our species. We just don't know what their population is."
Ronaldo cancels the charges of rape while the lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the charges of rape against him "Pike News", and said that people want to advance themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine "Der Schiffel", who published the charges.
The candidate of the Puerto Rican team was charged with rape by an American woman named Kat Rien Yorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the suspect, he then paid her $37,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, reporting Dr. Spiegel on day and day.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million followers in Instagram on the video. He lived a few hours after publication of the claims and read up to Pike News reports.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the player camera that won the D.R. Five times.
They want to advance themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Dr. Spiegel for the charges, to which they were referred as "the unacceptable report of suspicions in the private sphere", according to the Reuters report.
The lawyer Christian Schrtz said that the actor would ask for compensation for ‚Äúinjury‚Äù in the amount corresponding to the substance of the breach, and this is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past few years.‚Äù
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Casino Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Myrga returned, according to the report, to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark County Court in Nadda.
Morgha claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he's a "good guy" in 99 percent that I'm disappointed in one percent.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Morgha also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but then she agreed to arrange outside the courthouse because she felt "scareful about revenge" and was afraid "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old girl says she's now interested in canceling the arrangement because she's still suffering trauma because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Rael Madrid from Master Union during the alleged attack, and this summer to the Italian Euventos Club in a deal worth EUR 100 million.
British forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret forever 'if you lose your position as the leading car manufacturer of the world after the Barksitt, said the British business minister, Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota's interview with Britain to BBC, where he said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, she would temporarily stop the creation of a factory in Brenston, near Darby, was "Medag."
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the delayed influence on the boundaries of Barkzit's case without an agreement could rise in office.
The Brenston plant, which produces the Oris and Evantis samples of Toyota, will produce close to 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of it will go to the rest of the European Union.
From my point of view, if Britain leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, we'll see the end of our factory construction, said Marvin Cook, CEO Tuyota in Bernston.
Other vehicle manufacturers in Britain raised concerns about the departure of the European Union without agreement and how it would affect cross-border trade, including India, BMW, and Viguar Land Rober.
BMW, for example, says she's gonna shut down her mini factory at Oxford for a month after the barbecute.
The main concerns relate to what the vehicle manufacturers call the risks of the supply chain in the case of Barksite without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "right time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes, providing British and the rest of the European Union, creating cars at the invitation.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may cause a fall in the border, and the factors in the sector say they can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota can't keep up with more than a day's worth at the Darbyshire factory, says the company, so the creation will be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's plan, delineating the future relationship of Britain with the European Union, was precisely designed to prevent these tests at the border.
We want to reach the best agreement we can, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity, he said in Today's 4th BBC radio program.
‚ÄúThe evidence from the UV and other car manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful range of supply chains, which we have until this day, is absolutely essential.‚Äù
Toyota didn't say how long the break of creation would last, but for the longer term, she warned that the extra costs would harm the factory's competitions and eventually cause the dismissals.
Peter Zubalaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years, and who served as president of the Union Association in the factory, said that the union is more concerned: "If jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government speaker said: ‚ÄúWe have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.‚Äù
Ramp meeting with Rosestein could be denied again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Lieutenant General Rud Rosestein, whose many depend on it, may be "refused another week" when the battle against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bert Quanano, continues, said the White House on 1st.
Rosestein is an observer of the work of Special Prosecutor Robert M√ºller, who is investigating the Russian intervention in election, links between Tramp's assistants and Russia and the possible breakdown of investigation by the President.
The gossip in Washington has been a deal for months on the question whether Trump will fire the Attorney General and thereby risk Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosestein Dan could carry a wire device to record the calls with Trump and to get the president rejected by the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.
Rosestein denied the report.
But on the last day he came to the White House, and according to the reports, he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting was held for the third day with Trump, which was held during the arrival of Rosestein in the United States in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosestein, but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a conflict with the Senate's hearing, where he testified to Quanano and one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On day and ‚Äò, Trump ordered a FBI investigation for a week on claims against Quanano, and rejected the vote again in the Senate.
Tramp's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on 1st.
In answer to the question about the meeting with Rosestein, she said: "There's still no date for the meeting, she may exist this week, and I can see a rejection for another week, considering what's going on in the Supreme Court.
But we look and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some authors have challenged this determination: Sanders has not established a press briefing of the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the frequency of the radios did not flow from a stand-up run, even though she said, "I'm not going to deny the fact that they're taking a stand."
Then she offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
‚ÄúThe President has more questions and answers than any president before him‚Äù, she said, adding without quoting evidence: ‚ÄúWe have checked the numbers.‚Äù
The press briefing will still be, says Sanders, but if the press has an opportunity to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this on many occasions, and you've seen that we've done this on many occasions in the last few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the President of the United States will replace the press guides."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press parties when he visits.
Just for his press parties, they're rare.
This week in New York, the president may have considered the reason for this, in a free show, and sometimes strange, in front of articles gathered in place.
The Health Service writes to the European Union workers in NHS Scotland and refers to concerns about barbecute.
The Health Service wrote to the European Union staff working at the Scotland National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they stay after the barbecute.
The Scotty Parliament sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to standing up to requests for permanent status for the citizens of the European Union working in its strange public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in a letter: ‚ÄúBy summer, negotiations between Britain and the European Union on exit continued, and he is moving forward to the expected decisions in the fall.
But the British government also increased its honesty to a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this period may be very worrying for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate each team member's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefit the patients and the congregations we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The back guard of the University of Tennis University, Christion Abercombe, had an emergency surgery after he had suffered from the loss of 31-27 on Saturday to the Comodores Group from the University of Wenderblatt, reported by Mike Organ of the tennis.
Rod Reid, chief coach of the tennis University Group, told the writers that the wound occurred shortly before half a century ago.
"He went to the bottom of the field and just collapsed there," said Reed.
The coaches and the medical team gave Abercombie oxygen in the field, and then they put him on a stretch and took him for another test.
An official from the University of tennis told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Bethany, that Barcomby was transferred to surgery at the Wenderblatt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no details about the type/circumstance of surgery" and the University of tennis still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of tennis after the transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five repairs all before he left the game, and he brought up his files all the time to 18.
Alien buyers will be charged with higher bonuses when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will charge higher bonuses when buying property in Britain and extra income will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservation plan.
The move will neutralize Corbin's move success to attract new voters
The Bloom Tax leases are charged to those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The treasure expects the tax to raise up to US$ 120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will commit to a higher rate of tax when they buy property in Britain - plus income will be used to help the homeless, announce Theresa May today.
The move seems to be delayed to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income owners.
No. The stamps are charged to people and companies who are not paying taxes in Britain, and the increase in income will strengthen the government's move to help these old ones under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on two-dollar dwellings and real estate investments - may reach a level of three percent.
The treasure expects the move to be up to US$ 120 million a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the newly built property in London is purchased by foreign residents, the situation that makes it difficult for people who buy it for the first time to set foot on the housing scale.
Many rich areas in the country - and especially in the capital - have become "Rift Cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called to cut the stamps to help young people buy a first house.
He blamed large companies for the expensive costs of building, since they were taking the land but were not using it, and rushed to the back of May to abandon the covers on houses at a reasonable price and to fix Britain's "divorce of residence".
Corbin has announced a series of strategical housing forms, including the monitoring of rent and separations for "no guilt".
He also wants to give Councils greater strength to build new houses.
‚Äú Last year, I said that I would devote my priestly period to the restoration of the British dream ‚Äî which they thought was that life should be better for every new generation.
And what this means is a repair of our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies that are based in foreign countries, can easily own houses as hard working British inhabitants.
The dream of becoming houseowners became too far for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too real."
‚ô™ My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland ‚ô™
Sandland Director Jack Ross said that his ultimate ambition is to become the Director of Scotland at a certain point.
The 42-year-old Scotty takes pleasure in the resurrection challenge of the North East club, which is currently in the third place in the first league, three points from the top of the degree.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Meren back to the first place in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once participated in an international game, and that's it," Ross said to the Scotch Sports BBC program.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team play a lot at the Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I can manage the team."
Former Sandersland directors included Dick Adboutt, David Moiss, Sam Eldace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Foya, and Paulo De Kanu.
The former director of Aloa Altik says that he was not afraid to come after such well-founded names in such a large club, after he had previously turned down bids from Bernsley and Epswich Town.
For me, success will now be determined by whether I can return the club to Permier League?
Because of the building and the facilities in this club, he's definitely belonging to the Fermier League, he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a time as assistant director in Damberton and 15 months as team coach of the Hearts Group.
In the next stage, he helped Aloha get out of league III and raised St. Meren from the cover of the coronation to a position as the winner of the contest at the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepol, Polkrick, St. Myren and Milton Academy.
‚Äú It was a true triumph, ‚Äù he recalled, regarding the taking over of the command of a widow.
‚Äú I truly believed that the management position was more appropriate for me than for the game.
That sounds weird because I played okay, I've probably earned, and I've enjoyed some likely records.
But an actor's career can be hard.
There's a lot of things you need to handle every week.
I'm still dealing with everything about stress and work pressure, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."

The perfect time for Pinette beer is at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, found in the poll.
The heavy summer heat wave of British pubs struggling for their existence, but it caused pressure on restaurant networks.
Pubs and pirre groups enjoyed a sales raise of 2.7 per cent in July - but income at restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, exposed data.
Peter Martin, from CGA Business Advisory, who collected the data, said: "The significance of the clear weather and long-term participation of England in the World's Festivals is that July was a similar pattern to that of June, with the Japanese revenues rising by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more severe beatings.
The 1.8 percent drop in trade at the restaurants in June just got worse in July.
Pubs and wells focused on drinks recorded the most powerful performances, with a higher increase than the reduction of income in restaurants, compared to the previous time.
The food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was dramatic less than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Between pub nets and wells, the consumption of drinks rose by 6.6 percent over the month, and the food sales fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM data analysis in the field of fashion and hospitality, said: ‚ÄúThese results continue to be the one we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social events or events are the most important factors in the outhouse market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful as well as for all half of the regular costs.
The long and warm summer couldn't have arrived at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time would have said if the cooler temperatures we had in August would have brought about what they needed so much."
Only the growth in the sales of pancakes and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and the slow-down surface of branding.

One out of every five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey revealed that one in five children - only 11 years old - has secret accounts in the social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
Survey, including 20,000 middle class students, revealed a growth in fake "Insta" pages.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of students said they have a "head" account that they show to parents
One out of five children - only 11 years of age - creates accounts in the social media he keeps a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle class students revealed a rapid growth in "false Insta" accounts as a reminder of the photo sharing site, Instagram.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean "head" account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was asking others to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awarence UK and the HMC of the British Independent Schools found that 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two experienced and happy academics who have private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "The so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elyde Doyle will serve as a "voice for athletes" in the Scottish athletes' board.
Elyde Doyle was elected to the Scottish board of athletes for an external directorate at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most serious athlete and the headman of Ian Betty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who provide the sports branches to benefit from the rich international experience over the last decade.
‚ÄúElde won a great honor among the Scottish, British, and world athletes, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from what you saw in the board, ‚Äù says Betty.
Doyle said: "I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes and to hope that I can contribute and really help with the pursuit of sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic games in 1996 in Atlanta, and in four Olympic gold medals in all, and is now regularly used as a resident on the BBC network, lost his ability to walk after a passing brain stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúA month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it would only be time to say if or to what extent you would be healed.
It was a bad job, but I totally recovered, learning how to go, and today it's a quick exercise and a quick response!
Thanks for the cheerleaders!
Adherence to Soil Sources The same is true of mothers for online opinion parties.
A friend of the Philega milk plant has opinions on the Internet with a awareness that corresponds to a mother‚Äôs being cleaned up and a cow‚Äôs milk.
To mention the pump field that was supposed to be the world's first silent milk supply, Elvie's private user technology company published an advert video in order to illustrate the freedom of action that the new supply gives mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a barn full of straw cows for a song containing words like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it's not thin, it's my breasts."
The song possum goes on and says, "The water, the water, I feed the babies, the water, the water, I milk my girls."
But the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of reactions, the video got mixed up by the viewers, and many said it sheds light on the "worsty" of the milk industry.
‚Äú The decision was very bad to use fruit to publish the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after escape," wrote someone.
Elvie's milk supply is mixed with disparate within the clean bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another reaction said: ‚ÄúTremblably, the cow and the circle are one.
But hey, why don't you use them to publish a milk supply to mothers who have the right to keep their babies?"
Another response said, "Person is totally cut off."
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was a "screaming."
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still cleaning up.
The bite made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I've been referring to her contents.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another response said: "It's a funny ad for mothers who lie (often in their places of work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows."
It's no awareness that you're praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group finds out they've all been dancing with the discreet resources in their fronts.
The idea that behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women, who use a milk pump, feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it's superbly blending in the cleaning bra and giving women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to get out during the drive.
Anna Blarin, a partner and responsible member of the early development department in Mother, pointed out: "Elvie's supply is such a decisive and prophylactic product.
In creating a comparison between women who express themselves and dairy plants, we wanted to place the milk spring and all the challenges it has in the light of the shootings, and to illustrate in a way that, which you can identify, the amazing sense of freedom that the new resource will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump does titles.
During London's fashion week, a mother for two kids walked the track for the designer Martha Jakovsky using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly transferred to camp at Texas.
Although the number of immigrant children in custody is still at the border of the month remains relatively unchanged, one reason is that the director of Trump's bush and police tried to force the children to move in to the caregivers.
Often, caregivers were immigrants without documents themselves, and they feared that they could stay in the country in a position of responsibility for a child.
The risk is a man in June, when the federal authorities have announced potential caregivers and other adult housekeepers will have to deliver fingerprints, and these data will be associated with immigration authorities.
Last week, U Albans, a senior officer at the Immigration and Excise Authority, testified to Congress that it had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care without supervision.
The permission then approved 70 percent of the detainees had not been criminal before.
* Close to 80% of the caregivers or their homes are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albans.
With a view to dealing with solutions for children more quickly, the officers introduced new laws requiring a section of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as accepted by previous regulations, the shelter workers were reported.
Many will appear through a video conference, instead of a face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before a immigration judge.
Those who won't be found will be released quickly.
The longer these children stay, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or runaway attempts, the more likely they have been to report from the system in recent months.
Panellors say that these fears are being overcome by larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of the child‚Äôs difficulty are likely to be reduced, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to the city of tents without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to separate them from friends could make the trauma that many already face worse.
Syria says to the American, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw too much.
In the face of the UN's general arrest, the Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Absenced also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
The Commissioner, also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally located on the territory of Syria, under the excuse that they were fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw too often and without conditions," he said to stop.
The "war of terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight against this holy war until we clear the Syrian land of the terrorist organizations and any illegal presence that she is as one.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in need of training and advice to the Korean and Syrian forces opposing the President of L-Aced.
France has over 1,000 warriors on the land of the wars.
As far as the type of refugees are concerned, the conditions for their return are good and the charges of "certain Western states" in the "discretion of unreasonable fears" that caused refugees to stay away.
‚Äú We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return, ‚Äù he said.
They only make a policy of a kind that should be humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no relief to the rebuilding of Syria until a political agreement had been reached between East and Oasisia to end the war.
Diplomatics from the United Nations say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up an arrow zone in Idelev, from the last major rebel holding, created an opportunity to advance the political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the province, where three million people lived.
However, the emphasis was placed on the agreement was clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the Yad warriors, and on all the fighters from the battle of victory linked to Al-Qaida, which would be ‚Äúdestructed‚Äù.
United Nations messenger Stefan de Mistura hopes to meet soon the first meetings of a new committee, which is composed of members of the government and of Oasisia, to draft a post-war constitution and to pave the way for elections.
He set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to ‚Äútesting the current Constitution‚Äù, and warned against interference.
Why would Tramp win a second cance?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-selected in 2020, unless, as many liberals expect, rejection and scandal will be completed earlier.
While there is no doubt about it, the most dramatic end of the history of the presidents of all time!
Right now, no signs of fatigue at the viewers.
Since 2014, the average average of the peaks has risen to 1.05 million in CNNs and almost 1.6 million in MSNBCs.
The average Fox News stands at 2.4 million observers at record hours, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Madow Show" in MSNBC, reached the top of the cable's ratings with up to 3.5 million watching important news.
"This is the fire that people are attracted because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, which deals with the Secretary of State who becomes President after an attack destroys the beer.
Lanne Skobal, an old comedy writer and writer, "Only the funny parts: and a few difficult truths about the retaliation into the Hollywood Man's Day" have a different theory.
She remembers a cab trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he's laughing at me," she told me Mrs. Skobal.
The chaos has value in entertainment.
Of course, different from all other TV programs, the D.C.F.'s guidelines could determine the future of "Roo v. Weid", could immigrant families reunite and the health of the world economy.
Substitution of a channel or neglect are a luxury that only the most relevant viewers can afford.
And yet, you're running from the limits of being educated citizens when you've been watching yourself for six hours on the panel of experts using Bob Woodward as a source of "fear" book.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Some of what he does, which gives a feeling similar to that of a reality plan, is that he feeds you in something every night," said Bert Montgomery, CEO, and the "Historic for Sales", about the team that switches to a drama show and the day-to-day turns of the NFL.
You can't afford to lose one chapter or you'll stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, there was a light outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of the Caoy Island, but he challenged to watch the MSNBC, and recorded the CAN in parallel.
He couldn't break off, not when Bert Quananu was preparing to stand before the Senate's Legal Commission and the future of the Supreme Court depending on the balance.
"I remember the times when we had all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Place.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from external sources is expecting the race for election to the middle of the busiest Consequent.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of Congress districts, which brought to the race of two Congressmen for the same seat.
The province of Pittsburgh, whose borders were recently re-ratified, placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb -- who won his place in another district, with special elections in the last spring.
Lamb runs against another Congressman, Republican Keith Ruth Foss, who today represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is largely traversed with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were reenacted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded in January that the division of the former provinces had been damaged, and contrary to the Constitution, the results were for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a fight against financial diamonds in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became a salesman in Pennsylvania after a close victory at the March special election, which won a wide view, for Congress's 18th district in Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point district.
Political commentators have seen a small advantage for the democracys.
The U.S. was considered to punish Al Salvador for support in China, and then returned.
Diplomatics indicated that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met Big'ing, with a mild opposition on the part of Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Carlos Varla of Panama, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners divorced the management team of Tramp.
Foreign Office officials decided to return the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a response to the "last decisions not to know any more about Taiwan", said Dr. Nourt, the office spokesperson, in an announcement at the beginning of the month.
But the penalty charge was only imposed against Salvador, which, according to the estimate of $140 million from the United States in 2017, included drug control, financial development and support.
The proposed penalties, including cutbacks in economic aid and restrictions on entry certificates, could have hurt a country in Central America suffering from unemployment and high murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that took place as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-Saturber, senior government officials made their wishes clear about the promotion of the convention, thus ending all my judgements against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Fance is now supposed to turn to the conference participants, who are now scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance that the government attaches to him, said the diplomats.
And three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
The White House Speaker of Balton refused to respond to the discussion's privacy described by the three American officials, and in all two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal debates, on condition that they would be well-attended.
Their explanations were recovered by an external analyst, near the government, who also spoke out there.
Learning History
What follows may come from the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the alleged failure of Trump's investigation, whose back now exists significant evidence of public records.
Muller turns his investigation, according to the reports, to ask whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in attacks on our election system.
If it changes in Congress, Trump will find himself giving a sentence and an account for this body, just as soon as he's ready to stand up to the voters again, and maybe a jury.
There are many questions here that start with "M" and I do not intend to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable, not the same as the same role holders in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect the length of time that may prolong the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been ready to commit a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported the Chech in Manna.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the deadly years as a result.
History moves around such directional points, and democracy steps that are not unstoppable, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such points.
What do we do if Trump fires Lieutenant General Rod Rosestein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosestein has been in trouble since this press reported last year that he offered to secretly record the president and brought up the ideas about his incompetence to presidents.
Rosestein said the Times report was not accurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I. investigation into the subject of Bert Quanano, which was recently requested, is not full or fair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of the allegations of sexual assault and false witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-Central election and appoint a Congress that will take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will get into a long winter sleep.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew who was expelled from Oshitrich by the Nazi regime that also had sheep in the past the most famous house I had.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the same table that carried the broken cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from the Ring. Optimist to the battle in Rabid Vienna.
The Ring's host to Rapid Vienna on 'em, and you know we'll win the Austrias, after the impressive case against Virial in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to take over the G group of the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorans from showing up for the first time in the season up to line 2-2 with Viriel, but he believes that Reese can use this result as a jumpboard for better performances.
"It was a good point for us because Viriel is a good team," said 31-year-old football.
We went out of the game with faith that we could get something and get a point.
We could have won at the end, but, in all things, his case was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we got out of the freezer in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday's gonna be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a hard game because they got a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can press and get a positive outcome.
The last year was really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and make it.
Women stay awake because of this fear about pension savings
Despite the fact that the surveyers had a clear idea about how they wanted to be treated, only a few people were talking about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in a national survey said they were talking to couples about the cost of long-term dietary treatment.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
‚ÄúPeople want a family member to take care of them, but they don‚Äôt take steps to conduct the conversation, ‚Äù says Holly Niider, deputy president of the National Security Society.
You can do it next way.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: you can't prepare the family for treatment if you don't express your wishes long before the deadline.
Use the counsellor and your family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, since these choices may be a significant factor in costing.
The consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include long-term traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy with an amount of money that will help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your fortune - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents, and find an early solution to legal conflicts at this time.
Find him and give him strength to health matters, a trustworthy man who will oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
It was also considered signing a force-free signature in all respect of your money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your place and promise to settle accounts if you are inadequate.
Don't forget the little details: imagine your adult parent has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines or allergies?
We mentioned these details in an address plan to be ready.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors, too?" asked Martin.
What are the drugs?

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people found their deaths in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, said official sources, and the death plant was expected to rise.
The disaster led to the break-up of the media networks and the official agents responsible for the aid couldn't get information from Dongala County, a area in northern Palau that was closer to the noise source itself of 7.5.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people turned after the disaster hit.
There's a few facts before you about Palo and Dungala, in Solawsey Island:
Palo is the capital of the province of central Sulawsey, located at the end of a narrow island on the west coast of the island of Sulawsey, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017, according to estimates.
The city mentioned its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and the earthquake hit her.
Dongala is the district of the south-west of Sulawsy Island, over 100 miles (180 km).
The population of the district, a district of administration in the region, stood according to estimates of 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of the Province are fish and agriculture, especially in the Dongala coastal area.
Another important source of income is the nickel radiation, mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite side of Sulawsey.
Palo and Dungala have been hit several times by waves of tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dungala.
A tsunami also hit West Dungala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the area of the Pacific fire ring, known for its seismic activity, and it has been hit in a constant way by earthquakes.
Before you are a few of the greatest tsunamis and waves of the past few years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ech, north of Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 22,000 people along the shoreline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the dead found their death in the Gulf.
A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nis Island, across the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 hit south of Ava, Indonesia's most inhabited island, causing a tsunami that exploded on the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake in itself of 7.6 hit the area by the city of Padang, the capital of the Province of Western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake in itself of 7.5 hit one of the Mantauwi Islands, in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 feet [10 m] in height, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: Ground earthquake hit the D.A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-E.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.-B.-A.-A.-A.,-A.-A.-A.-A.-A.,-A.-A.,...-A.-B.-A..-B.-A.-A.
The earthquake didn't cause tsunamis in this case, but more than 100 people were killed from buildings that crashed.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Flynn's eldest son was arrested for family violence
The former U.S. vice president, Sarah Flynn's eldest son, governor of Alaska, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Fileen, from the city of Wesila in Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, the report of family violence and the opposition to arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by Alaska's police forces.
According to the police report, when a salesman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Flynn is held in custody at the Mat-su-Partriel facility under $500 own guarantees, according to a report of the KTU TV channel.
According to the Internet reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, and declared himself not guilty, for sure, when he was asked to ease his claims.
Flynn was charged with three A-type conduct crimes, which could, therefore, be imprisoned for a year and fined for $250,000.
He's also charged with B-type conduct, on which her mouth could be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time criminal charges were filed against Philyn.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Flynn.
His mother, Sarah Flynn, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is now in front of Alaska's loose soldiers court.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, of breaking the report of a crime of family violence, and of holding a weapon under rent in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her.
Groups of released soldiers criticized Sarah Flynn in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to the traumatized post stress disorder created by his service in Iraq.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the island of Indonesia on day and day.
The earthquake, in the strength of 7.5, caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and media networks have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit close to the center of Solawsey, north-east to the Indonesian capital, J. Carta.
Movies, posted on social networks, show the moment of injury.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami exploded on the beach.
Federal prosecutions are asking for a rare death penalty to suspect a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutions in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sypolo Sypov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City who killed eight people - rarely executed for federal crime in the country since 1953.
30-year-old Sypov used the claim in a rented truck of the Depot House to carry out a bike attack on the side of the Westside highway south of Manhattan, and Dres walked and rode on a bike that got on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutions must prove that Sypov killed eight victims ‚Äúfirst intentionally‚Äù and caused severe injuries to the body, according to a statement of intent to claim the death penalty, which was filed in the southern quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, the death penalty may be imposed on these two indictments.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court member set up for Sypov with an indictment of 22 cases, including eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, which usually uses federal prosecutions in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "significant and deliberate planning first," said the prosecutions, describing the way Sypub carried out the attack as "dignity, cruel and sick."
"Sipolo Hafiblvech" caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Ang Linni, Nicholas Klabbs, NLOR-Dad, Darn Drake, Ariel Arleg", Hern√°n Proch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pinoco, written in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time that New York's southern quarter was sued with death penalty in the case, it took place a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but we were eventually sentenced to World Prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after their conviction for having been convicted of having a connection there for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The two Rosenberg spouses were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court records, Sipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret in the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said police.
Sypov told the authorities that the inspired bar was being attacked after watching his phone noise videos, according to the reporter.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of noise in the hospital where he stayed.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-year-old indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal parliaments representing Sypov, said they were "sadden of course" from the decision of the case.
‚Äú We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt that will lead to a world imprisonment without the possibility of being released, ‚Äù said Patton.
Sypov's Senate team has previously asked the prosecutions not to require a death penalty.
A member of Parliament who keeps saying there's got to be a "L-Frag" dealer in charge of the Barxite negotiations.
Naigl Prag's vow to recruit the people's army today during a protest at the Conservatory Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said that politicians must feel pressure from the Europeans - when a member of a parliament of the Theresa Maye Guard Party claimed that he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Parliamentary Member Peter Bonn said in a march in Birmingham that Britain was already outside at this point if Prague was a Presbyter as Secretary of the Barxite.
But the challenge ahead of May, the very loose lines of the guards, was highlighted by the joining of the guards who supported the European Union's membership in a different demonstration against the Berxite in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to leave her settlement plan, the Crash, on her way, despite attacks by the barxite supporters, the supporters of the stay and from the European Union.
The Allies stood up to her continuing to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-actions and force the Aerocapists and the Laver Party to choose between her agreement and chaos and chaos.
Bon said at the meeting of the Leave Men's Leave group in Solihol that he wanted to break up with the Crash.
He claimed that Prague had to be admitted as a friend and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out at this point', he said.
I'll protect the barbecute, but we need to break up with the Cres.
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: "We have not fought two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone cancelled the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely false.
She was also on the move and said to the authors: "I simply say: the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
It's not popular in a broad public battle, it won't vote for her, it's not popular among our party and among our activists who go to the streets and choose us in the first place.
Please, let go of the Crash and start listening.
In a critical message, she added: ‚ÄúThe heads of government keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ‚Äù
Prague said at the conference that it is necessary to make politicians feel the pressure if they're going to betray a decision that was made at the request of the people in 2016.
Now it's about the question of trust between us, the people, and our political status, he said.
They're trying to betray Barksitt, and we're here today to tell them that you can't get away with it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience, "I want you to make our political status, which is about to betray Berkezit, feel pressure.
We call this country's people's army, which has given us the victory in Berxite and will never rest until we become independent, ruling and proud Britain.
At that moment, the remaining supporters walked in Bermingham, and then they had a two-hour conference in the middle of town.
An active bunch was blown away by the guard announcements against Barksitt after the group was set up at the end of the week.
Laiver Lord Syds laughed at the opening of the conference to the guards about the security problems they suffered with the party app.
It's about people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology possible to form an agreement like Canada plus plus, across a border without waiting and free trade without borders in Ireland', he added.
That's totally ridiculous.
There's no such thing as a good barxite, he's added.
Warren's planning to seriously consider running for president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's "consider seriously running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Global newspaper reports that the Democratic Senator from West spoke of a future during a city meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often visits President Donald Trump, is facing the elections of mid-Country in November against Republican Jeff Diell, who served as co-chair of the Trump election campaign in West in 2016.
She was standing in the middle of the rumors that she might face Trump in 2020.
The Hallock event, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in a town building meeting since his entry into Trump's office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and to have a woman take the lead.

Grand Perry Russia: Louis Milton ends up with a world degree after the team graduates gave him a victory over Sebastian Walt
It was clear, from the moment Walter Botas came to the next stage before Louis Milton on Saturday, the Mars team graduates would play an important role in the race.
For the first time, Loboas was a good start, and he almost left Milton alone while protecting his place in the first two rounds and inviting Walt to attack his teammate.
Walt first made a midway stop and let the Himlitone fit into the competition tail, apparently a decisive decision.
The Mars team went to a midway stop later and returned to the race behind Walt, but Milton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle that the sucker finally had to leave the inner path to stay safe after a double move on the third corner.
Max Verstapan, who celebrates his 21st birthday, started from the back line of the graduation and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and pass Kimmy Reikonan to the fourth place.
He ended up in a middle stop on round 44 and couldn't increase the pace of the remaining rounds when Ryconan dried the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Walter's been doing a great job all weekend and it was a real gentleman when he let me get around it.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to Dabble," said Milton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump celebrates Senator Diane Finstein at a meeting on Saturday, in connection with her insistence on not leaking a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing the High Court of Bert Quanano of sexual assault.
When speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the witnesses that Ford gave to the Senate's Legal Commission, instead of saying that the Senate event shows that people are "sinners, dishonorers and liars".
‚ÄúThe only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, unkind, and liars, ‚Äù he said.
* When you look at the publications and the switches, then they say, ‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Pinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he was added to the Senator's imitation.
Finestein received a letter detailing the charges against Queeno another July, and he leaked earlier in September, but Finstein denied the leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," said Pinstein to the committee, according to the reports of The Hill.
"She asked me to keep his secrets and to keep the secrets of the letter as requested by me."
But it doesn't seem that the Senator's denial was accepted by the President, who responded to her during the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she's not. But it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to protect the candidate of the Supreme Court, who was accused of misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using charges for their purposes.
‚Äú They are determined to return to the rulership at all costs.
You see the convictions, the contempt, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're running on their way to control and power," said the President, according to Mediate's report.

A plane crashed in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says that one person is missing after the crash of an aircraft in Belgium.
The airport, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Garden of Micronesia, now says that one person is missing after earlier declaring that all 47 passengers and crew members have safely escaped the plane.
Air New Guinea said in a announcement that it started in the afternoon on Saturday, it couldn't say what happened to one passenger's fate.
The airport said it was working with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his birth or his citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water, while trying to land at the airport of C.C.
Officials said that day and day seven people were taken to a hospital.

The reason for the crash and the exact events are still unclear.
The U.S. Airport and Navy said the plane landed in Belgium a little distance from the track.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane had missed the track.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane came to a very low track.
"That's a very positive thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to clear their way into the emergency exits at the top of the sink plane.
He said the plane crew was nervous and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.

Analyst specializes the events the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved her claim on Saturday, in a retrial trial of a man charged with the burning of a Mexican woman while alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roultt, U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of clinical surgery.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to link the prosecution's motions, Queenton Telis, 29 years old, and the victim's movements, Jessica Chambers 19 the night she was murdered.
According to the clarion report to the R.R., Roult said he received the location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chembers on the night he died, hiding his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chembers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sandford was on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town the same day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was true when he said that he was with Sandford that night, Sanford said that he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another hiding was that Telis said he knew Chembers two weeks before he died.
The mobile phone records testified that they knew each other only a week.
Roult said that some time after the death of Chembers, Telis deleted the text messages, the calls, and the Cumbers' contacts from his phone.
"He removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin with her closing speech on day one, as planned.
The judge said he expected the trial to be transferred to the jury's debate at a later stage that day.

Another black man?
A New York doctor is suing a couple for a divorce after texting "racial"
A New York doctor is suing a couple for a black-root divorce after receiving a text message that was not meant for her from the fact that he complained that the patient was another black person.
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the case to "Smuggling."
Lincee Flasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she found out that she was taking care of her new children, Jeselle Morris, was black when she arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"No-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A" wrote Ms. Flasco-Flexman to her husband in text.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a report by the New York Post, after she noticed that the Flasco-Flexman had fired Mrs Morris, and said that the former African-American therapist had done a terrible job, and that she was now expecting to hire a Philippinesman in her place.
Mrs. Morris got paid for one day's work and sent to her house with Ober.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for the divorce, asking for $350 a day for six months of work and living in a place for which he was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, I don't do things like this," she said to Post the day and "and add "I know it's a black."
The couple returned a war on allegations that they were racist and said that the end of Morris' business was required, out of fear they couldn't trust her after they had hurt her.
'My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said her husband, Val Flasco, to Post.
But did he have your child in the hands of someone you might have been rude, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Flasco compared the case to the "Smuggling" and said that his wife was supposed to be born only two months before the event and was "in a very difficult situation".
Do you want to pursue someone like her?
It's not nice to do anything like that." Add the investment banker.
The court case is still in proceedings, but the public opinion court quickly raised the couple in the social media, killing their behaviour and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that the editors of Pedington's light were afraid that the readers would not be able to recognize a bear speaking to them.
Bond's daughter, Karen G'Nekel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about Peddington's enormous success."
Having said that her father, who worked at BBC, as a camera before the inspiration father wrote the book of the little toy, would become blood-staining about the rejection of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "baby-baby" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Peddington's success, which was described as a "very important friend of our family."
"He was a quiet man, not a proud man," she said.
But because Peddington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a child who got something: you're proud of him, though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Peddington's success kind of like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Peddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her hello on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was placed in a state of terror to Louis Paster 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
Ned just called and said that she was really bad, that she wasn't expected to last."
Then I got a call from Mand, where he said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashie, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The meds the doctors gave her to keep her going were slowly gone and out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it all happens.
I couldn't open my heart or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Ms. Adnan Lapros, now in exile for the loss of her daughter, was on board a plane by other passengers who were unaware of the past painful journey.
No one knew," she said.
My head was in danger, and tears fell out all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had an amazing sense of identity with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women hanging on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved men who committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly, who are on a bridge in Walsh with inspired messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, living in Lidney, said her son was a promised chef with a sticky smile.
‚Äú All recognized him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the same time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm afraid of a chain reaction.
Mrs. Davis has created the discoveries so people will know that there's someone that can be approached and spoken, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in the blood -- you need to talk."
Mrs. Hampiz, Mrs. Davis' girlfriend in years, lost Mark, a partner in 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
‚Äú A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was down the stairs on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened the presents he didn't contact you with an eye or something."
She said that his death was an enormous trauma for them, but they overcome it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Bert Quanano stands on the balance as the FBI starts his investigation.
'I thought, if we could really get what we asked for -- a time-limited and limited investigation -- maybe we could bring only to a union',' Flyke said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the "scattered" committee was off the established party shutdown.
Why were the Republican supporters and Quanano not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their conviction is entirely based on timing.
The council elections will take place only five more weeks, on November 6, and if, as a result, the Republicans will not succeed, they will be very weak in their attempts to bring about the choice of the man they want the highest court in the country.
George Wush picked up the phone and called the Senators to help them support Cowano, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI gets his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently appointed.
It's still not clear if Quanano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, to allow Vice-President Mike Fance to break the equation and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of rebels in North Korea is going down under Kim.
The number of North Koreans in South Korea has come down since Kim Jung-un was taken over seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Bung Sig Park, quoted data from the South Korean Union Office, said last year the number of rebels stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main factors of this were the more severe control of the border between North Korea and China in terms of the amount of people's escape.
Pinging didn't make a public statement.
The overwhelming majority of the deserts in North Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross in comparison with the military territory (DMZ) has been well maintained between two Korean countries.
China refers to the deserters as illegal, non-partisans and often returns them into exile.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war, has improved dramatically in the last few months.
Earlier, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on nuclear disarmament negotiations.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un in Singapore, where the two agreed in general to act towards an era when the half of the Korean island would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yung-ho, blames the sanctions that the United States has imposed on the lack of progress since then.
"without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally withdraw our weapons first," said Ray in his speech to the UN's general arrest in New York.
Nancy Flossey calls Bert Quanano "Histry," saying he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The underprivileged leader of the House, Nancy Flossy, called the High Court's "Histry" and said that Opio would not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flossy responded to this at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas.
I couldn't think that if a woman ever showed up like that, they would say "Histrian", Flossey said about how she responded to Quano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the day of 'em.
Quanano openly rejected the allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both adults.
During his opening speech, Quananu was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and sneered when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also spoke in the form of democratics on the Committee and called for the arguments against him ‚ÄúA compatible character murder and Grotsky‚Äù organized because of the liberals ‚Äô anger that History Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Flossy said that Quananu's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed a prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he's done away with these statements and the way he's been chasing the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Flossy tried when she asked whether she would try to remove Quananu if his appointment would be happy, and if the Democrats were to win most of the election house.
'I say so-- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI then he doesn't fit, not only to serve in the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he's currently serving,' said Flossey.
Quanano is now serving as judge in the Federal Court of Inventments of Columbia County.
Flossy added that she's a democrat, she has concerns about possible interruptions of Quanano against Obama's health or his judgment against Wade, since he was considered a guard judge.
At his approval hearing, Quananu avoided wishes regarding the possibility of canceling certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
‚Äú There‚Äôs no reason why a hysterical man and a thief should come to court and expect it to be said, ‚Äò It‚Äôs not great, ‚Äô said Flossey.
And women have to use it.
It's a severe criticism, months and years of rage rising on his cheeks, and it can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?"
She continued, ‚ÄúI got a lot of help from a woman who was managing elsewhere, who said that she also cried when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started to cry, she used to tell the man you talked about, ‚Äò You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just pulled on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The other one, because they are not built in the same way as they are.
One of my most meaningful memories from early in my life, in an office with most of my men, is that I once found myself crying in an inexplicable rage, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cold manager from whom I was always a little scared and dragged me into the stairs.
"Don't let them see you're ever crying," she told me.
'They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've been able to suppress you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the same time a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the election trips conducted for presidents.
In 1987, when Hart was caught by an extramarital affair manager on a ship named Monkey Business and came out of the race, Schroider, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of dealing with the president herself.
'It wasn't a decision I thought about,' she told me 30 years later and laughed.
‚Äú There were seven other candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another challenge.
Someone called it snow and the seven tires.
Because she joined the election campaign at a later stage, she was forced to raise funds, so she swore she wouldn't join the race unless she hired $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who contributed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting laid?" She was wondering.
During the speech that you won't be opened on an official election campaign, the feelings of gratitude for the people you've supported, you'll wonder about the system you've been using so hard to earn money and about the focus on choosing instead of representatives, and you'll be angry with the sexual darkness - she's suffocated with tears.
'I might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' she recalled being organized in the way the newspapers responded to her.
You might have thought that I had been taken care of by Klinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my situation?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China War of Trade could be useful to Big'ing
The opening blocks of the U.S.-China trade war were eary, and although the battle was far from over, a split between countries could be useful to Big'ing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the opening shot earlier this year when the tax tax on important Chinese exports and all solar, steel and aluminium.
The most significant settlement occurred this week with new novels that affected products worth $200 billion (150 million pounds), in actually offsetting taxes on half of the goods delivered to the United States of America from China.
Bigby'ing responded on every occasion in the same coin, and recently it's up to 10% on American goods worth $60 billion.
China committed to bringing back a strike on every U.S. strike, and it's unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
A request from D.C. to return means submission to her demands, but a public election to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, which is J.J.
However, experts say that if Big'ing manages correctly, the pressures from the U.S. War of Trade can be positively supported in China in the long term, and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
‚ÄúThe fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic volatility in each of the countries is actually much more dangerous than they ever saw in India‚Äù, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, on the New American Security.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says she's willing to voluntarily return refugees and call for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in a long war for over seven years.
Speaking in front of the arrest of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Absenced said the conditions in the country are improving.
‚Äú Now the situation in the region is more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the war of terrorism, ‚Äù he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the free return of the refugees to the country that they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic steps aimed at harming their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Absenced said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he emphasized that the regime would not get any voluntary assistance or assistance from countries that put the rebels in place.

The U.S. team fought all weekend to find its way through the lawn, except Patrick Reid, Stan Thomas and Tony Pinau, who played a high-level golf for the whole tortoise.
Captain Jim Pierrick spoke after the disappointments of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll be reorganized. I'll work with the American professional golf union and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take the hat off.
We've been defeated."
