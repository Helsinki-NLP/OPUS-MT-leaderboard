The steel needle was watching over the surface of the water because of the pressure of the face.
Internal tension is caused by the water molecules on the surface that are more attractive to each other than the air molecules on which they rise.

Of course, the reality of photons is much smaller than those shown in the picture.
The photons are smaller than even the materials that contain the atoms!
Hundreds of hours later, the heat line was eventually burned and the light was no longer working.
