Wellsh amm is concerned about the "specify" of the WWM
Some EMs have become depressed on the assumption that they must have been called to the EMs (members of the Walsh Parliament).
The issue arose because of the plans to change the name of the congregation to the Walsh Parliament.
The EMs in the political world are concerned that they can bring ridicule.
A Liberian E.M. group said that they were concerned that he would be confronted with “Tidewuby and Peedulupy”.
To readers outside Wells, it means a fool in the Walsh Tiedwuppie, and Peedlippy has crossed.
According to one Plyde M.M., the group “was not happy” and suggested options.
According to the Walsh Racist, his group has a "receptive mind" about the change, but it is a short upword from the e-mail to the Mapet.
Here the Walsh alphabet is similar to that where the book is read in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Congregation, which is currently preparing the law to introduce similar changes, states: “Every person who describes what members of the Congregation are called is really the final decision of his own members.”
The Wells Constitution of 2017 granted the Wells Congregation the power to change its name.
In June, he published a broad public consultation on how to call the assembly the Walsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the EMs, the commission selected members of the Walsh Parliament or the WWMPs, but the option of eMdlupy was supported by public consultation.
The EMs are offering options in public, but it may be a head start to reach the agreement in which they are expected to pass the change laws within weeks.
The law on the expulsion of EMs, including other changes in the way the assembly is conducted, includes the Committee's rules and regulations.
When the EMs argue against the law, they find the last vote on the question of who to be called.
The Macedonians made a choice to change their country’s name when they returned to their homeland
The voters will choose to call the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The public election was made to resolve the ten-year conflict that had existed with the neighboring Greek country, Macedonia, with its own kingdom.
Athens has repeatedly opposed her call for membership in Jehu and Netto, claiming that the name of her northern neighbor would indicate a question on her territory.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to the choice of a name change, stated that he did not pay attention to the choice.
However, high-level ministers, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zayev, say that the name-change is an easy-to-payable fee to be a member of Yu and NATO.
When churches in Harlem fought, St. Martin’s bells were quiet
“The leaders I've talked about in history were on every corner of the barbecue and church, ” said Mr. Adam.
"There's none today."
They said it could be possible to eliminate the bombs.
Today, they say, "People have a different social relationship".
"Bunabes are no longer the local salon houses where people are regular."
According to the leaders, the money from the sale of property to the churches is a threat to them, “and they're in the place where they're starting soon.”
As the churches have further stated, housing buildings may be replaced by homes filled with people who do not care for the rest of the community.
“Many people in this area who buy common housing will become white,” he said, “and so it is urgent that these churches will close, since most people who come to these homes are not expected to be members of these churches.”
Both churches were formerly built by white assemblies in the city community in 1870, St. Martin after ten years.
The main white metodic assembly was released in the 1930s.
A recent black assembly has owned the building.
St. Martin was led by the priest John Howard Johnson on the 125th Streets of Harlem, who were about to hire or raise blacks in the Black Congregation.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged, but Faser Johnson planned to rebuild his parishioners, and he also set up a musical instrument.
The priest David Johnson, the son of Fraser Johnson, and St. Martin's successor, called the most prominent musical instrument "the poor's bells".
In the past, experts who played the musical instrument in Hamley called it something else: "cultural wealth" and "historic instrument".
The University of Michigan has also played the world's first musical instrument by the black musician who turned to the most popular musical instrument in 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Marywezer, St. Martin didn't replace him.
Over the past few months, St. Martin has been the story of some of the church leaders and others of the complex archaeology and concertaries who came to the head in his sermon.
House-to-place-to-place, the governing body of the church leaders, even though the country's office did not participate in the process of the construction of architecture and contractors, he wrote in Hamley that “he wants to spend his expenses on the house”.
Some Muslims complain that there is a personal problem through his country's sermon.
Asa, a 13 - year - old girl who had been playing for Lobster in California, was permanently injured
On Saturday, at the Lobster opening in California, authorities reported that Asa had been injured by a 13-year-old boy who had been playing a permanent Lobster.
The damage occurred shortly before 7 a.m. in Incinitas near the Bay of Beken.
Chad Hamell Sandigo said to the KSWB-TV that on Saturday morning they were dating friends for about half an hour, and they took the boy to the team to get him out of the water.
At first, Hamell thought it was a pleasure to catch Lobster, but they said that they knew that he was shouting 'I'm being hit'.
'I'm hurt!'
The whole blessing was opened, and he said that they immediately noticed it with his son.
"I said out loud that everyone would come out of the water: 'There's a check in the water!'
The child was taken by plane from the Radi Children's Hospital in Sandigo, where he was listed as a dangerous person.
Asa, who caused the disaster, was not known as a permanent race.
As Katin Larry Giles stated in a media statement a few weeks earlier, Asa had been in the area, but he was not a dangerous and durable descendants of Asa.
According to Gils, the victim has caused terrible damage to the upper part of his body.
The authorities have closed the sea coast for 48 hours, from the Ponto Coast in Casablad to Swamis in Incinitas, for the purpose of investigation and security.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 permanent species of Assa in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Ensbury’s Familiar Market Plans for Yuke
With professional support from the workers at Censbury, it features large-scale, multi-computer, bubits, and debenhams.
As the country's fashion and sales decline, the ✔2.8 billion-pressure body, the largest beauty displays, are tried in 11 stores across the country, and if this succeeds, they will be taken to more stores the following year.
Supermarkkets on beauty are coming when they save the sites that once claimed for TV, heating and household items.
According to Censbury, it doubles its supplies of beauty, including patents, essy, tweezerman, and do/r, for the first time.
Since the start of the Chorrell, Mabellyn and Burts Bits, the products that are now available have more places than the brands that are similar to those in such stores as Bots.
The Supermarkket also re-initiates the size of the botikub to make products that are highly needed by young consumers only for garden eaters.
In addition, the Fragrans store, which is the market, attempts to cut down the two Sinsbury stores, the first of which was opened in South London last week, and the second will be opened in Birmingham, Celly Oak, this year.
The purchase of Online and the purchase of small amounts of food each day, if appropriate, means that Supermarkes must do more to persuade people to visit them.
According to the Cinsbury's principal businessman, Mike Kuppe, in an attempt to cheat with the minority and more services and with the non-food products, Aldi and Lidde, the Supermarcquet’s chain of sales appears to be a large, organized store in many parts.
Cinsbury has placed hundreds of stores on the Argoan exits, and has introduced the two chains two years ago, which have enhanced the sale of the Grosser and have made it more profitable.
The former Supermarcque has failed to renovate a large store with a wide variety of rooms of beauty and medicine.
In the early 2000s, Cinsbury tried to start with Booths, but it ended with a disagreement as to how to divide income from consumer stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Censbury 281-Chort sold the house three years ago to Selecio, the owner of the Leloyd House of Medicine, in addition to the company's office in Selecio.
According to Lloyd Larouse-Possi and Vincin, a cosmopolitan park contributes to the plan by adding brands in a wide range of four columns, including such products as Vincin.
“We have changed our appearance and feelings in order to raise our customers, ” said the director of the Censbury business, Paul Mills-Hex.
We have also placed material information on well-trained colleagues who are ready to give advice.
The types of brands we have are designed to fit every need, and the environment and the conveniences that we have, in effect, indicate that we are now a powerful way of life that challenges the likes of the past.”
Peter Jones was 'betting' after the Hooli Willogby 11 million agreement.
To focus on her new contract with Marx and Spinser and Itvi, Dragens' star Peter Jones of TV gave her a 'em' 11 million deal.
Wilogby has no time for furniture and switches, Brand Trulley.
The couple's business was linked to Gowenez Paltrow's Gop Brand.
The 37-year-old woman of Theis Morning announced in Instagram that she was dating.
To focus on her new contract with Marx and Spenser and Ytiv, Holly Willogby spent the last minute out of their profitable business brand brand and provoked Dragens de Astrologne Peter Jones.
According to sources, at a stressful meeting in Marlow, the capital of the state, Bekinghamshier, the golden man’s new life would be worth up to 1.5 million and she would no longer use Brand Trulley’s furniture and switches for them.
The business was linked to Gowenez Paltrow's Gop Brand, and Willogbein's estimated 11 million dollars had doubled.
When 37-year-old Willogby announced her release in Instagram Truline, Jones went from Britain to a vacation home.
According to one source, "Truly Holly was one of her priorities.
For the next ten years, it was her long-term job.
The decision to leave has in a very positive way alarmed all involved.
Everyone could not believe it was Tuesday, and it was very close to starting.
The warehouse at the main office in the city of Marlo is full of goods ready for sale.
One of Britain's most famous bank star experts, the morning broadcaster, expressed his belief that the release of this person would cost him millions of dollars and that it would lead to a delay in his ongoing successful journey.
As a result, the long-term partnership could end.
Soust's mother, Willogye, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have a bond with John and his wife, Tara.
Willogie strengthened her relationship with Cap even more in 2016, and John, aged 52, was chairman in the month of Marsh.
The Caples Holdy Tüggezer and Jones have a 40-per-cent share in the Bald Win TV project.
Willoogy is going to be an ambassador for M.S. Brand, and this will be an I.T.V.I.M.A.
Close sources told Johns that he did not want to “give any opinion about him” yesterday.
Surprisingly, after a discussion, both of us fell in love.
In some places he laughed at the criticism from the news media about "expected by the president" and the positive remarks about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so active?
"This is the new news reader's voice," Trump laughed.
“I don't give up anything.”
As he noted, Kim was happy at the second meeting, and this was the best way to make the first convention in the month, June, in Singapore, which was held in northern Korea, with the name of Trump.
However, it has been agreed to a non-Niculare agreement.
The North Korean senior diplomat, Ri Ng Ho, spoke with various world leaders at the United Nations Conference, which took place three months after the convention in June in Singapore, the whole of the North American countries did not pay attention to the “corresponding” lack of weapons in North Korea.
As he pointed out, America has continued to hide in order to make us dependent on us.
Trump said good things about his long speech.
They said that we are getting along well with North Korea.
With North Korea, we had previously been leading to war.
Millions of people could have disappeared.
We now have good relations.
According to him, with their efforts to improve their relationship with Kim, they have had a positive effect, and this will not be the case, including the maintenance of rockets.
They said that they disagree when asked if they had an unusual relationship with Kim.
Trump said that it would be easier to be president than to bring 10 thousand people into the man-made hall, and now they're pointing to those who are in front of them, saying that there are about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people died in tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia.
Following the earthquake of the Lum Book, non-governmental organizations in foreign countries were declared to be in need of assistance.
Although about 10 per cent of the Luxemburg population has been displaced, no national disaster has been reported.
As Mr. Sambang stated, “it is not seen that there are so many opportunities to ask for international aid, and this is very difficult.”
When Svem the Children was preparing a group to travel to Palau, it was uncertain that there was a chance for foreign professionals to enter and establish it.
Mi/r Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, stated that Indonesia’s authorities in Palau were checking whether there was a chance that the Allies could be established in the area.
Just as Indonesia is at different times, it is a tragedy for this earthquake.
Although tents are very poor following the tsunami in Hih, on other shores there are very few.
The fact that there was no contact with the tsunami warning, although it did not produce much, played an important role in the death of people.
Moving from one island to another in Indonesia was not easy, even when it was safe.
Natural disasters take more account of Logistic.
The boat in the hospital was on its way to assist the victims in Palau, but it would take it at least three days to get to Palau.
President Jacob Widodo promised to work to improve the development of Indonesia during the election process, and they spent a lot of money on road and rail traffic.
However, the lack of dedicated individuals has threatened to hinder the administration of M/R Jacon in the next year's election.
M/R. Joko is also under pressure, and a growing number of Muslims are becoming traditionalists.
In the struggle against the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed, 10,000 were released from their ranks, and more were used to fight like gangs, bows, and other weapons.

It has been a good memory of the history of the Cromwell Parliament.
The aim is to see that many cultural and religious gifts from the English are not appropriate and that the Taliban have been praised and given to the Persians.
The Crom Well society describes the circumstantial account as a fool and an attempt to re-write history.
According to John Gold Smith of the Crom Well Society, the present debate shows an image of Oliver Komwell, standing outside the Westminster court.
The British Civil War, which many do not accept, was neither marked by Cromwell nor organized.
Crom Well's weakness can be considered to be the cost of the works of Thomas that preceded him.
The way Sarah William Ham Cromwell described the 19th-century mathematics and history shows that many still celebrate it.
M/R. Gold Smith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by blessed men, especially in the 19th century, with extraneous pressures coming from Parliament, especially from the royal family.
The fact that the case has been settled in full is still a historic debate.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century was the shape of our country's continuing development, and Cromwell is a well-known figure of that division.
The achievements are respected and remembered as a king in the throne.
The killer was injured by a Chinese horse that had been killed in the past.
According to the local media, in a market in south-west China, a farmer was attacked by a horseman.
In southern China, Morning Post reported that Yuan, a man in Lupanshui, the state of Guishu, was bloodied and found dead.
In the province of Zheng Kingye, China, on May 30, 2005, the bow owner was ready to fight the foot-and-mouth vaccine.
Last Friday, he and his cousin turned 15 pigs from Yuan State into a market.
The following morning, his cousin died, and his neighbor's house door was opened.
As he said, the big pig was bloodied to his mouth.
According to the report, the Forensic investigation confirmed that the 550 pounds of pigs had been the cause of the death of the Aarzo Union.
My cousin Agur was bloodied and damaged by blood, called the victim 'w', as revealed by Gulling Evaning News.
Yuan Hammus showed that he was entering the market to feed the pigs by the rest of the safety cameras.
The body was found after an hour.
The man killed the animal because it was not Yuan's or cousin's.
According to a police Halavi Levening News, he was found to have been kept safe from harming others, and the police added that he was gathering information.
Yuan's families and market leaders are talking about a good rate of compensation for the deceased.
Even at times, cases of human attacks by pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously damaged the man.
About 10 years ago, a 650 pounds pig attached to the tractor until its owner threatened to drive the animal away.
In 2012 a horrigon farmer ate the pigs, and as one mannotobab farmer said to the SBC News, pigs are not usually violent but may be "stirring up" blood.
"It's their play.
They're like a baby, they ask a lot... they don't want to hurt him.
They just need to give him the right respect, they say.
The remains of a rosa storm cause massive and heavy rains to the southwest of U.S.A.
As foretold, a rhubarb storm in northern Mexico is driving a cold border.
In the days that follow, however, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and south-west U.S.A.
As of 5 a.m., Rosa had 85 miles an hour wind, 1 a hurricane, and 385 a day in the east, and from the southwest of Mexico, Punta Eugena 385 a.m.
On Sunday Rosa is expected to travel north.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean, we are beginning to form a fragment and to travel to the east bound of U.S.A. On Monday as a tropical storm approaching Beja California, Rosa is heading north towards the south-west of U.S.A.
On Monday, Rosa brings rain from 10 in a section of Mexico.
Then, in the following days, when the tropical moisture is in contact with the flooding, it will cause heavy rains in the south-west.
In the area, 1 to 4 inch rains can cause dangerous floods, floods, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona, results in an estimated 2 to 3 inch per hour.
In particular, the region of Arizona is expected to rain between 2 and 4 in particular.
It is possible that a flood of floods may occur with a rapid decline in the rainy nature of the tropical rain.
It is not too smart to walk into the desert when the rain is threatened.
Strong rain valleys make powerful rivers, bringing thundery winds and dust bells in the area.
The ongoing comeback brings some local rain on the southern coast of California.
More than half of India's total rain can create a low level of rainfall and antagonism.
This is probably the first rainy season.

Over 20 million people have seen the trial of British Kavanah.
More than 20 million people have seen the High Court of Hamusa's High Court witness in Sex Networks to the woman who accused of sexual assault by the British Kavanak and the woman who was accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political opposition continues, and for the last four minutes, the red tape has been interrupted by the FIBI agreement to carry out a week's examination of the charges.
Ford said that she was 100 percent sure that she had been drinking and trying to remove her clothes at a high school party for the Women's Justice Committee.
Kavanah claimed that hundreds of percent were certain that they had not been told that they had been told how they were emotionally.
According to the report, on Friday he may have seen more than 20.4 million people.
The company accounted for the number of viewers on average by CBS, ABC, EN, CNN, Fux News Channel, and Fux Business Network and EMS.
The number of other networks they showed, including PIBS, C-SPEAN and Fux Business Network, was not immediately found.
And Nilson often has a problem with measuring those who see him as an office.
To put that into a certain perspective, the audience has a level similar to that of a football game or a academic prize.
Nilson said that the average audiences had conducted all networks on 5.69 million a day in the trial, which strongly supported the Kavanak's appointment.
ABC was a second sight on 3.26 million.
CBS 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the trial, he continued to have the highest interest.
Felix was a central figure in the Saturday drama.
On Friday morning, the National Guard's office issued a statement that it would support Kavanak, and when they tried to force them to go to the Justice Committee, they were filmed by opposers on Friday morning by the CEN and the SBCs.
In the event of opposition, it was transmitted directly to the CEN that they had stood on the ground for several minutes.
One woman said, “I am standing in front of you ”
Do they think that they are telling the truth to the country?
"Many women have no power, but you have power."
According to Fleck, the office issued a statement and could speak more during the Committee's trial before it was closed.
When the Justice Committee voted to vote for the full election of Kavanak, all the Kable and Broadcast Networks gave direct distribution coverage.
However, Fleck said that this could only be done by understanding that he would see the accusation against the candidate the following week, as was the case with a few democracys when he was being pressured.
Fleck, after having talked with his friend Democratique Cristre Chris Kons, admitted in part.
After talking to Knus and many of the secretaries, Fleck made their decision.
Frank's choice is powerful, since the Republics will probably not have a vote to vote for Kavanak outside the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on Kavanah's counts.
British Prime Minister May Heyasian is accused of ‘playing politics’ above Brizie.

One of the nine Catholic presidents in the Pre-trial Court Court's trial last year announced that the following year, Uriah Huanquéras would compete in the European Parliament.

The Dolly flock has forced Gary Holtz to become the second level of the Hiberian club.
In Premiership, the leaders of Harts will meet the next Sunday without winning a game outside the field.
Previously, Ringer has been hosting in Europe Lig in the field of Rapid Venana.
Levin Stone continued to make progress in six games, following his former coach, Kenny Miller, under the leadership of the Chief Trainer Holt.
Living Stone failed to take advantage of his game with a group of guests.
The Holtz group must expand their distinctions, using the Ringers' problem without getting caught up.
Scott Robinson is turning his face towards Gaul, and Allan Litgao is trying only to get a comfortable top-up ball from Carig Heckets.
The concern of the street group is that there is a chance that the host group will be disturbed, as if the Ringers were playing with them.
The role of art is not limited to the decision-making team.
When the Ringers received a fine penalty, Living Stone joined Declan Gallager and Robinson together, and in turn turned the menga ball from the ground to the stage.
Although the Ringers were often under the control of a ball, they were able to protect themselves, and the security of the target was greater than the stability of Leem Kelli.
Although the situation continued, Alfredo Morillos used Heil on Kelly.
Scott Pitman was in trouble with the Ringers' goal, while Allan McGreger and Ligawa were in conflict with the players of Living Stone.
When Livingston's restaurant was repeatedly violated and easily invaded, and the Haschets, which replaced Glen Middton, had a two-pronged risk of being replaced by a double sentence, especially one in the hands.
'Thematic' was interesting when the Livingston game was played.

Livingstone’s Systemic Qualifications and Results
It is a great wonder that mankind’s prosthetics have made every effort to keep it alive.
Especially after they came to the leadership, their way of playing and their activity did not change much, but the team's urge to wake up that group is highly appreciated.
He's got a lot of heros.
The fortress was huge, especially when he organized the shelter room, and in other ways we tested Manga Conner Goldson and Joy Werlin.
The Ringers were motivated by the games.
Although they were good at the time they were under the command of Zarad, in view of the status quo, they had a low degree of success.
The fact that their final ball is having trouble, that the pressure is not effective after it has gone, makes it up to the middle of the board to think about the group.
Ordogan had a special welcome in Koly.
On Saturday, in Berlin, the Turkish and German leaders attended breakfast (sudden 29) and were delighted to see a clear sky.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to strengthen their relationship with NATO has now reached the last day.
They also advised on human rights, freedom of the press, to bring the mother to the European Union.
Ordogan has come to Collen to graduate a great run.
The city is home to many Turkish people outside Turkey.
On the contrary, a number of president’s president’s elite leaders have turned to the police for reasons why he has banned 25,000 powerful fighters.
Hundreds of Ardogan's opponents heard their voices, including the Kurdish, when they protested that Erdogan's policies had been condemned and that Germany had decided to accept the man.
Strong opposition shows that there is a difference between visitors who are German-Turkish citizens and who are accused of being a tyrant.

According to one official Sunday report, Sulawesi, one of the islands of Indonesia, was hit by a tsunami, and the sealine was hit by a massive storm, and at least 384 people were killed and given up.
In the city of Palau on Wednesday, hundreds of people crashed at a festival on the beach, killing and destroying thousands of people, including those who had seen the sun set at the end of a six-foot, or 18-foot - high wave.
The local tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"At the time of the tsunami threat, the ravages were in the middle of their normal activities on the beach, and they didn't try to run away.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the ground, "This was not the only tsunami that was walking 800 km an hour (497 miles an hour) on the ocean Ocean before it hit.
A few people have been able to climb a tree and survive the tsunami, as he said:
About 16,700 people have been taken to 24 stations in Palau.

As Nagojo points out, the destruction was “wide, ” and thousands of rented homes, hospitals, and stores were destroyed:
According to the report, the remains of the remains of the dead have been found, including 540 people injured and 29 people destroyed.
As Nugrejo said, in the north of Palau, 300 km (190 miles) from the coast of Donggala, the place could be about half the size of the earthquake.
Since communication devices are out of work, no visual information can be transmitted from the Donggala area, says Nugoho2.]

He said, "This is a sad old man, but it can be even more so."
The Egensian tsunami was dismissed for not providing information, but although the authorities had warned it, the waves had already arrived.

"Many homes have told me they're out of use," she said.
It's very bad.
When aid workers were about to start their stay, some highly experienced foreign citizens were also complained that they were not allowed to travel to Palau.
On the basis of the Indonesian law, foreign aid could be brought only after the national disaster was announced.
This has not yet been done.
"It is now known as a state disaster," said Iulia Ariani of Indonesia, spokesperson for the Red Cross.
“If the government has demonstrated that it has declared a national disaster, we will almost open ourselves, but nothing has been said about it.”

The Mexican emelio promised not to use public heat
The elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that in his 50-year-old speech on the violent attack on students, the same would not be done in the war.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador said in the Tatelolco court that “they do not use war force in an effort to combat Mexican citizens.”
In that same square, on October 2, 1968, about 300 people were shot dead in the peaceful conflict when the left politics began to take root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by supporting their education in a month-long university and by opening up more free public universities.
The lack of employment and educational institutions also says that young people are leading to organized crime.
The U.S. Agency Intelligence must double its financial support to the U.S. Army
Since China is strengthening its participation in the Arethefisal Intelligence, America has to assign double the amount of money it has now spent on research and research, telling Google, Microsoft and Apple companies of Invester and Arteficial Intelligence Ka-fu Lee
The comment was followed by a number of U.S. government advertising, and the country was also known as the Arctic Intelligence Strategy.
However, China has announced its past deaths in 2030 to be in the arteficiary intelligence field.1.
While double growing up in other countries can be a good start, we are working to bring about positive change, "as they say 2]
In an interview this week with L.B.C.A., L.B.A. said that double the financial support would make the next step into America.
The book of Lee's Arteficiary Intelligence Superpower, China, silicon Valley New World Order, published by Hogton Mifflin Harcort, one of China's leading executives of the Cinovation Ventures Company.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melan University, he built the highly developed Arctic Intelligence System in America, and he continued to serve as an operator of the China branch microsoft study and research.
The former U.S. government, according to Lee, asks when similar races can be used to identify a future generation, such as the European Agency’s initiative to participate in robotic competitions
The U.S. authorities have pointed out that they must work hard to win the government’s budget:
"It's not China, and it's taking the corporate leaders, the companies," he said.
Pes Book, Google, and Microsoft have taken students with long hopes to work on arteficiary intelligence.
According to Lee, the change of the refugee police has given China a high profile of the artifical intelligence efforts.
"I think Green Card should be prepared for students working in the A.P.I.I.D.
China's State Council launched the program in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Centre provides financial support to the institutions of education, which is like the National Science Foundation and the State Foundations, as they allocate money to researchers in America, although the quality of Chinese educational work is low, says he.
At the beginning of this attack, the American Department of Defence established the Joint Agency of Environmental Intelligence, which allows industry and the educational sector to participate, and White House has likewise promoted the establishment of a special committee for Aretheficient Intelligence.
And in this month, the DEAE has announced $2 billion for the project, which is called the International Intelligence Network.
In the study and research of the arteficiary intelligence, the NSA makes up more than $100 million in investment.
In the meantime, the American Act on the Establishment of the National Security Commission has not registered any activity in this month.
Macedonians voted on whether the name of the country changed or continued
Last Sunday, the Macedonians voted to decide whether the country would be called the Republic of North Macedonia or not, which is believed to be the country's remaining member of the European Union and NATO and its marriage to the Greek people.
Similarly, Greece, which has a province called Mekionia, has denied its right to raise its voice so that it does not belong to the Council of Europe or NATO.
Although the two countries signed this name in June, they have been opposed by national opponents to the fact that it undermines the identity of the people of many Macedonian Slavic.
When President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the Refrandum, a similar campaign, the public decided that 50 percent of the population would be required to come out of the debate:
The question on the voice paper reads: “They would like to stop marrying Greece and choose to become a member of the Union of NATO and of the European Union.”
The supporters of the changed name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that it is worth being paid to become a member of the future member of the Government of Yugoslavia of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
"I have come here today to choose what is best for my country, and especially young people in Macedonia live freely under the shadow of the European Union, because this makes us all live a comfortable life," said 79-year-old Olivera Giojevaska in Skipji.
Although not prohibited by the law, a large number of members of Parliament have stated that they will be subject to the voice given and will accept it as vital.
For the name to be applied, a vote must be obtained by two thirds of Parliament.
The country's Electoral Commission stated that there was no problem with the choice at 1 p.m.
The parliamentary election was held in 16 percent, and last year 34 percent opposed, but in this election, 66 percent voted.
"I came to vote because of my children; my home is Europe," said 62-year-old José Tanshiski in the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaiv of Macedonia, their husband, and their son, Dushko, voted at the Refrandm in September of 30th, 2018, which helped to bring the Nethon and the European Union together.
In Skopje, it was observed that 54-year-old Vladmir Kavardarkov had set up a small platform and had the seats placed in front of the tent with those who were moving against the Refrandum in front of the parliament.
"We are with the NATO and the European Union, but when we join together, we are not trying to use our necks to the lowest, but to the detriment of others, ” says Kovadakov.
"We are poor, but in honor."
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we will turn our faces to China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian Union. ”
According to the Prime Minister Zayev, being a member of the State of the NATO brings many investment opportunities to Macedonia, where the number of unemployed is more than 20 percent.
“ I believe that more than 80 percent of our citizens will support Europe’s trade and NATO, ” said Jaeve after voting.
As he says, "Yes" is a confirmation of the next time"
In a recent study published by the Police Research Institute of Macedonia on Monday, a public opinion confirmed that 30 to 43 per cent of the voters were involved in a redundande, and that this was even lower than the number of voters.
Another public survey carried out by the Macedonian public on television found that 57 per cent of the participants were ready to vote on the next Sunday.
70 percent of those asked said they would vote “Yes”.
To be successful, one response must have a single vote when 50 percent is added.
The fall of the Refrando is a reflection of the first failure of the Western government and its policy of employment in May last year.

Then he welcomed Leroy Sanne on the left wing.

As Trump continues, "See this fear-of-the-disaster group of democracy, consider what is happening.
In addition, they are trying to gain power by using every option they can.
“They don't have to be hurt until they get power in their hands. They want to take power and control, and we don't give it to them.”

"As the Notingham East Leber meeting was held last Friday, "we want it to be attended and produced."
After I had spent eight years in Leber MP, I was the best at the G.C. Friday evening meeting.
Sadly, it may not be the voice of many meetings today, and it has been a long time since the rise of "good people, young people" and politics, unless it may be new.
There has been an increase in the unwelcome distribution of special ideas in the Labour Party, and only if the party's presidents accept them.
This began after Germany's leadership, and I had thought that when I was with him, I would be able to take power by virtue of national security or even the European Union's single market, with the support and support of the so-called political views.
What I say when I speak to the public is not a problem; it's a problem, and it's a misinformed social media that protests politics and that I don't have to stay in the Labour Party.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe that I am better than my friends, because the opinions that come to me are political.

This is what I have seen in the Labour Party and others: I am proud to be able to serve with us, and I am also proud to be able to promise, no matter what threats or political comfort I may make to your needs and to make you believe.

Air 38 - 17 millimeter: Unswrought Aar
The two delaying are nearing completion, but there is no doubt that Aar will finish the Premiership race of his skill.
By not winning a ten game, they are running the board one.
Finally, the strong defense department and the players have helped them to win the field with good opportunities.
"We've been tested in many games, and we've never won a game, and that's what I'm happy about."
“Thanks to Ayr, but they created better opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt was replaced by Fraser Kilim and made Airn leader, but the white cards given to the Scotland Ambol Rory Hugues gave the Waryers the advantage and created a need for Melars to move better and Jason B.
To complete the middle of the game, the Aarne's goal confirmed that he was to be punished, and, in all, by his continued efforts, he was able to count an additional target on 17-5.
Melorus II started well in the middle of the second half, and Patrick Anderson replaced it with a vacuum of only five.

The current star ford Karen is planning to move to the hospital engineering scene, after which it is named the director of the licentious restaurants company.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis played his job in the famous BBC Shou, which he wrote and wrote on the main characters and long-term friend Greghimper.

'The sea is ours', the government hopes that Bolivia, without the sea door, will open the way to the Pacific.
Shipmen took over a ship carrying various machines in the capital city of Lappap.
The public buildings have raised a blue flag.
Since Tikako Heikh, the main Amazon leader has been shown to write: "The nature of the law is ours.
"Recovery is ours."
The memories of the 19th century of the 19th century, which has been marked by the bloodshed of Bolivia, are still fond of taking the Pacific Ocean by Chile.
These hopes were high in Bolivia, October 1, after the relief of the International Court of Justice after the death of the Court of Justice in five years.
“Bolivia must see the conflict in a strong, united and uncomplicated spirit, ” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
He will see the ICJ decision of many Bolivian citizens in the country, hoping that Chile will determine the state of Bolivia as the sovereign of the sea.
The decision of Monday, President Eva Maralez of Bolivia, will not be a relief to Bolivia's successful, re-selection of those who are approved and dead.
“We are very close to the Pacific Ocean,” said August last.
However, some Analyses have changed from what they did to their belief that the Court's decision does not condemn Bolivia.
The United Nations, which has made its seat in the Netherlands, has no authority to determine the Chilean border; it also has no authority to determine the outcome of possible talks.
“The fact that the case is not a matter of concern” is known to the Court of Justice of the United Nations six months after the second second debate was heard.
For the past four years, the cause of Bolivia's list may have caused us to go back.
“The issue of access to the sea is banned by the Bolivian administration.”
The morale said that the decision would protect the honour of the Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile seem to have a hard time talking about Hohana's time.
Since 1962, two nations have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Rodriguez Waltz, representing Bolivia, said that the Court's decision was unusual.
“Bolivia will open up a new line of communication with Chile and continue to work on both countries for the past 139 years.”
Calzadilla said that Morales, one of the most prominent Latin American presidents, is using them to create political heat in the matter of the sea.
“Bolivia continues to use its legal right to use the Pacific Ocean”.
“The decision is a good opportunity to resolve the past”
America says that it is unthinkable to stop the Niculer in North Korea unless we can believe it
According to the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho, the country will not destroy weapons unless it is first built up in America.
Last Saturday's talk was given at the United Nations General Assembly.
In Singapore, the major leaders of the countries must keep their word in accordance with the promise made by the Council of Great Countries.
His comments have come to the fore: after a discussion with the North Korean leader Kim John Un, the United Nations Secretary-General in Singapore, he is trying to start a new nuclear diploma, which is now forgotten.
According to Ray, the continuation of the term 'dignity' and the declaration of the end of the two Korean wars does not mean that North Korea will not accept North Korea.
The United States is in doubt when the Pyongyang agreement does not reduce weapons in a meaningful way.
Both Kim and American President Trump want a second discussion.
Pyongyang is not expected to make a tool to protect her safety, which has caused her much suspicion.
Pope planned to visit Pyongyang the next month and set up a second round of Kim and Trump.

John Edward: Language skills are useful to international citizens.
In 2018, private schools in Scotland were able to record the highest grades of school achievement because of the hard work of individuals and groups in sports, art, music and other societies.
In the Scotland Community of Independent Schools, where more than 30,000 students are attending schools, the schools have tried to offer students and parents a very good service.
The private schools are working with the aim of helping their students to pursue a career and a career that they have chosen as citizens.
According to a school curriculum and practice expert, modern languages have become popular subjects in their schools.
According to Nelson Mandela, "let him be able to understand at the time he speaks to the language speaker.
At the time you talk to the language speaker, let him have one mind."
It should be noted with great interest that we should not be founded solely on English to establish relations with other peoples and to build faith.
In private schools, the results of this year are high on the basis of the Belgian calendar.
About 68 percent of the students brought a higher level in foreign languages, namely, A.
Data gathered from the SCIS and collected by 74 school members show that 72 percent recorded the highest output, 69 percent French, and 63 percent Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland believe that foreign languages are useful for children and young people's future.
It now teaches in private school systems and others, such as STEM subjects (Science, technology, engineering and physics).
The study found that 17 per cent of employees had difficulty filling job advertisements, according to a survey carried out by the Commission on the wall and skills of the labour force in UK.
Therefore, many young people and language skills are very useful for their future careers.
In the secular world, language skills are useful for most job opportunities.
Not from the point of view of the person's employment, but from the point of view of his choice of employment, the second language will have equal benefits for his or her age.
People who speak many languages to communicate directly with foreign nationals win the race.
According to Ugove in 2013, when more than 4,000 young people were involved in the election, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak the languages of foreign countries to communicate with others, and France was the only language spoken in two percent (15 per cent).
This is why spending money on teaching the language of children is very important.
Learning many languages, especially for those whose economy is growing, gives children a more meaningful share of work.
In Scotland, differences are observed in the languages each school teaches.
A number of schools teach in a more modern language, while others, such as Mandarin or Japan, think that the United Kingdom language will be very useful after 2020.
Whatever your child’s wishes are, the chances of choosing the languages he or she wants to learn in private schools are also met with the help of experts who have made the Spesalized.
Scotland's private schools are determined to create an education environment that will allow children to succeed in the future and to become the master of skills.
The world's Business Area, language is very useful for countries' futures, and it should not be forgotten that it should be included in school at this time.
Indeed, modern languages should pay attention to “international skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scotlandians wealth and excellence.
The mother-in-law is not a fair.

Ryder 2018 The Tim American Show offers a life - giving hunch to play between singles on Sundays
After a three-sided competition, it seems that after Saturday, the four-man competition would have to be included in this Ryder bowl.

Aeropas has a better advantage, leaving for the tenth game
The Americans, like Spain, feel that they have a very limited chance of being strengthened, although they have a high chance of being strengthened, especially those who play together all day long, such as Spain and Justin Thomas, each of which claims to have four thirds of them.
Spain is a killer, and it is an example leading from Titus to Green.
As his circle increased, these cries of joy increased, and he and Thomas were reduced by two after the second, using crucial and effective speculations.
The rhyme that won the 15th game is equally impressive, and this is a sight that convinces you that the American party is not out of competition.
"You should really examine in depth and worry about your poetry," says Sepevis.
This is the most important thing that every one of us is ignored.

Two and four-year-old games are very exciting to see, and the reasons are to see the partnership between the two, counseling, not consulting, and how it changes immediately.

Auropa led 10.6 to the end of the Ryder bowl

North Korea said that without faith it would never be released by ‘ no ’ war
As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday, the continued lack of confidence with the Americas has been further deepened, and as a result of this, it has been unable to stop its nuclear weapons.
As told by the General Assembly of the International Institute, Jong Ho has taken a positive step in the past, such as the cessation of the nuclear attempt and the collapse of its pilotship and the promise to keep it alive.
"But we didn't get a proper response from America, he said.
“We cannot trust our national security without faith in America, and we cannot put up a war in this situation.”
When Rim offered the same normal North Korean complaint, saying that she was in the process of removing the weapons from the nuclear weapon and that she refused to give up her proper reward to North Korea, it made it seem necessary that Pyongyang did not give up on her democratism in the past.
When Ri, in Kim John U.S. and Trump, commented on the joint statement, this was the first American president and North Korean leader to meet in Singapore, who said that Kim promised to release Korea from the nuclear regime and that Trump would provide security for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to end the 1950-53 war in an official manner, and the U.S.
Washington also protested the call to reduce further the ban on North Korea.
"Americans first called for the destruction of a nuclear weapon, used force to force them into this place, "and otherwise opposed the announcement of an end to war," said Ri.
"It's a dream that can't be used to bring us down, and it's a dream for the deaf people who don't know us."
The problem continues to be deeper in our sense of trust.
For the second time, Rie had a congregation between Kim and Trump, and they had not mentioned anything that had happened to the United Nations leader of the United States.
The minister, in particular, took up three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Mun J.N. in the past five months, adding: “There was no problem in freeing Koreans from the state of Newclair from South Korea.
Although Ri's voice was very different from the past, when they spoke to the cooperative governments, the whole congregation made the goal of North Korea's world, a "Mir's evil president" Trump Kim "The Rocket Man" as a whole.
Trump said last year that they did not threaten to destroy the "complete" North Korea, and then Kim was in the process of resolving the war, but he said that many works would still be fought and that North Korea would have to continue until it was destroyed.
“If it takes two years, three months, or five months, it won't be a problem.”
China and Russia are arguing with the United Nations.
However, according to the United Nations Security Council Council's Secretary-General Mike Pompey, on Thursday, “The Security Council's secret will have to continue to develop the nuclear-weapon process until the outcome of the Security Council's process.”
Since 2006 the Security Council in North Korea has been in the process of discontinuing financial support for the Pyongyang of Nicula and Bastik Misael.
They met with Ryan on the side of the European Union, and according to the whole congregation, they said they would visit Pinjang again the next month to prepare for the second discussion.
This year, Pope Semmeine visited Korea for a third time, but the third did not produce as much as expected.
When they released Pyongyang in July, it was stated that changes were being recorded at different hours.
In this month, North Korea's meetings with Moon revealed that it should take America to “take similar action” to break down its Michael stations and to destroy its name.
According to Kim, "like action", they want security, and Trump said they had entered Singapore to improve their relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learned about getting enough rest.
‘This year, all students at Harvard University have been trained to stop the practice of studying because of sufficient sleep and the use of ‘a lot of coffee’ at night.
It has been said that the world’s number of highly educated students is low in understanding of the basics and how they see themselves.
Charles Esler, a professor of sleep management at Harvard School, and a specialist at Bermingham and the Hospital of Women, as well as at the Women's Hospital, have arranged a course that they believe is unique in America.
Sleep loss has prompted him to start his education training on the impact of education.
'At the end of the day, a woman came to me: 'Why was I now told? Why didn't I tell you in the past?'
When she said that no one told her about the benefits of sleeping, he said he was surprised.
This first-time course, according to the school, will help students to have a good night’s sleep, which will help them to improve their educational and athletic performance and to protect their health in general.
According to Paul Barera, a professor of medical skills at Harvard School and director of university health services, he decided to make the course known to students with severe sleep problems a week after his arrival.
The training that takes time has a lot to do.
In one room, students, with a coffee cup, a screen, coaches, coffee and light, and a lack of sleep, describe a regular observance of nighttime athletic requirements.
In other parts, participants are told that long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart disease, struk, stroke, and cancer.
It encourages participants to think about their skills, including the entry map.
'We know that student behavior doesn't change immediately.
We believe that they have the right to know; they add that you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking.
It is still a culture of meditation that spends the night without sleep: the use of modern technology, as he says, is a growing problem following a growing lack of sleep pressure on students.
Make sure that you get enough sleep with good comfort, and this helps students to stop anxiety, fatigue, and anxiety, which is a secret weapon that reduces weight, sleeplessness, and constant hunger.
19-year-old Califorma, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student, supported Professor Céssler, who shaped the course, and one day last year he entered a classroom at the University of Havard.
He said that he encouraged him to reveal Ainu and to take other courses in the courtyard.
The next day, he hoped that all the students of the Post Graguat would have to follow up on similar programs and complete the training before going to the next competitive institutions.
According to Professor Chesler, students should be aware of the need to go to bed and get up from bed to use a urination, as well as the damage caused by the electronic screen and the blue lights released from LED, which also distorts our heart rate and causes sleep problems.
Living Stone 1-0 Rengers: Menga's goal has discouraged Gerard gangsters.
The Ringers were caught up in a defeat, which led to the attack by Dolly Menga, a group that broke Stephen Gerhard in Livingston.
Since the victory of the 4-1 victory in Sangunston, the Iberoks have tried to register their first victory, but the Garri Holtz team has been weakened by the 18th game, which has ruined its eight-point leadership.
Menga's first half was exhausted seven minutes, and the Ringers played well in the field.
Now, as the Ringers descend to the sixth level, the Living Stones have come up with a goal in Haiti and have risen to the third level.
Another disorder is expected to occur in the Ringers property department, and if the bandits are on the line, Spain has been shot in another direction and injured in the head.
In Betfred's half-completed game, he played eight games outside the competition.
In another way, when Holt was able to win Harts with Levi 11 last week, he was happy to be able to worry about his competitors in all the games.
The Ringers were better controlled by the ball, but Living Stones were also observed doing better with the ball.
Menga's goal in Almachregers must be set in two minutes, following up on Pitman's scotch outside the race, but it can increase its chances.
When you arrived with Craig Helkatet, he tried to get his friend Alan to push him to his goal.
The Ringers were good at controlling the ball, and they had a better hope than their faith in winning a third-party game.
Alfredo Morlos had been in trouble for the first quarter of the week, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian question.
The Ringers tried two rounds in the first half of the year, and former Irish goalist Lem Kelli in Lassa and Colibali were disturbed by shocking attempts by Ove Ijaria.
The 34-minute opening of Levi is against the game of blackout, and no one will deny it.
Rengers are unable to talk to Jacob again.
Scott Arfield gave his ball to Scott Robinson like Declan Galagcher, who was able to count Menga as a star.
1] Gerhard was able to replace Rein Kent with Culibalin, and when he was able to make more influence on this wing, he tried to prevent the amazing failure of Marilos.
But for the stranger group to play a game of beauty that they like to play, the Living Stones must use a lot of ballet and a long - distance ballet.
At Holtz, when the last rounds strengthened their leadership, McGreger Jacob sought to stop before his attack began.
Although Glen Middleton, who was replaced by Rengers, sought a fine to punish Jacob, he was ignored by Thomson.
Almanac’s Creator of Giger
The pages are now taken from the "Sudy Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 ago, today, the number continues to be counted...
Giger created a radio activin method to distinguish and measure, which he developed to a device called the Gigr controller.
Scientists in the "Bels of Corondo" film, 1995 by Gigre, the science backbone, are famous scientists and dell Evans.
“ What is in the world ? ”
Rogers was used by Giger's supervisor to find out where they had radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you listen to your ears, you can hear the impact on the radioactive atomics in the mines.
Evans, "Bel, of course it's going to break up now!"
"Hens" Greg died in 1945, and their 63th birthday was markedly different from the days of the attack.
But the scandal has made his name live.
The new cancer vaccine has created an unusual form of the immune system.
The new cancer vaccine has caused the body to develop an unusual cell and to die.
The vaccine produces host cells, which are the body’s body.
In the laboratory, the method is to release the immune cell from the patient’s disease.
Then it is common to see a protein in many cancers, and it is repeated.
The cancer-related vaccine is showing promising results.
A woman who received the vaccine has been infected with a new fever, and the cancer in Ovarya has disappeared for more than 18 months.
In his technique, the immune cell has been removed from the patient and replaced by a laboratory. The protein is called HER2 and is then placed on the cell.
According to Jay Berzovsky, professor of cancer at the United Nations Institute of Cancer in Marylanda, “the result is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 says that while various types of cancers grow, including breast, ovarry, samba, and bladder cancers are found among these, Professor Berzovsky says.
The idea of taking the Emion cell from the patient and how to track the cancer cell is what is done to treat Licomian.

But as Karen Hunter of Tok Shaw said, West “is a very beautiful person, and this is very beautiful.”

More than 820,000 have been infected by diseases, says health officials.
In 2018, only the second quarter of 2018, there were about 40,000 new hooves.
Most of the new ones have been involved in forced labour, and the past has changed.
In some parts of China, HIV is now the norm by providing the health of people with contaminated blood.
But in this case, the Chinese health official said that the number of HIV-positive people has been reduced to almost zero.
However, more than 100,000 people living with HIV are growing in China.
E.I.V. is a major issue in China's Elgibuti society.
Similarly, in 1997 the crime of Soun Elgibutin, which was convicted of sexual violence in China, has been said to be very high.
Studies suggest that because of traditional culture, 70-90% of males may eventually marry female homosexuals.
Most of the spread of HIV is due to the lack of due diligence in these facts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to implement HIV therapy on a national scale.
Maxie Waters denied Gop Center data and the explosion 'adversity lies' and 'Serra 's theory' workmate'.
America, like myself Maxie Waters on Saturday, accused a colleague of writing down the personal information of the U.S. Secretary of State on the Wikipedia page.
According to the Lusangilata democracy, the "dangerous wings" are glamorous and online, although they are being exploited.
"False lies and many embarrassing lies," as Walter put on her Twitter page.
The U.S. Home and Telephone addresses included the information released by the Center of South Carolina Lindsay, Gerham, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of them.
The information was posted by an unknown person on the Internet in Katitol Hill, a member of the St. panel of the High Court of Justice at the time, who was in charge of sexual misconduct in the city of Artt. Kavanuh.
The break came after the three secretaries asked Kavanuk questions.
According to the report of Gedt Wei Pand and Red State, traditional Web sites are connected to the Waters Office, where the computer's address is linked to the Web site, and Waters's Search Information is released, according to The Hill report.
"This principle is a total lie, Waters," she said.
"My workmate, his identity, personal information and security were damaged by this false and fraudulent accusation, and he was never responsible for this information.
This is a whole lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized, even from the former White House of Presbyterary Ari Fleisscher.
"This is an anger, he wrote, "Fletcher."
“This shows that she has no patience to become a Congress member.
When a person is convicted of his work, he should not be provoked.
They should not be unwilling.
They should not ask what the man's interest is.
They must be calm and peaceable.
Fletcher compares the situation of Waters with that of Democrats, who accused Judge Kavanuk of being very angry at the Thursday meeting.
During the mid-selection period, Omar Navarro, who competes to remove Waters from her seat, heard his voice on Twitter.
"If it's a big truth," he said, "it's a fraud.
According to Waters, her office has changed this fraudulent charge "to the right authorities and law enforcement agencies.
"We are convinced that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all members of our work and for all their destructive and dangerous actions."
Johnny England Strik - the ill - toler of Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to see the need for a new film, but it is also the desire to create a new image in the British and John England's anaesthetic. Previously, it was started in 2003 in Johnny Shaw, England, and it planted the soul in John and England in 2011.
Would the tang in Chik cause us to be shocked by how the new foreign trade in the country’s affairs reflect garbage in an unswerving way?
In any event, Pap Aid's face, a rubber face John England renovated it for the second time, but it shows that the most important thing is in the area of a movie that we do not talk to.
He is, of course, a useless spy, but a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a littleness, and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a glosle, and a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a man's made and a man's on to the character's being of mens being on to the character to the character on to the C's beings beings on to the Cre beings and a topic of mens being to the character.
Atkinson, a secret person first played on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, causing a lot of controversy before it started.
There are one or two good times in this new GE visit.
Johnny England has been very much interested in getting the helicopter on the top of the middle-century helmet and on the top of its head.
Atkinson's funny body gift is being visited, but his relaxation is especially intense, especially when compared with those who are out of control and who are not able to do it.
It seems that the fun is a little more than an adult, and that Johny's confused alarm is seen in the silent Atkinson film on Person and of Ben.
The current topic is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
One of the British secretmen broke into a very strict web site and revealed the identity of British spies on the ground and even shocked the small, important ladder called Kevin Eldon on the job.
For the most proud and unconquerable prime minister, this is the last hard-assist, especially for a person whose political agenda is being lost. Emma Thompson has done everything she can, but nothing is done on this false Teresa May story, but nothing is done on the playbook.
The intelligence consultant told her that each of these jobs has been damaged, so she has to bring a retired person.
That is, John England himself is confused, and he is now the director of a rich school, but his education is about how to be a covert, and some good boxers say that here England has a boarding school like Rock Ainhana.
England was again sent to Whitehol for an urgent statement, where Ben Miller was again contacted by his assistant, who had been in a very difficult situation.
Boh is now married, with a sailor attached to a sailor, a beautiful, hockey dolla, and then a Vicki pedadine.
So all of the queen's strict artwork of Batman and Robin is back on the job, her beautiful sister Fatale O'Fella Buletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the evil hands of Tick Billioner, hoping to solve British computer problems, as shown by the wealthy Jack Lassie Volta.
England and Boeh began their hot journey: Don't catch a French restaurant as a host; they set themselves up on a luxury ship, and they created a problem of escape; and Vertat and the inner part of the Volta house, while Riality tried to use earphones.
For the last series, all stops have come out, but because of their popularity and warmth, the situation is generally a small television.
My beauty is not exaggerating.
And although I cannot stop reading about John’s other films in England, can the British film industry not bring about justice by providing a suitable role for the talent of Rowan Atkins?
It has been said that the thief is planning a five-day payment plan for four days a week.
The German Corbans Liber Party stated that the English are planning to work four days a week, but that the payment would be five days.
It is said that the party would like to spend an extra vacation day to the employees by the company’s executives who have acquired the time savings through the Artifical Intelligence (AI) Revolution.
Employees will see that they use a three-week break, but they will go home with a one-off fee to confirm it.
Sources said that the idea was in line with the party's economic agenda and planned to act in a way that would benefit the country's employees.
The trade union has been approved by the trade union to provide four days of refuge for workers from the changing economy.
It is expected that the long-term source of the Liberian party will be released before the end of the year.
“Not at once, but it is a success promised by the Party to rebalance the work week’s economy in a way that supports the plans of the general industrial leader of the party.”
Green Party will not be the first to present this calculation publicly in view of the fact that it made a promise during the four-day election campaign in 2017.
However, what is promised for success is not currently being fully pursued in the Labour Party.
“It’s not a four-day job policy, and it’s not taking into account the party.”
Shado Chansler John McDonnell, last week's Liberian meeting, used it to explain the vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that the power of "unnamed employers" and "retirers" would be taken over by service companies.
The Chasser’s plans also mean that the current stockholders of water companies are unable to regain their full share because of the fact that the Liberian government’s legal act can make "scatters" because of the legal acts of the Liberian government.
It has confirmed the value of shares from private sector companies, which put employees in corporate bonds, and have added up to 10 percent of the value of shares, up to 5% of the share of profits.
Lidley Graham, John Kennedy, says that his examination of Kavanah's FBI may change his mind for '60 Minnes ' .
Judge Brett Kavanah's trial of the charges against the FBI has delayed the final vote of the Supreme Court, and the findings of the office may have prevented the support of the Republican secretaries.
In an interview held on Sunday, the news representative Scott Pellet asked the Republican secretaries. John Kennedy and Lindsay Gallham found something in the FBI that could change their mind.
Kennedy seemed clearer than his South Carolina friend.
There's Kennedy.
"I was going to hear a witness, and I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanach."
After this, I was arrested, that charge was brought, 'Have you done it'?'
And he was firm in his decision, wherein was no end of every man's will.
However, it seems difficult or impossible to change the voice of the Grimm.
Bryth Kavanak has decided what he will do with it, and he will receive a potential trial for it.
"I don't know what happened, but I know this: Britain's very hard denied, and Christine's added confusion.
And he could not confirm any man that was called by name.
36 is his mother-in-law.
There is nothing new that will not be seen with me.

If you are not allowed to pay a video-based ticket, a series of concerters had to complete a series of activities or “actions”, such as volunteer service, e-mail writing, telephone calls or other meaningful means of stopping poverty.
But how successful is the Global achieved 12 - year - old?
Is it because people think that the desire to see a show is the right way to convince them, or is it because people think that they have made a real difference because they made an online complaint or a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Cityzen has reported that more than 19 million supporters have registered "participants" from its supporters, which is moving him to set various goals.
These actions have prompted the determination of world leaders and have resulted in more than $37 billion in policies that could affect the lives of people in 2030.

The U.K. reported that more than 5,000 actions to improve the diet of mothers and children supported the government's welfare, welfare, and child care project, the Power of Nutrition project for over 5 million mothers and children.
In response, a FAQ website asks, "What did you think we're going to do to end the worst poverty?"
The answer of the world's citizens is, "It's a long and difficult way -- sometimes we go down and fall.
But, like the great human rights and anti-apartite activities before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful than we are.

"Iran and Russia's choice of power-powered resources is, in many cases, reduced, forced and fuel replacement," he said, "a special qualification" that "Russia's power-resources rely solely on fossil fuel.

A group of 18 states and Colombia’s Ministry of Criminals are supporting the new U.S.S. law enforcement policy, which prohibits domestic violence and prevents asylum.
“From 18 States and representatives from the Ministry submitted a court trial document to support an asylum applicant in Washington, Washington, in support of the policy. ”
The full name of the charge in Graiss V. Cecences of American Civil Liberties Union complains that their arguments against the federal policy in August have not been made public.
Her friend, "and the boys of a violent gang member", said that she had been brutally treated, but the U.S. authorities rejected her asylum request in July 20.
And he was bound in Texas.
The women's lawyers in support of Grace described a number of countries as facing ongoing problems, including El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with U.S. asylum applicants.
The new U.S. Security Policy adopted the 2014 Bordo of Emigrant Appils decision, which allowed unannounced refugees to flee from domestic violence and to apply for asylum.
In a statement delivered on Wednesday by the Supreme Prosecutor of Colombia, Carl Ressin called the new policy “a ten-thirds of the state, federal and non-governmental law”.
"Federal law wants all questions of asylum to be settled on the basis of different facts and circumstances, and thus violates the rule of law."
In addition, the lawyers argued that the policy of prohibiting refugees from entering the U.S. economy was a major chance of becoming businessmen, as if they were “necessaryly powerful”.
The Supreme Prosecutor, Jeff Seas, ordered Ján to ensure that victims of domestic violence and organized attacks did not seek refuge.

The U.S. ambassador of China is charged with “threat” advertising.
Just a minute after the U.S. China daily newspaper was released in the U.S.A. World newspaper, a four-page U.S. commercial broadcaster accused U.S.A. Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
After accusing China of interference with the Nov.6 U.S. Congress, President Donald Trump China's denial, former Robbery, who is heavily sold by the Ioa State newspaper de Monne Registerer, was charged with part of China's Daily Congress.
The growing effort to put pressure on China by the U.S. authorities to the Reuters has pointed out that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. choices.
While foreign government advertising is common for developing trade, Beijing and Washington are bound in the non-spoiled trade wars that have now led them to impose circumstantial taxes on one of their imports.
Chinese experts and U.S. specialists said that Chinese anti-dumpings were designed to harm the delegates of the Republican Republican Party, such as Ayoua, who were involved in the early commercial war.
In China, former ruler Terri Brand Beijing, former ruler of the U.S. ambassador and agricultural products to China, said that American workers, farmers, and businesses were affected.
"China is now increasing its threat twice as much as its own free printing of propaganda announcements, ” wrote Brandt in Sundays de Moné Regis.
“To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government is using the free speech and free printing culture of the American press to release advertising on De Moné Registrar, ” writes Brandt.
“As regards the sale of newspapers and magazines on this Beijing street, ” he wrote, “the limited opposition you will find is our limited voice, and the Chinese people have no real reflection of the different economic trends that are in China’s economic crisis, taking into account that the media is under strict control in China’s Communist Party. ”
“He refused to accept his request to print, one of China’s most famous newspapers,” added, “but he did not say which newspaper.
Researchers warn that the Republicans are turning away from female voters because of Kavanah’s failure before reaching the middle of power.
Despite the questions of whether the Supreme Prosecutor of the Supreme Prosecutor, Bret Kavanak, has committed many sexual assaults, the commentators have warned that they will face negative responses, especially from women, during the mid-term election.
The feelings involved are very high, and the majority of the Republics are clearly interested in the sound.
“ We can't turn those things back, ” he said to The Hill Book, professor of political science at the University of Sirakus Maxwell School.
Rycher suspects that the EBI final test is sufficient to reduce angry options.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, or tomorrow they will not forget what,” said national spokesman Karin Jean Pierre Wednesday, according to Washington, D.C.

“Democracy’s deep desire and motivation will be removed from the record, ” said political commentator Stu Rosenberg Lennys City, who is not a member of any political party.

Ford indicated that a statement detailing the charges of sexual assault by the Supreme Prosecutor of the community could be followed by a strong negative reaction from commentators who had previously been authorized by the Republican authorities.
“This is a gyopy problem, ” says Michael Steele at the beginning of the previous week of the National Committee of the Republican Republican.
“Not only about the sound of the committee or the final vote or the Kavanah sitting on the seat, but also about how the Republicans have taken this and have it hosted, ” noted the director of the Prioritis U.S.
However, after the testimony of Ford and Kavanach, the Americans seem to have been divided into two parts, to a lesser extent, into the surgeon.
A new yogov sound process shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony with certainty and that 35 percent believe in Kavanak with certainty.
In addition, 38 percent of Kavanah believed that he was lying when he was giving a witness with certainty or if he was a witness, and only 30 percent and ford.
After pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed in Ford and at least one other case, Diborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, when she witnessed under oath before the Sint Law Translator Committee, she witnessed that Kavanah had attacked her 17-year-old brother in a drunken state.
Ramírez accused the High Prosecutor of exposing the members to her face as they attended the gathering in the 1980s.

The two-time Olympic Nihs Medalist has become a high-ranking LGBT player and uses his face to argue that homosexualism should not be viewed as a crime in Australia’s Commonwealth games.
He spoke out because he wanted to give others "hope" because he felt that he could live openly without--and that he wanted to give it to others.
Soust-time World certainly found a guy in 2013 - US film - after Dustin Lance Black, he said, "I am surprised."
Daly, last year, he married his 20th anniversary, Oscar's great winner, but he never argued about his age.
He said that it was difficult to find someone who had died of cancer at the age of 14 and his father, who had died of cancer at the age of three years.
In May, Robert Ray Black became the parents of a boy named Daley, and Daley said that the "general page" was changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, I'd just like 'gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
The gold of the Olympics is Medalai Robbie."
His father, Robert, has a similar name, as did his 40 - year - old son who died of brain cancer in 2011.
Daley refused to accept that his father would die, and said that he had one of the things he finally asked — that he wanted to be the front line — that he had London 2012 with his ticket.
He said, "I couldn't tell my father that you won't be with us to be the front line."
He said, "I was holding his hand at the time of the break of the breath, and I was sure the breath was no longer good until it stopped and died."
The next day, Daly won the 2010 Olympics, and he won the copper.
"But I know if this was my age, I know it's my age -- playing Olympic games in front of a supportive people, there's no sense of humor," he said.

Mikkelson’s position changed on Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson places a tribute on his 47th - Sunday Ryder Cup, but he has to change his position in order not to place anything unpleasant.
Mikkelson, who is playing the race every two years for honor, was replaced by Jim Furyk on Saturday, a pair of Saturdays.
Rather than being the light of the action, as was the case with the United States, the 5-time mighty once again divided his time and prepared his head for the game to be relieved of his anxiety.
Even those who travel without winning do not arrive at the tower in his day, but it is not suitable for Le Golf’s hard national play field, which is so busy and so easy for a 48-year-old player to get into.
And if the field is not enough to discourage itself, Michaelson, for the ninth game to be held this week, meets the strong British Open to win Francesco Molinari, who joined in the four games this week.
The Americans, who started the 12 down-point games, can testify to the importance of the Mikkelson game if they do not start a major attack.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own person, but he didn't say much more.
“ He fully understands his role today, ” said Furyk, “if he hit my back and put his hand on me, he will be ready tomorrow. ”
"He has deep faith in himself.
He's amazing, he's been adding a lot of things in the past week, and he's caught it this week.
I didn't think that it would add two games, as a chance.
I was thinking so much, but we thought we should go that way.
Like everyone else, this wants to be."
With regard to a lot of Ryder game, the Nick Faldo passed the honor of the Sunday game by Mikkelson.
The Ryder's game can show the end of his time of play, since we never come to the end of his own self-esteem.
Mikkelson fought 18 times, 20 times when he won, but he went back seven times, and he brought some invisible things to the team, says Furyk.
"He's funny, he's naughty, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's making fun of people, and he's great at finding him in the team.
"The young players have had fun playing with him this week, and it's a joy to see him.
"He gives much more than a game."
The European Ambulance Thomas Bjorn knows that a wide range of differences will soon end
The Europe Ambul Thomas Byjorn can be transformed into a journey that is not easy to find when the Ryder game is played alone, just as he has learned from experience.
The first game was played by Valdrama in 1997, at the time, by Seve Balesteros, the five-point tops of the Americans, but finally won the game with a narrow result, 141,132.
"Remember that we have been leading you widely over Valdrama. If we win, we were leading the Brooklyn on a wide scale, and we won the little Valdarmama, ” said Bjorn, who won the 2018 graduates 5-3 Wednesday and yesterday and was led by Le Golf National, after seeing him on his own.
Therefore this story shows that this thing is not done for me, and for all the rest of the company.
Tomorrow thou shalt bring forth thy full strength.
Go up here, and do all the things that are right.
The thing didn't end, until you found your number on the highway.
Alma Allan, that's what he's trying to win, and that's what he's focused on.
I've spoken it all together: I focus on 12 of our players on our side, but we also know that on the most part of the world there are great players.
Byron was pleased with the qualifications of players in the intense golf competition, but he added, "I never used this to benefit myself.
Let the next day have no mercy.
Tomorrow is a personal qualification, and that is a different thing to establish.
When things go well, it's great to be with Agar, but when you're alone, it's like a golf player, it's all right.
That's the message that you're going to take to all the players. Keep your best qualifications tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner alone, go and do so, show the best qualified."
With the exception of Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who found a three-point joint, Jim Furyk expects his players to show him a more personal qualification than the players have worked together.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these big changes, and finally when Europe elevated a "miracle in Medinah" he was a member of a winning group in Brooklyn.
I remember every word, and the reader, Ben Crenshow, in 1999, responding to the question of how to gather players who are moving to the last day.
"We have 12 crucial poems tomorrow, but as you saw in Brooklyn, it's better to remove that fast start, as you saw in Medinah.
It goes one way, and it's just a push on the box.
We've organized our path so well and put the people in the shape we've heard, you know, we're trying to establish magic tomorrow."
Thomas, who was given to try to run his retread, and Roy McLroy, Paul Cassey, Justin Rose, Jon Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter followed in the preceding half of Europe.
"I went this way with this group's grammar because I thought it would cover up to the inside," Byron said in his single choice.
Germany’s new warship was rebuilt
The German Marine Force had to be applied in 2014 to replace the cold warship, which had to be replaced by a warship, but because of the corrupt and rising regulations, it would not continue until the following year, reports the state media.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the new Baden-Werttemberg-Reder shipship's rapid entry into force, until mid to mid-19, a military spokesman, such as Die Zeit Newspaper.
The ship had to combine its sea force in 2004, but the difficult situation of the continent had created a problem in the area of the landline project.
The four Baden-Werttemberg-Practice ships that have ordered the past 2007 sea force will be replaced by the Brenmen-Prime Warships, which have been aged by the four Baden-Werttberg-Piercture ships.
It is known to have a high frequency, anti-air and anti-ship devices, as well as some of the satellite technologies such as small radar, red light bulbs and sound signatures.
Other important events include a long period of repair: the new rapid warship must be able to survive for up to two years from the port of the country.
However, after a series of delays, the German-Germany said that it would be possible for them to be past the start of the service, as Dee Zeit noted.
In the past news of the death of F125 warship, when the German naval authorities prevented him from using the ship to Bloham & Voss supyard in Hamburg.
Now this was the first time that the sea was filled with his power, and brought again the ship that was found by the boat:
The reason for the return is not known, but the German media have mentioned “software and hardware ” that makes it vital if the ship were to sail a warship.
The lack of software was particularly important: Baden-Werttemberg-Specker ships were capable of breaking into 120 ships, and the former Bremen's army had to be semi-powered.
The ship has been found to be unusually difficult, and this has reduced its capacity and has limited its ability to upgrade its marine power.
Some 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be twice as heavy as the vessel used in the Germans in World War II.
On the other hand, the value of the total project is becoming a matter of concern, including the training of sailors.
It has been reported that from its start, €2.2 billion has reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems surrounding the new rapid warship are particularly important along with the warning of a reduction in Germany's marine power.
In the opening of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German Parliamentary Committee, announced that the naval power is indeed "ships suitable for secret".
The authorities said the matter had grown steadily, for old ships had stopped working, but vessels had not been replaced.
No fast warships in Baden-Werttemberg-Budn said with grief that they could not combine their power.
A National Secret Listener on the Secret Life of Every Lots of Birds
A new study is under way in the Skotish subterranean soil, to show how its appearance is used in hunting the land for food.
It is thought that it hates a new light on the unique nature of the birds and commands future security activities.
According to national scientists, scotch study is a common and loud pipistrelelles, as well as Buni, and Daubenton Lilitt, in Inverwe Gardens, Western Ross.
In general, special flags are located around key areas to monitor bird activity.
They use hand-held sensors to conduct NHS workers and volunteer mobile studies.
All sound records confirm that an expert's voice is repeating the call of a bird and what kind of race it is doing.
A map and a report will be prepared to create a description of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist for NTS, hopes that the results will be very important and that some species will be used.
This information helps to determine the benefits of selective forest conservation, such as green-field work and rainbirds and related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the number of recognized birds has fallen dramatically over the past two hundred years.
They are in danger of destruction for the sake of building and development.
They can pose dangers to the wind and lightning, such as flying papers and some building materials, as well as the attack of the rhino cats.
Yes, the birds of the sky don't see it, for they don't see it.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come with their prey for hunting.
They use the strategy of the widow that is complex in order to find insects accurately or to detect obstacles in the way they fly.
NTS takes more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 shields around the beach.
There are ten trained professionals who regularly study, do shelters, and sometimes do rescue work.
The organization established the first and only species of the Lilitov family of Scotland, which is home to eight, even in the Thrave oestate Demfries and Galloway.
The governor of his inheritance, David Thompson, said that his inheritance was a fitting one for them.
"This is a good place for nightbirds," he said.
We have old buildings, many satisfying trees, and all a good livelihood.
But there is much we don't know about the clown birds, so the work we do here and elsewhere helps us to understand more fully what they need to do. ”
He emphasized the need to check the absence of detectable birds before repairing the property, and he could eliminate the damage caused by a parent’s nest that was caused by ignorance, even to 400 women and a child, and perhaps to the general population.
It is a crime to kill, attack, disturb, or tear down the nest.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the guard of the Scotish Ellith bird, encouraged his people to come to help.
As she said, “I know that the number of our species is just right, for we must still learn much about our pets.”
When the lawyer was ready to accuse the German magazine, Ronaldo ignored the charge
Cristiano Ronaldo charged him with “false news, ” using his name,“ People want to make themselves known. ”
The lawyers are ready to charge the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel.

Today, the news lies, "five times in the camera of Ballon d'Or."
They want to make themselves known by using my name.
Normal
They want to be famous by calling me by name, but this is the job force
"I'm a happy man and everyone's good, "with a big smile.
According to Reuters' view, "the so-called "unacceptable haemmet is preparing to charge Ronaldo's lawyers with the charges of Dr Spiegel"
“ The players are bound by a breach of agreement and have recently violated a very serious individual’s right, and they want to compensate for the moral breakdowns they have suffered, ” says counsel Christian Schertz.
The charge was filed in Palms, Hotel Department, and Las Vegas Casino in June 2009
In Nevada Clark County District Court, documents on a file were reported to have led by Ronaldo and Mayorga to the room on her face
From the case, Ronaldo tweeted to tell me that "99 percent" "good man" fell "1 percent"
The documents show that Ronaldo had been involved in sexual relations but had been agreed upon
Mayorga also reported that she had gone with the police and had pictures of her injuries in the hospital but finally agreed to court “for fear of revenge” and “not to be humiliated in front of anyone”
The 34 - year - old woman was so troubled that she wanted to break the contract
At the time of the attack, he was at the top of the finish of the Manchester United Real Madrid, and by this break, Juvé was transferred to the Italian giants by €100 million.
Brexit (British emerging from the European Union); UK may regret forever losing its car
If the Bredit fails to run the world's car properly, the UK can be 'Everlasting', said business office official Greg Clark.
If Toyota UK British had added to the EU disagreement, then the BBC would have been "inconceivable" when the factory had to stop production for Derby.
"We want harmony," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car’s careers may be influenced by the time - limits of the Brexit disagreement
Of the 150,000 cars produced by the company of Toyota's Aures and Avenis, which produced Burnaston in the past, 90% were sent to the rest of the European Union
"In my view, Brittin stops at our factory in April at the end of April," says Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota Administration in Brunston.
Other UK manufacturers have noted the danger of letting EU go of disagreements, which includes Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, while following the Brexitt, he shut down his Oxford small factory for a month
Car manufacturers say that the potential risk of misunderstandings is a potential risk
The Toyota farming line is guided by the "just-in-time" so that vehicle parts are presented every 37 minutes from UK and EU to EU.
If an EU disagreement occurred on April 29, industry said that law could be violated at the border, resulting in delays and shortening of goods
In Derbyshire, the company said that it was impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day’s weight, and production could stop
Concerning her future relationship with the EU, Mr. Clark said that the state court plan “is a proper arrangement to eliminate the search at the border”
"We need consensus." Today's BBC Radio 4 program says, "This is not only the present success, but we should be happy, so we need an agreement that can lead to this."
"We want to maintain the most effective supply chain not only from Toyota but also from other producers."
Toyota was unable to tell how long the production would end, but the increased cost warned that it could reduce the competition of the factory and its job creation.
According to Peter Tsouvlaris, the meeting of the United States Society of 24-year-old Barnaston, who worked for 24-year-old Barnaston: “As soon as these works are gone, they will never return.
The government spokesperson: “We have learned an accurate and miraculous plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein to extend again, he said White House
According to Sunday's Lt White House, Donald Trump’s many benefits with Rod Rosenstein's deputy prosecutor could be extended to another week; the reason for this is the continuing conflict between Bert Kavanaugh and the High Court.
Rosenstein is responsible for Russian intervention, with the help of Trump and the relationship with Russia, and for the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who examines the hypocrisy of the president.
To place Müller's freedom in danger, and not to drive it out, Trump's superior prosecutor expelled the law, the news reached Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, Rosenstein read that when he was talking with Trump, he was reluctant to copy the news and that it was possible to remove the president in his 25th revision account in New York Times.
Rosenstein lied to the report.
But last Monday, White House reported that it was going to be left in the middle.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a Thursday meeting with Trump in New York under the auspices of the United Nations.
Trump Rosenstein said he would "chosen" but the meeting was delayed to remove the potential conflict with members of the Church's law, which was accused of Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasy Ford's sexual assault.
On Wednesday, in view of the Kavanaugh question, Trump ordered a one-week FBI examination, and all members of the Parliament of the Council should participate to delay it.
The director of Trump's information office, Sarah Sanders, was presented on the Fox News.
He asked about Rosenstein for a meeting, and she said, "No, he's not here for this day, maybe this week, there's something going on in the Supreme Court for another week.
But we'll see, and I'll always want to let the media know that there's something new."
Some reporters may test that evidence: Since September 10, the Sanders did not make a positive statement in the White House.
The editor asked Chris Wallace why.
Sunders said that "Saby" did not hate TV reporters, but she said, "I agree with the fact that they're called."
A direct communication between Trump and the media has been made.
Without any confirmation, she added, "We have seen more questions and answers than any previous president."
Statements will live in the future, she said, "If the media has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly questions, that's better than to tell me.
We've been trying so hard, and for the past few weeks you've seen us doing so very well, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, we're one of the members of the press."
Trump always accepts questions when he participates in White House meetings or leaves with large audiences in the public congregation.
There are few congregations in the single press.
This week, the president will be seen in New York, showing some confusion before a meeting of the president and the reporters.
On Brexit, the health spokesman wrote his fear to the EU staff working in Scotland NHS
The health spokesperson wrote to thank the EU members of the work in Scotland NHS and to continue their work with care from the Poor Brexit.
When Jeane Freeman MSP was less than six months old, he sent a letter out of the EU to the UK.
The Scottish government is determined to cover the costs of citizens working for the EU’s Blemmat public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the debate between UK and EU continues, leading to a decision to be taken.
But the U.S. government was in a position to put an end to the arrangement for him who might also be at odds.
And I know that they shall weep for thee, when they shall not rest.
That's why I would like to tell again and again how much contribution I give to each member of his work, to the extent that they have made their citizens aware of it.
From within the EU, and above, colleagues, health service has brought useful experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work and skills of the patient and of the community.
Scotland is your home, and we want it to stay long."

Foreign rulers are charged with high printing when they own UKs
Foreign rulers are charged with high printing duties when they own UKs, and money is used to help homeless people in their new Tory plans
The activity reduces the success of the journey to attract the young Corbin
The increasing obligation will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in UK
To help the homeless, an annual income of up to 120,000 million people is expected to be at home
Foreign rulers have been charged with high printing duties when they own UK property - and they use money to help homeless people, Theresa May today.
It is viewed as an attempt to reduce the success of the journey of young voters by promising to offer homes that are well - equipped and with high incomes.
The increase in the printing obligation will be applied to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in UK, and money will also help to fight to sleep on the government road.
In addition to the current high-cost printing obligation, two years ago it may have been as high as 3 per cent in the second house and in the second house and in the second - second - to the second - toll.
The house’s cash flow is still as high as 120 million.
New houses built at 13 per cent London have been purchased, priced, and for the first time by rulers on the floor of houses.
Because of the large number of foreign rulers who spend most of their time abroad, many rich areas of the country have become “citys of the spirit” in the capital.
The new directive came by Boris Johnson by two weeks, when many young people were forced to have their own home.
They have been held responsible for not accepting high construction facilities and have been responsible for the cost of houses, and have asked May to leave a part in the "dignity of houses" of the British people who have been able to adjust the "dignity of houses".
Mr. Corbyn Iin has been attracted to a series of planned housing improvements, rental control, and the release of "unsolved" housing.
He would give the council great authority to build new houses.
W/ro May says, " last year I used my prime minister to restore British dreams - that life must be better for all generations.
and repairing the broken houses.
Britin will be open to people who want to live, build, and build a new life.
However, it is not true that it is easy to buy a house, like the strong British labormen, people outside the UK, and other state organizations.
For many people the imagination of house ownership has been so far away, and the reality of lying down on the street, which is the glory. ”
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to run Scotland'
“My last wish, ” said Superintendent Jack Ross of Switzerland, is to be a Scottish coach.
The Scot, 42, now League One, at the top of the three-point northern band of thieves, is making the struggle to replant life.
St. Merren was moved this summer to the light stadium by his return to Scotland Premiership.
I would like to play with my country as with a plaything.
"Ross told BBC Scotland's voice of spore.
When I was a child, my father, Scotland, brought me back to Hampden, and he always told me something.
This could happen if I was successful in running a group.
The successors of the Roses include Sinderland Training Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canyon.
His name, originally built from the city of Barnsley and Ipswich, was said to have been a former prince of Alloa Atlantic, who did not cause anxiety in a large group.
"For me success at this time will be said 'Can I return this group to Premier League?'
For the purpose of this group’s structure and presentation, the Premier League, without any doubt, is to be included in the Premier League,” says the report.
"It's not easy to get to work, but it's just that if I can get back to this group, I can't do it."
Ross has been held in Dumbarton as a foster trainer for care and training in Hearts for 15 months, only three in this training job.
He helped to move from the Alloa to the third, and St. Merren from the post of the Aloa to the winning post in the next race.
And Ross said in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academical that they were now very interested in his work.
"I guess it was the right passage, "remember where Aloa was found.
I can hear from my heart that training is a proper fight for me, and I can't help but play.
It seems strange because I've lived a good life, had a reasonable life, and had some reasonable values.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things which you have to do every week past.
Once again, the stress and stress of the job have a sense of rightness to train things.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm working, and all of my adult years have been on my own.

The summer warmer made Britain's wines on the struggle to grow, but put more pressure on the restaurants.
Drinking groups have shown an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but food prices have been less than 4.8 percent, as the numbers have shown
The CJA business adviser who gathered the numbers, Peter Martin said, "The continued solar light and the long - awaited participation of Julali in a long cup of flags means that he followed a similar repetition of events from the previous month of June, the drinking houses were hit more than 2.8 percent of the time the restaurants were hit.
Food business in June thought of 1.8 percent fall in July
Drinking markets and drink houses have shown greater strength than the fallen restaurants.
But those who focus on food, and those who sell it, have been seriously injured, even though they are not as shocking as those who eat at the restaurant.
It seems that men want to drink, and only come out.
The sale of well - kept drinks and alcoholic beverages was 6.6 percent higher for a month, and three times lower than the price of food ”
“ These results will continue as we saw from the end of April.
The effects of weather and social or sports performances remain a major influence when they are thrown into markets outside the home market.
It is not surprising, however, that food groups continue to struggle, but that the drop of 4.8 per cent of sales is also more expensive than the rising cost.
The longest hot summer food business would not have come when it was bad, and the averager heat we spent in August would have given us a few short periods of needed rest.”
T was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the beginning of the process of starting new services, including the sale of alcoholic beverages and restaurants.
The sale of Yuke, the sale of alcohol, and the sale of the food department, the cosmopolitan Pitch Tracker, brought together the total of the ocean information, if 47 billion business groups gather, distribute us, and set up a computer model.

The breast - feeding device, which compares mothers to cows, divides comments on the Internet
The milk - feeding company’s announcement that compares grain to rich cows has divided online viewers
With regard to the beginning of the so-called "new silent breast milk instrument", Elvi announced the creation of a music video that shows the freedom of the new drinking device to mothers.
When four true mothers dance in a single song full of straw, they say, "Yes, but you can't see me" and "If you don't fully understand these are not cows' breasts, then they're my breasts"
The content goes on: "Bring out your beak, pick it up and take it out and feed my babies. Cut it out. Cut it out.
However, advertising published on the Web site of the organization has created a controversy on the Internet.
In 77,000 photos and hundreds of messages, the video receives mixed answers, many grow up in the study of the “sufferings”
"It is a very important decision to use the cows to make them known.
As with us, they should give milk, except that they were stolen within a few days of the birth. ”
Elvi’s breast - feeding is kept in an unknown location in the nursing home (elvi/mother)
Another comment was made: “It is very disturbing for both mother and baby in a way that they can understand.
But why should we not use them to introduce breast milk to mothers who should take care of their babies?"
Another person added: "This is the kind of advertising that has become familiar with his time."
Against the ad, believing that one woman found his single song " very funny"
"I think this is the highest theory.
If I Had Been I Would Have Died
Drinking water made me feel like a cow.
The announcement was a bit unattractive, but I took what I wanted to say.
"This is the best product," he wrote."
Another comment said: “This is a funny announcement focused on mothers who use a drink (often at their workplace or in toilets) and on mothers who feel like cows.
This is not an ad that commends the industry, nor is it a bad ad.”
At the end of the video, the women’s group announced that they had all sold unsuspecting bars and had sold them from their breastbrows, all of which were going to be destroyed.
The theory behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the breast - feeding process say that they feel like cows.
However, Elvi does not have a full voice, lines or tubes, and does not have or realize the mother’s place under the nurse’s belt, gives freedom to move for women, to hold their babies, and to take them out with them.
Anna Balarin, Mosher and Esidi commented: "Elvie is a revolutionist, so he needs to start with courage and anger.
By drawing up a line between women who describe themselves and milk cows, we show that we want to give the breast - feeding process attention to all the wrongs, and we want to show the unbelievable sense of freedom that comes from having a new drink, often in a sense, and in a way that treats it as entertaining and treating it.
Elvi’s drinking place is not the time to start when it has pages on the front.
During the Fashion Week, in London, the mother of two children, using the crop, appeared on the Fashion Show, using the Dizjaner Marta Jakubosky.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved safely to the tent camp at the border of Texas.
While the number of refugee children in prison has reached the peak, monthly abortions have remained unchanged, because, to a limited extent, the Trump Administration has announced bad talks and policies make it more difficult to accept child guarantees.
As is the case, most shelters are refugees themselves who are not registered, and we fear that they will be in danger of staying in the country when they are asked to have a child.
The concern was increased when federal officials in June announced that they could be collaterald and that other family members should make an adjustment and that the information should be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, the chief immigration and customs officer, Matthew Albins Egensi, testified that he had arrested more than a dozen people who had shown themselves to be the only children who had not reached Adam/Hahan.
The Agency has confirmed that 70 percent of those who were later imprisoned have no previous record of crime.
“The 80 per cent of the individuals or members of the family of the allies are also in this country by way of law, and most of them are from the other side of the country.
So we'll keep following the sad individuals, ” said Mr. Albins.
According to Shelter Walkers, in an effort to speed up the process of the children, the authorities have announced new rules requiring them to be brought before the court of law in time for a month, rather than 60 days before, which was a few days before.
Many are about to appeal to the judge of immigration for legal status by means of a video conference, not physically.
Those who are believed to have fulfilled pre-existing conditions are quickly driven out of the country in the light of the threat.
Reports, like Shelter and the center, have been released in recent months, increasing the children’s chances of long prison periods of anxiety or grief, leading to efforts to raise and escape feelings of energy.
Such concerns are said by advocates to be more visible in a remote area, such as Toronto, where a child who struggles for some reason is more likely to be ignored.
By allowing children to prepare emotionally or to leave their friends without enough time to move into the tent city, many added that it can only make matters worse that are fighting.
Let Syria leave the "extreme forces" for Ljus Alchatt, France, and Turkey
By way of speech for the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Molam called for Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, but the country’s war is now eight years old.
Molam, who serves as deputy prime minister, said that his foreign forces are on the ground by way of law, to fight terrorism, and that they are “resolved in the right way”.
He said to the audience: “You must be released and in no circumstances shall you be free.”
Since 2011, in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died, more than millions of people have been displaced from their homes, “The war on terrorism has ended”.
Damascus says that this holy war will continue to be fought until we have cleansed all the kingdoms of Syria of the terrorist groups and of any outside body.
The U.S. State has two Syrian soldiers who train and advise the Syrian Arabs against the two Kurd forces and the president of Besher Al-Asad, about 2000 in Syria.
France has more than 1,000 foot soldiers in the war-torn country.
He said that it would be good for them to return to refugee situations, and he accused “unreasonable fears” of “a few Western countries” that had prompted them not to return.
“We have called upon the international community and human support organizations to set up their means of return, ” he said.
“They are giving political shape to be a human issue”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid until political harmony is established between Asa and his opponents.
Between Russia and Turkey, the local diplomats said that it was a chance to pressure the political talks into a close peace treaty between them, which was signed in Adalib, the most powerful Muslim nation in Russia and Turkey.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement has taken over the massive attack by the Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, the mullam taught him that it had a "right time to end" and his military action expressed the hope that he would make an Ilama, including the “completers of all the lives” who were associated with him.
The Special Envoy, Stéphane de Stéphane de Hismira, hoped that he would soon convene meetings of a new committee, composed of government and opposition governments, in order to reconcile the law of the war to Syria and to pave the way for its choices.
Molam's work has put things in place regarding the participation of my committee in the Syrian government, warning that there should be no interference in “review of the current Constitution”.

The choice of half-time to a well-coordinated half-powered court is like a flood of money.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th saw the huge amount of money, and thanks to the fall of the Congress circuits, I put two seats in a seating band for the first time
This recently reconfigured circuit of Pittsburgh puts his representative Conner Lamb in the race, who won a special election last spring in another circuit.
The Lamp is competing with the People's Republican Keith Roosefus, now the 12th largest circuit of the former Pennsylvania, currently representing the new 17th century.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania announced that the former circuits had changed their boundaries in a way that would benefit the Republicans.
The 17th competition in the New Year's financial competition led to a sudden confrontation between the main party financial support departments, the Democratic Campine Convention (DCD) and the National Republican Camp (ENRC) Committee.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a narrow election in Marsh, the 18th - century Congress circuit of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held in one republic, and President Donald Trump won the circuit in 20 points.

In June 2017, Trump had a warm relationship with Uan Carlos Varela, president of Panama, and he had a hotel in Panama until the Creators expelled the Tranp Management Group.
The Department of Foreign Affairs states that they decided to call American diplomatic commissioners from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama, for the reason that they decided to call them “from now on” because they decided not to give recognition to Taiwan, as described in the beginning of the month.
But in 2017, the punishment was only on El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid for agriculture and economic support, including drug control.
Financial aid, which includes the cost of damages and valid visa limits, would be detrimental to the level of high unemployment and suicide in the Central American country.
As internal meetings show, the authorities of North America and Central America have made more time to monitor the high-level meeting of high-level officials who are focusing on the welfare and economic prosperity of refugees to the United States.
But in mid-September, the above-mentioned administrative authorities made it clear that, if they wanted the meeting to move forward, any thoughts of punishment in El Salvador would be effectively abandoned.
Vice-President Mike Pence, in a way that indicates the indistinct significance of the meeting, has now been elected to speak on the conference scheduled for mid-october.

Federal researchers are asking for a death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack on New York City
The federal prosecutor in New York is asking for a death sentence on Ciefolo Cypov, which has caused the death of 8 people, and has never been punished by a federal criminal offence in Guatemala since 1953.
Sypov, 30, carried out the operation using a rental house car on the lower Manhatán road in October, using a western parking car, and, in addition, drove the Pacific on the road, as well as injured the footmen.

On the basis of the Court's document, both cases will have the ability to pass a death sentence.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court filed the charges of 22-year-old crimes involving Cypov, 8-year-old suicide, and the violation of the law on motor vehicles and the damage to them.
According to the researcher, the attack is “a long-term plan and preparation, ” which describes Sapiov as “very cruel and aggressive.”
The case document states: “Syflulo habiblaevic Cypov of Diego Enrique Enrique, Nicholas Clevs, Hiran Freuchi, Hiran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Demai Pagunco families and friends caused death.”

The Federal Public Prosecutor, David Paton, described the decision “we are very sorry”.

The Saipov panel had already asked the lawyers not to ask for a death penalty.
