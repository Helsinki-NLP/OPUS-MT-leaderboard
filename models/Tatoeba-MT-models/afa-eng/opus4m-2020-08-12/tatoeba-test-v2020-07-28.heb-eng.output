One of the greatest mysteries of life is how a cat decides what his next move is.
I ate the petrol we cooked a few days ago.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom jumped into the frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait downstairs.
Of course she's sick.
The boat has become a revolution.
Maybe we should go and see Tom.
Now come trouble.
Nobody was still awake.
I'll remember you for good.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do your advice.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for noticing.
We waited for you hours until you showed up.
Tom wasn't the only one who got up so early this morning.
The road is too narrow to cross trucks.
We're in trouble.
How many students are there in school?
The feeling is that it's the right thing.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that have lived thousands of years do not exist anymore.
Let's find out.
Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed about all her problems.
Are meals included at the price?
Because the rain ended up on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with an emergency like that.
The temperature fell ten degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She applied for visa.
I thought everything was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting security of spirit.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks hard.
That man is dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the sea language.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep like we can't live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He's living from the hand here.
If you don't hurry up, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I've been sick of it.
It's all up to your decision.
You're thin.
He's stuck in his mind. His arm supports his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my list of tasks.
Be careful not to fall for the knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is a call.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary was wrong.
I always knew Tom was meant to grow up.
It's raining down.
Can you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We've been experiencing one-on-one problems with the macaroni yesterday.
Tom visited Mary in October.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She seems to me a serious, reliable person.
Tom's athletic.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who offered it.
This novel isn't as good as his last novel.
They stayed that way for a while.
That path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
You invite him to come watch the movie.
Tom's been drugged.
You'll know, his parents, they'll let me know.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a common decision about divorce.
Stop bothering me.
Today I'm in a spiritual state.
Not much happens.
We're planning on visiting Mr Smith tomorrow.
He has a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my biggest headache.
Please sit down!
I can't drive the car, I don't have a driver's license.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She played the play.
Tom told me he hasn't seen Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweaty.
Do I have to sell it?
They're calling by handmarks.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That one's hard to read.
I was cold for a week and I haven't recovered yet.
We started walking again right after she recovered.
Is there on the shelf an English-Japann dictionary?
The gun's calling.
We're too few now.
We gotta stay alert.
What's Tom's problem at all?
They were born a child.
Tom seems troubled.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilization is now a threat to nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least six.
I'm sorting out your clue.
It's very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are miserable, too.
What group is your friend included?
We're just gonna stay.
Please sit still.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "soup and soup" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can feel the storm of sacrifice.
How can I ever forgive an orphan?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marv.
Talk to the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound young.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the fall, the years are turning their color and they're breaking.
Tom never accidentally admits, 'cause he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She never met Maria.
That's the other river in its length in Japan.
No one's happy.
I finally don't owe anybody.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in the answer.
He shakes the bike every week.
Don't turn the computer off.
That distance can't be noticed anymore.
She got guidance from her previous doctor and was transferred to another hospital.
I was missing a prote.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only drank some beers.
The man who ran the car is Mr. Jones.
I have to make it to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him get wet.
Go to the next page.
Have you become an angel?
I hope that can happen now.
Materials will be satisfied.
Have I been touched by an open nerve?
There are many spending places in big cities.
First hit is half the battle.
I'm not sure even of that.
I actually saw a ghost.
You recovered from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm on my way.
It's all on the head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably going to get married one day.
Their house was set on fire.
I like this picture.
Get some sleep.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not that he's dead.
She didn't have to answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This method is beneficial and lacking.
He hid the fact that he divorced his wife.
Shut up your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
The greatest love of my life.
Experience is a fruit topic.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing stronger.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's up.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are my books.
I want a guitar like Johnan.
It won't bother us if you take a picture from the outside.
The goal is to dedicate the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about it.
Are you any of the supporters or the opponents of the fall?
Please don't get involved.
Long Time No. C.
Today I won't get e-mail from anyone.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat turned his back on.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom's from Boston.
You want to know how I did this?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope increases themselves a hundred times.
He went into debt.
Tom's out of the way.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking in English?
It's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom's headed his gun to the target.
I believe my friends are growing horns for me.
You better leave.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Don't ask, please.
I'm coming to kill you.
I love the hour between the Arabs.
You should go.
Are you ready to go out?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me here?
Where was Tom thrown into the prison?
I've learned from the best.
Don't be too quick to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't forget me again.
There's to be a protective helmet.
It's Tom's closet.
I'm sure I'm not gonna recommend an end to the job.
You have to try not to forget what time it is.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
Whatever it is for me, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It was raining yesterday.
She got caught with her pants down.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Did you eat breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do this.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges made a decision.
Hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're living in this city.
The sky will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, get this dog's throat.
It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat to match her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday landing in the house.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I don't have any money.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks as much as three liters of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers distorted the news.
Sign this, please.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
Protesting is a dangerous matter.
Tom says he doesn't want to get into this anymore.
White paper.
Drinks are half a price to six.
The sky is bright almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come up with any complaints about it.
Paris is a very young Japanese witch.
This bridge is three times longer than it is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom seems desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
Those who settle their houses along the river.
It was impossible to pull the block.
Today was exciting.
I'm on it.
Just the vital repairs, please.
Salt, please.
Have you decided where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from home.
I ran.
Tom's an accountant.
Raise your left hand.
I doubt his statement.
I think they've encountered some kind of problem.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
Tom's an old hat that he always wears in the rain.
