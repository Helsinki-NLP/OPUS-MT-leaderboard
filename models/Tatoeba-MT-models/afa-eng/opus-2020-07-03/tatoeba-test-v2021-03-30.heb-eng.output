Welcome back.
I'm sure they're talking about what happened.
Will you hand it over?
You want to do it or not?

If something is a good idea or not, it's not a matter of opinion.

I just want to focus on my vision.
I have to find a way to earn a lot of money.
I see you've made a good impression.
Once you've decided to get into a profession, you can't change your mind in a rush.
If I had been in her place, I wouldn't have raised my hands yet.
Tom took it out loud.
It depends on how you deal with it.

What I hate most about him is that he rebels that he had good grades at school even though he didn't learn.
What's the depth?
The rules have to be obeyed.
He's got a big family he's got to earn.
Was it hard?
What's less likely to consider -- a gold or a silver kilogram?
We'll be happy to help.
I'll make sure they get you in custody.
They don't always obey their parents.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Follow him.
Let's see how Tom reacts to this.
The smell is disgusting to me.

We're thinking about a lot of solutions.
To find an answer to that question, I went to the city library.

There's also water in the alhaland.
What's your greatest fear?
You can find it at every book shop.
Tom looks just like his father.
Somehow I knew you'd make it.
I'm upset about Tom's behavior.
Can you tell me how?
Listen to me.
There's something we have to talk about.
I don't like to see animal abuse.
Tom left the house before Mary's funeral ended.
One of the greatest neglects of life is how a cat decides what his next move is.
I ate the zebra we cooked a few days ago.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom jumped to the frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait down.
Of course she's sick.
The boat has become.
Maybe we should go and see Tom.
Now come in trouble.
No one was awake yet.
I'll remember you forever.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do your advice.
Tom bets on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for paying attention.
We've been waiting for you hours until you show up.
Tom wasn't the only one who ever existed this morning.
The road is too narrow to pass trucks.
We're in trouble.
How many students are at school?
The feeling is that it's the right thing to do.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They all deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that have lived thousands of years are no longer present.
Let's ask.
Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Do dinners cost?
Because the rain stopped, he went on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature's down at ten degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She made a request for a visa.
I thought everything was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting safety.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks hard.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the beach.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He lives by hand here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I'm tired of it.
It all depends on your decision.
You're a dancer.
He had thoughts, his hand supported his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my mission list.
Be careful not to fall into the knee.
I gave it to my mother.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll drink my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary was wrong.
I always knew Tom was meant to grow up.
It rained down quietly.
Could you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We've had problems with the talent yesterday.
Tom visited Mary in October 20th.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russian.
It's simpler than it looks.
She seems to me a serious, reliable person.
Tom Atty.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This novel isn't as good as his last novel.
They stayed this way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
Get him to watch the movie.
Tom was blubbered.
I don't care what I want to do. I don't care what I'm doing.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision on the divorce thing.
Stop squeezing me.
Today, I'm in a mood from my client.
Not much going on.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He's got a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my greatest headache.
Please sit down!
I can't drive the car.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She played a play.
Tom told me he hasn't seen Mary all day.
I don't like being alone at the beach.
I never plan anything.
Do you have a map?
Tom was a sweat washer.
Should I sell it?
They're calling by hand marks.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been safe for a week and I haven't dreamed of it yet.
We started going again right after you've recovered.
Do you have an English-Yepian paper?
The gun's on.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's wrong with Tom anyway?
They had a child.
Tom looks upset.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilisation is now a threat to nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least in six.
I'm hiding from your clues.
The intuitive industry is very attractive.
I'll get it right back.
Tom and Mary are miserable too.
What group included your friend?
Just Tom, we'll stay.
Sit still, please.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "Marc Lap" and "Marc Krup" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can sense a close storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marv.
Counsel with the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound childish.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the fall, the color and the color were raised.
Tom never admit by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river in Japan.
Nobody's happy.
Finally, I don't owe anyone.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure to answer.
He's running his bike every week.
Don't turn the computer off.
This distance can't be seen anymore.
She's been guided by her previous doctor and transferred to another hospital.
I was unchallenged.
My best friend is Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only had a few beers.
The man who's running the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe my success to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him bite.
I moved to the next page.
Have you become an angel?
I hope it can happen now.
Materials will be consumed.
Did I touch an exposed nerve?
There are many places to spend in big cities.
The first blow is half the battle.
I'm not sure about that.
I really saw a ghost.
Did you recover from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
It's all on your head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary probably get married one day.
Their house was on fire.
I like this picture.
Take a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not that he died.
It didn't come up with her to answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
For this method, benefits and losses.
He hid the fact that he divorced his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
Peripheral experiment.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing harder.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's going up.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
It's Spaniards.
I want a guitar like John's.
It won't bother us if you take pictures from the outside.
The goal is to dedicate the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about this.
Are you from the support or from the resistance to fall?
Please don't get involved in this.
Long Time No C.
Today I'm not gonna get an e-mail from a man.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat cut his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.

You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscopic increases themselves by a hundred.
He's into duties.
Tom's an arrow.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
It's really impressive!
We wanted some rest.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom pointed his gun to the target.
I believe my friends are cutting my horns.
You better leave.
Donald Trump's suffering from insanity.
Don't ask, please.
I'm coming to kill you.
I love the time between the nights.
You should go.
Are you ready to go out?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown into prison?
I learned from the best.
Don't be quick to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Building space: it has to be used in protective helmets.
It's Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget what time it is.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She got caught with her pants down.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go so much.
How does everybody feel?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Did you eat breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do this.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges have made a decision.
It's hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.

It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday at my house.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I don't have any money.
I'll be able to read this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to meet my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks about three liters of water a day.
We never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers have attracted the news.
Please sign it.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
The show of heroes is a dangerous thing.

Tom looks desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
Those sitting in our homes along the river.
It was impossible to pull the pulse.
Today was exciting.
I'm on it.
Just the necessary repairs, please.
Salt, please.
Have you decided where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom's a accountant.
Raise your left hand.
I doubt his statement.
I think they got into trouble.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
To Tom's old piece of hat that he's always wearing in the rain.
Take your stuff and go.

There's something in the room that needs to be washed.
Everyone knows that the moon is just a bunch of yellow cheese.
We're out of cheese.
It looks like Tom enjoys work.
