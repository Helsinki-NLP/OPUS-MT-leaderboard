Time surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, theologians of religion, philosophy and science have studied time.

We have gained a close look at the past and at some of the personalities that have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the Organization, while listening to individuals while sharing their individual, family and organizational stories.
While understanding the individual ' s history was not necessarily supposed to understand his or her culture, it was at least helpful to estimate that individuals would find a sense of position in the Organization ' s history.
Individuals and participants in the process of assessing successes and failures in a deeper sense discover the values, mission and forces of the Organization.
In this case, the collection of previous models of leadership and people ' s successes has helped to accommodate new changes and the direction of the new local church.

Forty years later, a patent was awarded, which was the first patent in the world to be given in the field of magnetic imagery.
In 1977, Dr. Damiadin completed the creation of the first visual scanners of the magnetic reef, known today as the “invincible”.

The post-teaching curriculum provides freedom from divorce, and there is no good way to learn.
In fact, there's not one good thing you can learn, and learning happens in the experience between learning and knowledge presented.

Many of us find themselves watching a television programme that tells us a process or experience that we will never participate or apply.
We will never fix a car, build a car in our backyard, travel to Peru to study the old effects, or reconstitute our neighbor's house.

The South Arctic continent is the arbitrage on the ground, surrounding the South Pole.
Travel visits are costly, requiring physical alertness, can only take place in the summer of November to February, and are largely limited to the peninsula, the Islands and the Russian Sea.
Thousands of employees live here in the summer in about 48 bases, most of which are in these areas, and few remain until winter.
