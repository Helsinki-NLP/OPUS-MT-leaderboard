For a long time during the twenty-ninth century, New Zealand's indigenous people were the Maori people, who had been caught by the barbecue birds.
The theory confirmed the idea that the Maori people had emigrated from Poland with a large fleet and had removed New Zealand from the Morori to build a agricultural society.
However, new evidence indicates that the Mororis were a group of major Maori and Li emigrated from New Zealand to the Chatam Islands and developed their distinct and peaceful culture.

We have gained a keen view of the past and of some of the personalities that have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the Organization, during the course of hearing individuals and sharing their individual, family and organizational stories.

Magnetic radiation is based on a physical phenomenon called NMR, which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Black (from the University of Stanford) and Edward Bursel (from the University of Harvard)
With this resonance, magnetic fields and radiowaves are causing a memory search to send accurate radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and a research world, discovered the basis on which to use magnetic resins as a medical diagnostic tool.
Fourteen years later, a patent was awarded, and the first patent in the world was granted in the field of magnetic radiation.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the first photocopy scan of the magnetic renin, which today is called “the body’s body’s whole.
