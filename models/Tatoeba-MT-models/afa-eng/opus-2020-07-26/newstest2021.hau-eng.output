Dega says that when he stopped suffering the oppression of PDP Governor Bala in Bacchi, which finally helped him to succeed in 2019, he gathered a crowd to leave the party and returned to his place of APC.
A major reason for me was that I had to quit gambling as PDP ruled in the state of Bauchi.
Everyone knows what kind of fight I have played in the election of the governor of the former prime state of Abboja, Bala Mohammed, to a wealthy governor, Mohamed Abbocar.
Now, though, I am the only one in the state of Bala.
Instead of continuing to live in PDP, I was allowed to leave the room and return to where I had come from.
Dhagara wrote a visa letter from PDP sent to the president of the political party of his menu, Bogoro C, and the state of Bauchi.
Finally, he said that he wanted to show the other governors where they were going to work, and he was neither the anointed nor the carpenter.

APC Soils Governor Neja and Aqua Café Trazoma in the Community - Leader Hausa Newspapers.
In an announcement issued by the APC party, the government of Neja, Al-Ahabab Sai Bello, accused the authorities of bringing a conflict into the community.
The paper, led by the President of the Islamic Union and member of the Islamic Republic of West Muhammed Liman, pointed out that over six years the Council had found a ban on the State of Naira 512 million.
The paper continued to state that the meeting of the governor called the watercourses, which he took on the last Sunday night of the week of the Gulf, would help to further promote social harmony, where they said that they had written to the Society’s secretary that they had failed to keep the events in the state.
In India Umm, “the understanding of the Government of the United States has led to the division of members of the community by means of the planning of watersheds, which are not in an orderly manner, because any decision taken by the community leaders on the writing of a social contract has been made in order to investigate”.
He continues to say that in the six years since then, there have been 512 million members of the Council’s office.
He said that what he understood as a president was to be a member of a resolution committee that had been established on July 25, 2020, which the president had failed to organize in order to resolve the problems between a society with a cross-border effect on the judiciary.
On the other hand, we have received payments from social workers, as well as other social-related activities, financial and social problems, such as health insurance, because of the lack of access to government aid, not from a civil society institution that has not been executed on an organized basis, and we have to challenge everyone against the justification for breaking down of civil rights.
As I have seen, the ransoming effort of the former state officials is the most important ransom effort you have ever made in the country, with the senior committees and committees currently in power in all of the 25 state agencies, which have divided the committees to bring them to the men.
This is a mistake for every member of the community to have an individual killed on a case-by-case basis, which is almost unjust, and which is the result of a misdemeanor’s campaign by which he or she has been put to death, by not setting up a committee to investigate how to kill the community and who instituted it.
From the arguments that the terrorist claims that he has been accused of rape, it is the evidence that the Society’s secretary has failed to give, and I therefore challenge everyone in this respect on the basis of which his testimony proves his charges in any way.
Now that we stand at the top of the APC community from the top of the platform, whether by telephone or by phone from the top of the community, it is clear that the absence of any vote on the part of a society or of a party leader from the body's decision would be recorded as if the community system had appeared on the 21st (B) (b) (d) on page 82 of the social system.
Thus, the watercourses and the community’s hubs have no bridges, especially when they try to copy the committee staff so that their judgments do not have any effect.
For this reason, they are the principal social leaders approved at the State, in the 21st and 6th classes, on page 87 of the Social Code, and whatever the outcome may be.
Because of the judgment, you were wrong to decide whether you would be guilty or not.
He said, of those whom you propose to participate in an unencumbered meeting, which was not part of the Council’s committee, was not part of the Council’s committee.
The Committee of the Water Advisory Committee and the President of the Islamic Republic of India (Mhammed Immmam) should not direct him to be elected by the government to vote against the leaders of society.
According to the paper, Governor Abu Sani Bello recalled that the issue of the fulfilment of the State’s promises at the time of the war, along with the civil society’s parents, was how everyone would benefit from the political process by means of state aid, which was the problem of government and civil society.
The decision commended the Society’s Laws on the part of the parties to whom you attended the meeting and encouraged attention to the settlement of all social problems, not surprisingly, for the Councils that you identified as self-employed, so that you accepted as a law of society.
Hence, there was a need for a head of the resolution committee to draw the attention of Governor Abu San Marino on an appropriate position to combat the political unrest of the country.

Research shows that the fins and shoots in the market are used because in a few days they depict the trees.
Olasumbo explains that something in the market that could not be understood was the use of this device to express interest in health care.
Because of this, many diseases have been treated with such diseases as leprosy and leprosy, eye disease, breast cancer, malaria, and so on.

Equality Satisfied the Wealth of the Society and the Food - Leader Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all creation, and life cannot be lived without food.
That is why the Chinese judges were able to secure the wealth of the nation.
Over the past 71 years since the fallout of the Chinese Republic, the country has found great achievements in the area of food wealth and has wondered how much of the country’s population has actually averaged 1.4 billion.
This effort helped to explain why China’s army gave a huge escape against hunger on earth, just as the chief of the China Zheng Wufeng’s agricultural production agencies have always addressed the issue of the solution to hunger in front of all the country’s travel activities.
But in recent days, some people and other parts of the Western world have been “stirring up ” again on the subject, namely, that the Chinese court can raise its own nation in the atmosphere of COVID-19’s respiratory disease throughout the world?
We thank them for their daily experience in caring for the presence of the Chinese in this world.
Under the Communist regime in China, it completed its conquest of heaven with its food supply on the basis of the man’s struggle.
The case for Chinese is one of the largest government agencies of the JKS.
At the end of the week, under the direction of the chief JKS Committee, the chief officer of China, Xiepping, issued an important decree to stop the sale of food, where he pointed out that everyone knew that it was going to be served by any food plant or labor force.
Although the 19th year of COVID’s infectious disease was also causing economic damage to China’s economy, China’s territory could provide food for its nation.
The figures published by the Chinese Development Authority on the number of land items, especially those found in this year 2020, show that the number of land mines found in the first half of 2020 has reached 27.29 million, or 1.08 million, when it ran with 3.9% compared to the average in 2019.
He too said that the old president of the University of China, Ke Bingseng, found great victories in the face of wealth and food when compared to the first time the purpose of changing the customs at home with a door to a store.
Huang Jekon, director of the Institute of Research at the University of Peking University of Sin, appeared in interviews with a representative of the newspaper "The China Science Daily", that the challenge of the Chinese Empire is now in the next 2 to three years, or the Chinese may reduce the amount of wheat and butter in the storage areas.
Now the amount of grain each has to reach 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms each year.
And now China’s forest has brought home - to - house land items for the benefit of millions of domestic animals.
In turn, those expressing concern should calm their minds, bathe themselves into sleep, or place their minds on matters in the home of their limitations.
The Chinese may be able to raise themselves with their own food.
A barbed - in before the B.C.E., I was led by an army officer who led me to the Grand Duchy of the B.C.E.
This Kano’s campaign at the PDP Society’s Grand Duchy explains the reasons why it was made possible by the Dutch governor of Kano’s Office, Muhammad Gandaj, and others in the face of a state court.
The Great made that clear, by means of his lawyer, the Black of the Red Sea, who said that he had entered the village, on the basis of the subjugation of some of the government-owned businesses that the Kano nation was using.
In response to Kano’s governorship and the court, Great Joseph also took over the workers, the employees, the public buildings, the general buildings, the Kano Legal Committees and the public administration.
Uncle Josef accused the governments of the Cano State and the state of Doula of some of the senior citizens of Dalula and is now at the top of the Wudil Science University and the Shahushi University, who said that this would have provided the local laws.
Only qualify, when used with a card system in 2023.
This Umo and Kasa's Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Buhari, Mother Daura, explained that the regime of the Carbaab regime in Nigeria has now become an old country.
Mother Daura says that Nigeria has now abandoned a car-brain system to concentrate on the most suitable painting in 2023.
BBC Hausa published a conversation with a mother - in - law and the mother - in - law.
This draw-out program in Nigeria has not produced a blind child since 1999.
Rather, Dura recommended that concentration be given to determine who is entitled to determine who is responsible, not to follow this system of carbaby.
Only the Igbo tribe of Igbo, the Imiramites, made this comment on its own words.
They said that he and his brother, Buhari, had tied up the royal ladder by car and that he would now issue a decision not to do so in 2023.
He himself was not the most famous of Nigeria’s population.
The same is true of the high - security forces of this country, which live in the dusty region for several years, whose bodies are not removed, and whose bodies are no higher than those of the rest.
Immersive Marys.
A strong Nigeria’s political leadership that did not take place on Wednesday, when the Kare Congregation of Igbo Sala, Ndigbo, broke Mam Duura, because of the full expression of Nigeria’s leadership that he gave to the Inyjai tribe.
In one of the tests of Dura, who was then president of the Muhammad Buhari, he suggested that an order should be made to appoint the head of a failure in 2023.
That is why since the words did not end, Ndgbo was quick to issue an announcement to Mammal Duarte, calling it a novelist.
In an announcement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo Congregation of the South, and in the south to the South-East Sea, it will be allowed to appear in 2023, igbo.
Emama Attamah, the chief of the Igbo Sala Council, said that Mamura’s words, like the full command of Nigeria, were spoken in 2023 to the tribe of Igbo.
Apart from a storm, why has Mamman Dura stopped speaking carbaby since 2019.
They are concerned about driving Jonathan away, and now Dura sets out for the southern region where Nigeria will take the lead in 2023.
Only after he completes the series of events that arose from the hand of his brother and now brings to our attention another issue that we do not know in 2023 that of the car.
I needed to do so as an elder to open up the truth to her.
It is not that he spoke out in 2023 about the legality of that empire, nor does it mean that he was a selfish, self - centered person.
Weddings of Christian Discussions.
The issue of taking advantage of women and children’s opportunities through socializing became common in northern Nigeria where reports were received showing how children are being treated.
On July 23, a number of islanders came to the court to discuss how the situation was so bad and how it should be overcome.
Her husband and wife had to deal with such issues as child - rearing and other parental problems.
Many of the mothers who attended Hag Fahia Shaibu, an elderly governor of the state of Filto and Neja in the days of Sana’s mayor, described poverty as one of the many things that parents can do for their children.
She said: “I first have to go and give birth to mothers on the night before their children go out to school, for a child is to go out and be naked until the day is over."
We also call upon teachers to start preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who are singing to their children and to their parents.
It is also the Council of the Parties, which represents the Mayan males, Koko and Besse of Chebby Honrable Shehu Muhammad, explaining in detail the case and its support for the establishment of a strict law to punish anyone who was convicted of a criminal crime in the country.
From the bottom of the courtyard of the palace, David’s sons and the El-Hicaeans, who were engaged in the collection, were grateful to those who had attended the meeting at the branch office of the VOA that responded to their invitation.
The House of 'Northern Media Waters' G Hadin Canal North.
Modern - day peace campaigns, such as Facebook, Twitter, Watts App, Instagrim, Alexandria, and the like, are at the top of the debate, in the midst of the debate, in the midst of the world's civilized world, and in the form of escapistism, espionage, and political animism, education, and business.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology by means of social networking, such as travel to and from time to time, flighting or carpentry, and the maintenance of their tongue in the fields that affect their lives.
We might say, though, that all of this has brought us great progress in the business, economic, educational, and political interests of the North.
Some eat a meal by means of writing material, by hand to the press, by getting a job, or by cutting off the work they do.
It is sad to see how other youths instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to make progress, there are others who are following the standards of the children of the southernmost part of the country who are leading the world on social issues, both inside and outside the country, or who have written for themselves a list of acts of fraud and having opportunities for judges and teachers.
An indication of a lack of discernment is the advancement of the lives of young people in that area.
The trip to the North Medigues League in that country was a great favor, for it was a great honor for North American youths, a beautiful festival and a pedestal of what young people were doing in Soshal Medaa, in which they could be written with the meaning and meaning of the goals of the North nation.
It is imperative that we give this group the upper hand that they need, so that their noble purposes may be fulfilled, not just those of our northern region, but also those of Nigeria.
I recommend to our young people, especially those who use social media, to come and take care of the North and its environment, and we look for ways to make changes for everyone.
Just as our leaders in the North had the right to settle down in Sakwato, the first North Indians, Sir Amadu Bello, and its neighbors had come up with the desire to reach the northern nation.
It has been reported that, according to the leader, warlords, oppression, and poverty - stricken Mam Aminu Kano reportedly said that Nigeria was too poor, but everyone knew his father’s home!
That is why, as we call to heaven for progress and for better management of the government, in any case we can call to the North border, without any indication of religious or ethnic prejudices, to bring our territory to the fore.
When we consider how the North is no longer a part of this world.
Therefore, we should use God - given wisdom to make escapes and decisions, so that we can increase the economic and economic stability of the North.
The North should set in motion roads to address the limitations of its borderline without waiting for a government to grant a contract.
At the same time, to the extent that we want to progress in the North, we value education, agriculture, eyeball, health care, and science and technology.
There are many other ways to escape.
We believe that this is the way the North will fulfill our goal of reaching them!
The north is proud.
The government set aside 126 billion dollars to repair the country’s hospitals.
The government separated 126 billion publishers from the financial crisis in the area to improve hospitals in the country.
Hospitals that are to be repaired were the FMC Hospital, disease testing facilities, emergency care facilities, rehabilitation facilities with unwanted diseases, and 36 - year - old educational hospitals in that area.
In recent years some health - care workers have called on the government on the front side of the rain in an effort to improve the quality of the area’s health.
The students ’ call was at the convention for a meal on the sky, for good health care, and for the sound of a night in Aboja.
In the course of the talk, the president of the North Coast, represented by the Security Council at the bottom of the APC Sadiq Umar community, said that Nigeria’s government should take measures to improve the health care of these and the most important ones.
His failure to do so caused him to struggle with the problems of low self - worth, which led to her becoming more and more dependent on external resources.
Despite the widespread abuse, however, the government was forced to withdraw from the health - care facilities that they were offering.

Houngbo says that Coronavirus indicates that there is a privilege of preparing, dividing, and repairing the problem.

A farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, U.S.A., said that he planted the soil and planted it in a two - inch region in July.
Attodo said that he had acquired seeds from a market in his area and were part of two CP groups and a OC whereas he was using the Dachle cupboard to clean up the fields for planting plants and weeds.
At Titus Atondo, the challenge of growing a crop in a rural area was overwhelming because we relied heavily on the job, just as computers do not have access to the fields.
Titus Atondo admits that from the beginning of his campaign to the harvest, we were able to press people on to the field, where he felt that this was too tired and too heavy.
Attodo says that all the crops killed in his fields that are now now under attack are planted, cleaned, processed, and harvested totalling N220,000.

He said that the harvest season would begin in October through November.
He assumed that the sun’s rays at the end of the day would be 246,000 feet [46,000 m] higher than the size of Naira at each stage as the towering tower of three tons could be translated into Naira 360,000 on the hill of Naira 120 miles [120 km].
Instead, he offers suggestions and recommendations for field work, where he believes that, as a result of this, we are using plants-tsires that kill heavily, cannons and a medical device.

How the U.S. State University of Fascist (FUTA) copes with the Internet’s use of the PREMIUM TEMES page.
The Security Council (FUTA) has imposed a ban on the use of a gyzo-belts screen, for example, to run the PREMIUM METES, an "online" magazine in Nigeria.
It was not successful, however.
He started by trying to enter a "hucking" shop since February 28, where he was wearing a toolkit that he had played on the top of the University, and he hit a fire-fighter so that he could use the "data" to use this university.
On the other hand, when he makes his way through the Internet with a computer, he carries another type of GSM device.
Five days of lead were consumed by the opening of the front page of the Great Roman PREMIUM TEMES, but it failed, although it was used in the field of modern technology.
The university did not succeed, for it did not know that the magazine PREMIUM TEMES had its own plan, which built the wall, and it was not ready for any other forest to break.
PREMIUM also has a university degree at the top of the modern - day Web pages of this Grand Internet, which was played by King PREMIUM TIMES and Chief Agent, Gizon PREMIUM METES.
These universities have a modern - day career at the heart of every musical instrument or bar that seeks to chew it, or to play a mouthpiece in the Roman province of PREMIUM METES.
How the Internet Can Be Saved by the Internet:
Chapter 8 of the morning began running with a large, small, open - aired stream of PREMIUM METES, to see how it would blow through the air into it, and tore down the front corner.
Without success at night, the next day and in the morning, box 6:15 is again tested by the hour, which is done by using the "WPScan", to detect the habit or failure of large Internet surveillance devices such as PRIUM METES.
It was 90 minutes later that he began to run a life-raft with a sophisticated system of technology ("custom scrapt").
It is early in the morning and has done all the work that he can do through computer system settings to cover the pages of PREMIUM METS more than a dozen times.
How a Farmer Renews the Bierce:
This blacksmith did not know that PREMIUM TEMES had been using a large - scale beehive of bees and wells entering the modern - day media fields to cover either the page or the face - to - face surface.
This ignorance is the result of all the effort he has put in his hands, much more than an old - fashioned number of items that could not be harmful or harmful to PREMIUM METES.
On that day, he suffered the most painful blow of his life because he followed through the DDOS attack in Lake Liculu, an old route that had been taken since the Canon of Kauna.
It was March 3, but it was not successful.
This attempt to break the Grand Duchy of the Great Roman Premium METES came on days later, after PREMIUM METES published the story of the Inter-Secretian Tripartite Commission, Muhammad Buhari, in the fall of The Watchtower, and our Banguno with the old Head of the District of Kasa, Major of the Abba Khi.
Some members of the Foshai University of Akure, which is located in Akure, told PREMIUM METES that the university took over the high-level schools of other high schools for Internet access, so that they could connect to the main Rome of PREMIUM METES, abuse or destroy it.
Only after PREMIUM TEMES approached the FUTA university, she set out on top of the Internet with this master of the Great Roman TEMES (PREMIUM).
FUTA said that only if a university student tried to force him, not a FUTA prince, could he do so.

NAPIP saved 71 lives in the state of Kano.
The branch office in Kano, near the border with the NAPIP, three men were released and 71 were delivered from their hands.
The branch office in the state of Kano Shehu Umar announced this on the day of Jumaa, which was dealing with the National News Company of Nigeria.
He said that the governing body had given the spies a bribe after she had discovered the secret of the deeds of the spies in the country.
That is why the governing body welcomed all these people from July 15 to 19, where they were conquered.
Of the three men we had put together in Cameroon, only 21 to 36.
All these individuals were taken along the way to the territory of Algeria, Morocco, and Libya.
Thereafter, 18 out of 71 people who were to be released from Cameroon were to be found there, with 14 women.

Efforts to Provide for Self - Sacrificing, A Heart - Sausa Newspapers.
In the village of Longjionian, in the province of Wuzhong, in the state of Ningxia, she had her own hair cut off, located in the northeastern part of China.
A rich woman named Li Yaomei, or Sada (name of Islam) was famous for her hard work in life and for her hard work to break free from abject poverty.
Her story tells us that, in a sense, the effort and the desire to be self - centered is something in the heart.
At first, she had never attended a class that wanted to take a lesson, so she could not read it.
However, God gave her great gifts of wisdom, wisdom, and great wisdom, so that she became an example in the face of war and poverty.
For the past 20 years, Mamma Li Yaomie had to cope with a cancer disorder, where she had been diagnosed with cancer for up to 3 times.
After the rest of her life, she found herself in a terrible accident, and now she walks with the metal in her legs.
These challenges put her in a health - care situation, including health problems, so much so that she accepted a $3,000 - mile [3 km] loan.
To my surprise, this challenge posed another challenge for the Saudi Mother to describe to her another way of singing and dancing in order to see that she had improved her life.
Then the Chinese government’s appeals gave her more courage.
Its purpose is to identify different types of plants by means of grass.
Because of her man's efforts, her trade has grown considerably, where she has a man-made machine.
In addition, she developed a number of machines that helped her to simplify her work.
For example, she would take 15 minutes to combine one large ladder, but now, at this point, she would have to put together up to 5.
In addition, in addition to other seeds, the seed sprouts and sprouts that return the seed.
Then there was an additional supply of animal food, and now they are sold to those looking for it.
Seeing the challenges faced by the Saudi Teacher, as well as the efforts she still makes to improve her life and her employees, will help to see that my search for him is truly worthwhile.
Wars, poverty, and the improvement of life are not a matter of government trust.
If the government is going to increase the demand for education, but people are not happy or eager to improve their lives by making themselves work according to their attitude, only the front-lines will be pursued without any purpose.
Her experience shows that running a business or earning a income does not require funds or travel to other towns or foreign countries.
Because she took into consideration the circumstances in her life, using the spiritual blessings available to her environment in order to improve her life.
Moreover, these duties were carried out by the Swedish teacher, who left her behind without her husband’s trust and confidence in him.
In other words, striving to be friendly and self - seeking is a real thing in the heart.
This showed the strength of a woman to change her life and to stand up for her feet without anyone’s help.
This too is a lesson that shows that whatever a person does, he should stand firm for what he or she does not trust.
The Saudi Teacher has certainly been a hero, a master of skill and wisdom, an example and an example for other people.
To this day, until March, Mother Sadsia paid off all her debts, and then she stopped receiving State aid on her own.

There was a young man in the United States who was to blame for the Daquile COVID-19 - Leader Hausa Newspapers.
It was in recent times that the World Health Agency’s principal health agency, WHO’s Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, expressed concern over the steps that had been taken by some of its limitations, and maintained the lifeblood system of COVID-19, which was expected to be advanced, where it explained that, at the same time, it was necessary to defunct the body’s multiple limitations, while the whites were divided.
And it should be distributed in the most appropriate way in the world, so that the greater number of limitations can be earned.
In fact, some U.S. politicians have used the objective of displaying self - control, of dividing the immune system, and of disrupting the territorial and territorial harmony in wars and pestilences.
In a current attitude, the ever - increasing number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID 19 disease in the world has already reached 23 million.
The number of people who lost their lives has increased to over 800,000.
In the face of such a dire situation, more attention is given to the influence of the immune system, and more happiness is seen in recent times, the results of the study in certain disorders, the treatment that has been developed, and the beliefs of many parts of the world’s population.
Sadly, though, some American politicians have expressed the desire to seize the car.
Even the journal “Science” stated that the United States had already revised its contract to purchase COVID 19 and that its value had reached over 6, billion dollars from its various drug companies.
While the purpose of the American government has been understood, the presence of the United States is a primary concern to the spread of the disease, but the rest of those affected also need to be alert to the dangers of gambling, seeing that they are more likely to cope with health - care benefits than with medical benefits.
The "The Ecologist" magazine also pointed out that, if the U.S. fulfilled its purpose to deactivate the threads of the upper garment, then the number of irons that would be removed would decrease.
The chief nurse of the African health - care centre, CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, also showed concern for the subject.
Just as some commentators of everyday affairs have shown, even though the helmet has been won, it is impossible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, until the process of dividing, which is an important issue for failure and failure.
And it is fitting that the entire world should be able to strengthen the bond of hope between them.
The principal rulers of the WHO Tedros government, he said, must, in order to be seen after the disease, be taken over from all aspects of the world, and you may not be able to do some part of the world, or a few may not be able to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the scourge.

We Must Be Truthful in Nigeria.
An elderly president of the Small Court of Justice, Adversarial Justice, explained that reconciliation with the State of Katsina, with a gun, with a major error and damage to property.
Because he did not influence or signal to put an end to the killing of a gun that struck Katsina.
This is evident from the fact that Deuteronomy the Great, when speaking in private with the master of his household in Kattina, was among them, including the Leader today.
After the completion of the construction of a woman’s home with children, a woman’s five - and - a - half - seat shop was completed, and a businessman would build it at a large hospital in Katsina, the head of the assembly.
The former president of the International Court of Human Rights added that the reconciliation made with the gun should not be justified.

But the war that was to be fought would not result in the birth of this land with the firstborn Son, since all of them would be that tribe — the reconciliation was the right way.
