AMs from Wales fear that "they will be seen as a hero"
There is a fellowship among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of Parliament of Wales).
This was raised by plans to change the name of Parliament's assembly of Wales.
The AAMs around the political spectrum are worrying that this will make them appear restrictive .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Walles twp means iblh and pwp means rant.
AAM of Plad said that the whole group was not pleased and suggested alternatives.
Conservative by Wales said that his group had an "open mind" about the change in name, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Moppett".
In this context the letter w in the Walles language is presented in a similar way to the letter's prognosis and.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called Members of the Assembly will naturally be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Walles Government act empowered the Wales assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
As it appears, AAMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus may be a headache for the Chief Officer, Elen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the qualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they hold public opinion in a referendum on change in the name of the country
Votants will vote Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was established with a view to finding a solution to a dispute that lasted decades with the country in Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern garden name represents .
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a representative of the blessing on the change in name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But referenda supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Crafts Stop As Churchs in Harlem are sending
"Sorryly, the elderly I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there's no."
He said that he could understand how the bar disappeared.
He said, "People have different socialisations" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or tomorrow they will end where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches can be replaced by a block of apartments filled with condoms of the type of people who will not help the rest of the local quarters.
"The great majority of people who buy condoms in this building are white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not spend when it comes to the day they are mouthed for these churches because many of these people who enter these condoms will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of people of white carnage before Harlem became metropolis of people of white carnage - Metrolitan Comunity in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Community of white carnage people left in the 30th year.
A group of people of black carnage who was practicing religion in the near future took the title for buildings.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of people of black carnage under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a bout of retailers in 125 Street, a main way to buy in Harlem, who held renting or promoting black carnage people.
Nar left the building in 1939 with serious damage, but as the pastors of February Johnson made plans to rebuild it, commissioning the carilone.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Sister Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the Carlon "the sons of the people."
The expert who took up the carilone in July asked him another question: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to have a black carnage musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carlon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether said that St. Martin's didn't change with anyone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated history of troops and contractors, some of whom have been introduced by the leaders of the Laish Church, others from the evangelical Dioces.
The 'vestry' - the government body of the parish, made up of licit leaders - wrote the Diocese in July with concern that the Diocesis "will seek to pass the costs" to the victim, although the vestry was not involved in catching the troops and contractors he sent from the dioces.
Some of the parliaments complained about the lack of transparency on the diocesic side.
Sea dog harms a 13-year-old boy during the day for a student in California
At the time of the opening of the season, the authorities told him that he had been in a position to act as a member of the Council.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Ennitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was fighting with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then went there with a group to help pull them out of the water.
Hammel said that for the first time he thought he was the embodiment of having caught a hero, but then he said, "See that he was crying, 'Gidemen!
Gideoni!'
Do not open it and open all the club," Hammel said that he realized the moment the child arrived.
"I'm so excited that everyone comes out of water: 'He's a sea dog in water!' added Hammel.
Take the child by helicopter to Rady Child's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
The Lfegerard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that the shark was swallowed up in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous sea dog species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatistic wounds at the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Summi's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sinsbury's plans enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams with squash corridors similar to those of 'storage management' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial entry into the UK’s beauty market of β2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods are reduced, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops around the country and the idea will be spread in more shops next year if it is successful.
Investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the shelf that was once used for TVs, microwaves and articles for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said that he would double the amount of beauty items that he was offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
There will be more space for existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees with brand areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique scheme to make the majority of products fit for the wagons – something increasingly requested by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the Führers France Shoop will examine concessions in two Sansbury’s shops, the first one opened in Croydon, in Low London, the other week, while the second opened in Sylly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online purchase and a shift to small amounts of food per day in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sansbury's, said that shops will increasingly appear like 'department events' as the supermarks chain tries to fight against shops that counter Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
Sinsbury's has been putting Argos’ shops in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since he purchased the two chains two years ago, which says that he strengthened the sales of the truck and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarkets to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has not failed.
Sinsbury's tested a joint venture with Boats at the beginning of 2000, but the link ended after a fight on how to divide the income from the retails into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, to Ø 125 million, three years ago.
He said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of losusic skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Sensbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also been engaged in special trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate to all needs and the environment that attracts you and the convenient positions of shops mean that we have become a destination of the beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is 'very angry' after Holly Willowhby cancels an agreement of 11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after the TV presenter TV gave off an agreement of 11 million million with the business of his life-style firm to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spence and ITV
Willloghby does not have time for the firm of household products and their accessories, Truly.
The par business was compared with Gweneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The presenter of Theis Morning, 37, appeared on Instagrim to announce that she will leave.
Holly Willowhby left the personality of Dragons’ Den Peter Jones very angry because he cancelled from being part of their business of a life-style firm that made a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his huge business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with a value of up to 1.5 million - meant that it was not enough time to dedicate their business to home products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared with Gweneth Paltrow Goop’s firm and was thought to double the estimated wealth of Willohby of Ø11 million.
As soon as Willoghby, 37, appeared on Instagrim to announce that she would leave with Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private audiences.
Source said: "Truly was the first priority of Holly.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her with the next few decades.
Its decision to leave has left everyone entirely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost at hand.
There is a full store produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
The experts believe that the departure of the presenter of Theis Morenning, who is located among the profit-bearing personnel of the Great Britain, can mean a cost of millions for the company because of a large investment in products from millennia and candles to household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willoghby and her boyfriend Dan Baldwin have been very close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap for ten years.
Willloghby set Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered with them as president of the Chairman of the Chairman in March.
The two couples together and Jones have a 40 per cent share in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willloughby shall become a copy of the M&S firm and will replace Ant McParlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity of IT.
Tomorrow evening, a nearby source of Jones said, "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He's argued about criticism that will come from the news media because he made a comment that some people consider "non-presidency" and that it was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice that imitates that of "a news presenter".
"I didn't see anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump stated that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomatic, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea disarmament.
Instead, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in the speech of his demonstration.
He said, "We live well with North Korea."
"We will engage in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, the aid in the relief of warehousing and the return of the remaining American Protestants.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this area full of people, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing directly to the crowd before him.
Tsunami and Terremot in Indonesia Killing Island, Killing Hundreds of People
For example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move from their home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Shortly, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not requesting international assistance, so it was a challenge," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Paul, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palestine to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While stood by the tsunamis was built in Aceh, they did not see much on the coast.
The apparent absence of an alert siren of tsunamis in Paul, although an alert was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Paul, but it will last at least three days to arrive on the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Wiyodo has improved the infrastructure falling into pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration sent because of the lack of funds as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their home as Christians and Muslims fought on the road, using 'mathetes', bars and arrows and other types of weapons.

Daniel Sturidge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Calsea with a ‘goal’ in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturidge received the ball from Xherdan Shakiri while it was 27 metres away from the rubber of Celsea with his team that was losing 1-0.
I hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the rubber.
The ball is above most of the box as it ends in the right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball came down after Kepa Arzizabalga, who exceeded to try to meet, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get in that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him as far as possible, so I tried to give me time to myself as much as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming on me and touched the ball once and I didn't think about it much and tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea pastor distributed the ball back to Matheo Kovac, before leaving to the middle of the ground and then entered quickly in the middle of Liverpool.

Chelsea plays against Videton in the EUSC Europa League on the 3rd afternoon coming in London on Thursday.
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunamis rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesian tsunamis rose to 832, said the country's disaster agency early Sunday.

The status of the Parliament of Cromwell is the last moment affected by the argument about ‘the re-write of history’
His removal would be an appropriate form of justice for the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural acts carried out by his 'Puritan' spouses.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "mignant" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of states that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of the British civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his aunt Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still celebrating.
Mr Goldmith said to the Sonday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the Monarakia.
If this is a fully accurate representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century constitutes the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is identified as representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector’ also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.’
A Chinese Killer Attacks and Kills
A farmer was attacked and killed by a prisoner in a market in south-west China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his cojom "Yuan", was found dead with a cut, covered with blood near a dead market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
Pigs prepare to inject vaccines in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
As a result of the investigation, the Commission concluded that the measures were in place in the Union and that the measures were in place.
The next morning, his throat found dead, and discovered a door to the pig’s jaw in the open vicinity.
He said that there was a blood pig in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg prison had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Cunning legs were bloody and full of taste," said the voice, which referred to him with his voice "Wu," as quoted by the Guiang Evening News.
The security camera films showed Joan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about one hour later.
The animal which killed Yuan was not of the Yuan or of the kunginah.
Market manager told Evening News that the prisoner was arrested not to attack others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously registered.
In 2016, a prisoner attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered critically.
Ten years earlier, a 995 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he had cut off his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked and killed him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood taste can act as a "cause".
"They were playing.
They say, they are very curious ... they do not intend to hurt you.
You just want to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Uragan Rosa will bring a strong rain in the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Uragan Rosa is weakening as he walks on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods around the north of Mexico and the south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mf, Category 1 Uruguay, on 5 a.m. in the east of Sunday, and was located 385 miles in the south-east direction of Punt Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a 'trogh' on the Pacific Ocean and it is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Bay California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing a strong tropical comfort in the north-south direction towards the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching 'trogh' creates a strong rain in the South-East in the coming days.
Currently, from 1 to 4 months of rain will cause rapid floods, waste streams and possible discharges in the desert.
A strong tropical nation will cause rain rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 winters are expected in parts of the south-west, especially on most of the Arizona.
The rapid floods are possible with conditions which deteriorate rapidly due to the widespread character of the tropical rain.
It would be no good idea to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy storm can cause the 'canyons' to become dangerous rivers and the storms will bring a heavy, rising smell of local and dust.
The ‘trogh’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total of more than half-pulse rains are possible, which may cause small discharges of wetlands and wet roads.
This would be the first rain of the region of their winter season.
Some tropical rain fluctuations start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the winter becomes late Monday and Tuesday.
A strong winter is spread in Full Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
There may be some severe temperature changes across the US in October as the Arctic warms, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in the temperature of 20 degrees between Kasas City, Missiuri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the summer heat that remains will try to develop and expand again.
A large celebration from Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plans to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the Brett Kavanauth hearing
More than 20 million people have seen the very interesting witness of Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanah and the woman who accused of committing sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political fight continued, with the announcement that regular programming was interrupted by the surprising news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Falke for the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate’s Committee that it was certain 100 percent that Kavanauth Bosa when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove his clothes at post-secondary school level.
Kavanaugh, in a silent witness, said that it is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen are likely to be seen on Friday.
the company was counting the average amount of inspectors on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate how many televisions from offices there are.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Acady Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million telepetator during the hearing which lasted a whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC was just after it with 3.26 million spectrumr.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate office of the Republican issued a statement that would vote in favour of Kavanaug, those who protected from CNN and CBS cameras were arrested on Friday morning and were crying with him as he tried to rise on the lift for a hearing of the Committee of Justice.
He remained there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a direct broadcast on CNN.
"Stand up here before you I," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to a country?
"You have the power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the doors of the lift, that he would have more to say at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
But Falke said that he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person in the following week, that the democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Flake was partly convinced by exchanges with his friends, the Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cons and several years later, Falke took his decision.
The decision of Falke was empowered, as it was clear that the Republics would not have the votes to approve Kavanah without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation of the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused the critics who are "taking advantage of the policy" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union that are "advancing" from policy and undermining national interest in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May came to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson put forward his attack on the so-called ‘Chequers’ Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was ‘completed’.
Launching on Wede Sims: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of the LSU players
The police arrested a suspected person in the shooting who killed Wede Sims, a 20-year-old band player of LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second grade murder charges, said the Police Department of Baton Rouge.
The officers issued a film of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his hunting during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the ground and said they found Simpson DNA on it, reporting the CBS filter, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to shooting and killing Wede.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reporting the Advocate.
He issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is harmful to a gun from the head to the neck.
The department is crediting the task force of the Louisian State Police, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the South University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's English director Joe Alleva thanked the area law enforcement for "divorce and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 metres long, dusted in Baton Rouge, where his father, Guy, was also a band player for LSU.
It was an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 'refounds' each game in the past season.
The morning, the LSU Will Wade basketball coach said that the team is "swift" and "swift" after the death of Wede.
"This is what worrys about him all the time," said Wood.
Vulcan throws the ass on Mexico City
Disposed enemies of the Popocatetpetl have reached the southern capital area of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the trailer was increased and 183 gas emissions and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and telecommunication movements.
Stamps on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windscreens in the neighbourhoods of Mexico City such as Xocimilco.
Geography figures noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south of capital following an earthquake of 7.1 at the Mexico centre in September 2017.
The known volcano "don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with separated persons from Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protestors had a conflict with the anti-infectious police, and as thousands joined the revolution demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia’s polarisation vote on the recession.
A group in favour of the coverts who were kept back by anti-rheumatic police have planted eggs and powder paints, and have created a dark dust cloud on the generally tourist-filled roads.
There were also small fighting during the day and the police had to use the blades to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were fighting "We do not forget, we don't discuss" fight against unirritants who were crying, "Spania For All."
Fourteen persons received treatment for minor injuries that they received in the proteases, reported the local picture.
There have remained high in the region which wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by separates from Catalonia.
The voters chose with a great tendency to become independent, although participation was low with those who were against the recession which made a major counter-voting decision.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were visited last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Groups in favour of independence had fought during the night on Friday to prevent demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration was made but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist who attended the separate protectionist with his wife said that he did not lose hope in the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we are all together," he said.
Although they had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalonia’s parties are sending to maintain the momentum this year with many of their best leaders known either in their own decision or in detention and are awaiting the process because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old machine that was recording the protection on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by both sides' policies.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who is in prison before the process since the end of last year, announced that he will challenge the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"As soon as I come out as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the repression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered the house safely
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after having entered a car more than once by force into a house in London.
The incident took place in Ballenagard Crescent on Thursday for the closing of 19:30 BST.
An investigative inspector Bob Blemings said that the damage was caused to the grades and to the building itself.
It may also have been used 'crossbow' to shoot the car at some point.
Menga Goal wins game 1-0 for Livingstone against Rangers
First ‘goal’ of Dolly Menga’s for Livingstone restored the game
Livingstone, which has been promoted, bred to Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second only time in 18 games as a ‘club’ coach of Ibrox.
The shooting of the Dolly Menga's ball made all the difference as the side of Gary Holt was equal in points with Hibernian in second place.
The side of Gerard has not won again outside her card at the Premiership in this season and the next Sunday will be played against Hearts, who first placed and followed by eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their graph in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingstone continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with the main Holt coach who has not yet played a game since it was replaced by Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities against Goffi visitors
The team of Holt Messus has been winning before he had a ‘goal’, with a direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the basket, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he drew to get the ball off the head from Craig Huckett near the lat.
Those who were playing in their own card were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that they were to the visitors who could give them the problems at certain times.
And what was the way that came to the crucial 'goal'.
Rangers allowed 'free-kick' to enter and Livingstone took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it in the basket from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were controlling the possession of the ball, but they were finding the defence of the team that were playing in their own card, non-pentable, and the ‘goalkeper’ Lam Kly had no trouble,
That game style continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find a ‘goal’ because of the ‘goalkeper’ of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow fired the ball wide after they distributed another player of Livingstone.
Blen were all the time in the Livingstone box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty’ – after the Halkett attempt to replace Glenn Midtelton, and another after the ball was handed over by players – were rejected.
Feemenals from Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenonal outcome for Livingstone.
For a man, they were excellent, continued to exceed expectations on this trajectory go up.
The games style and their staff have not changed much since the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way the team has combined since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroin.
Chief Hallett was very big in his games, by organising a well organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Wall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at some times under Gerard, there was a lack of standards well on time.
Their last opportunity with the ball was not good - only once they managed to separate the defence of the team that was playing in his own board - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people looking and hearing blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with a view to improving NATO allied relations.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosca.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons for blocking a large crowd of 25,000 people from collecting in front of the garage, but many people supporting it came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of rebels against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also mentioned their voice, condemning the policies of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome them to the country.
Anti-attacks reflect the separation of a visitor who is heroic for certain German Turkishs and is thought to be ‘autocrate’ by others.
Road connection in Deptford: Ciclast died in connection with a car
Ciclist died in a car accident in London.
The crossing took place close to the interruption of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic route in Deptford, south-east of the city, to the opening of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedia, but the man died on the spot.
This fine happened a few months after another cyclist died after having hit a car and kept going in Child Street, around a distance from the wall last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and car deviations of the line are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Lung Lartin Prison: Six Officials are engaged in disorder.
An official prison house was visited following an occupation in high security men's prisons, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started at HMP Long Larin in Wicestershire for the closing of 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialized officials "Tornado" have been introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor injuries on their face on the ground.
Prison Service speaker said: "Prisonaryly trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year the anti-trust officers were called to prison to address a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked by the ‘pull’ balls.
The Uragan Rosa Jahmed Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Malayar Birds (Nexfa Areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to occur early next week as the remaining energy of Morgan Rosa moves from south-west of the Treasury, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temp Service has already established a fast flood alert for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from on Phonix on Tuesday, and approach late on Monday.
The National Peopleix Service noted in a video that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained status of tropical weather or depression within 200 miles from Phonix since 1950"!
Katrin (1967) was a hurricane at 40 miles from the AZ border."
The last models of the National Centre of the Uragani forecast from 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other regions of the south-west of the Treasury including the central Rockies and the Basin Great is likely to have from up to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those who are at a rapid risk of floods, the rain of Rosa can be positive as the region is hit by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the South-West side is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, second highest category," reported by a weater.com.
First, the Rosa route was delivered to catch up with the Mexican Baha California Peninsula.
Rosa, who will still be a very powerful hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum height of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punttu Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
As a result, it is expected to touch Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of floods.
"Total of rain of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baia California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches", reported by weather.com.
Then Rosa will travel north as a tropical storm in Mexico before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as tropical depression, and then travel from Arizona and south of Utah until late evening.
"The main threat expected by Rosa or its remains is a very severe impact in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the south-east of the United States," they said from the National Centre of the Uragani.
This rain is expected to produce rapidly life-threatening floods and waterfall flows in deserts, and valanges in mountain terrene.
An attack in Medsomer Norton: Four arrests following murder attempts
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after being found a 16-year-old adolescent with scarf wounds in Somerset.
The child was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Mesomer Norton area, for the closing of 04:00 BST on Saturday.
Take him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
Avon, said Somerset Police, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man who was arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a film drawn from the mobile phone of what happened to him to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "sent the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Vot for Judge Kavanaug is a vote to refuse the merciful and disgusting Tats of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sent his anger and anger’ of the Democratic Party during his designation process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, with power and emotion denied an allegation by Christine Blasy Ford who was sexually attacked decades ago when they were adolescents.
She also testified during the hearing on her allegation.
Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the Bavaria and the quality and courage" of Kavanah.
"Vot to confirm to Judge Kavanah is a vote confirming to one of the most recent legal minds, a journalist with an improbable public service record", he told the group of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanah while speaking on the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term elections.
"There are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
Not to challenge, but actually, I'm challenging," he said.
"So I run everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and prevent."
The first main procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's designation is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a top assistant of GOP's leadership to CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunamis, with the number of deaths that appear to be increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many have suffered as huge waves have fallen by sea, after a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Solawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were collected for a holiday on the beach in the city of Paul on Friday when a wave of up to six metres (18 ft) fell by force on the ground when it started to rain, while many were injured and killed and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 power.
"When the threat of tsunamis came out yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not stand to happen immediately and victims," said Sutopo Pure Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesia disaster mitigation agency BNPB during briefing in a paper.
"The tsunami did not appear on its own, attracted cars, logs, houses, killed everything that was there on the ground," said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami was travelling along the open sea with speeds of 800 kf (497 mf) before the shore hit.
Some people went out to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were deported to 24 centres in Paul.
Air strikes issued by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that turned on themselves and fell and a water-watered moske.
Strong shocks continued to threaten the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy that emerged from the massive earthquake of the Week was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow sea, could have grown the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found caught under the fall of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the thanks and damage can be greater along the coast 300 km (190 km) north of Pallu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "was fully sent and without information" by Dongala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already tragic, but it can go worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Paul, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
In a film of social media shared digitals, a man on the top floor of a building can hear warnings of anxiety for tsunamis approaching people on the way below.
In a few minutes an enormous amount of water has fallen by force on the beach, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the films immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused a strong break of light that has reduced communications around Paul and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military began sending cargo aircraft with the aid of Jakar and other cities, but the extracts still needed food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
It was scheduled for President Joko Wiyodo to visit the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of the World Vision's from Dongala came strong and full in the city of Pallu, where the employees were able to be armed tarpoles in the courtyard of their office, they passed a deevasive scene on their way there, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "He told me that he saw a lot of houses that we would destroy."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster aid, some of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not being allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel abroad can only start if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"For a disaster of provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"Since the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Paul following the September earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that will bring up this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young child came out of the drain.
On Sunday, people who perform rescue saved a woman who was caught under the bat for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, who had finished early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught in the Lukanda Roa Roa, including Mr Mandiga, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, at the hours after the news of the fall of the Lukunda Roa Roa circulated among the parking community, he sent messages with WhatsApp to Paul's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they had arrived.
"I think what it means that the messages did not come," he said.
Hallillins take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Leve

Kanye West: The chance of the therapy changes its name for Y
The chance of the Canye West therapy is changing his name - for Y.
Proclaiming the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was formerly known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Y for some time and used the monker as the title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album running.
It replaces the Canta Ariana Grande on the programme that was cancelled for " emotional reasons", said the programme's founder.
In addition to being an abrasive of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for it.
"I believe that 'you' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you,' said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you are, I am, she is, we are.
From Kanye which means 'the only one', for He only - simply reflecting what we have, wrong, what upsets us, everything.
The album is more thought of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous parasites that have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Sunday, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced to prefer the names Love and Robert Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, he was also killed with or without sing and capital letters.
Mexico's promise not to use the military against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use a military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody trauma against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Tlatelolco Park that "they will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the box on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and practitioners of IAka-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is no formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in the IA innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are much further back from the US, and we are looking for the next revolutional step in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funds could double the possibilities that the next large achievement of the IA will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in a weekly interview.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hoghton Miflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mello, he worked on an IA system which won the players with the highest classification of American Othello, after which he was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
I have recognised previous competitions of the US government in technology such as the Robotics Chalenge Agency of Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it will be the next one, in order to help identify the next interviews.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to take grants from the government.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing so."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recruited people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have Dottorat in the IA."
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the China National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
More than eight this year, the U.S. Defence Department has established a Joint Artifical Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artifical Intelligence.
DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the US legislation which tried to create a National Security Commission on Artifical Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "The Republic of the North Macedonia", a step that will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the January to the north represents a possibility of ownership of its territory and has made a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments came to an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the population of the Slovak majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a block campaign raised doubts as to whether the participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have been voting today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the flag of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgejevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I've been to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Giusee Tanevski, 62, voter in capitals, Spokje.
The MM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country that gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was clearing a small room and preparing seats in front of the armed chain by those who will make a calendar of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to be brought in proudly under our conditions, not by ordering others," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour of more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Kingdom Policy Research Institute stated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the necessary participation.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia’s TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western thinking from the moment it took control over it in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, the Master of the Manchester City, passes through all of the Braighton defence to ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Raeem Sterling broke Braighton's defence in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Minsk, England.
Aguero did that his ‘goal’ in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from the half of the board at the beginning of the sequence.
There are three Brightton defenders before a race into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green holes.
He fought with one defender before running away from much more to the end of the Britton box.
Then he distributed the ball on his left and found Starling.
The English attacker sent the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to enter the ball on the right side of the net by passing it from where the Goalkeper of Braightton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending some problems in his legs," said the coach of City Pep Guardioola to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good things that he did 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Starling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight against Premier League.
That ‘goal’ occurred in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball very inside in the territory of Britton in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left in a very beautiful manner.
Sane touched the ball a little before leading to the Sterling where the rubber.
The attacker of the Sky Blues slightly touched the ball and entered the net just before he was wet into a territory that he was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Champion League groups at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arna in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer has to play in spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But the player so competitive Scherzer has been able to be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies succeeded in achieving a possibility of continuing to compete with a victory 5-2 against Nationals Friday evening, but are still looking for the first title of the division.
"As we play for nothing, we can at least have the possibility of winning by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who is going to start for 34 times, has a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a peacher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington who plays with a right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout’ in 220 2/3 ‘innings’ in this season.
Trump manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Bert Kavanaugh, speaking on the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very great -- not to challenge, but, in fact, I'm arguing so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very and radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now," continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back the power by using any possible means, you can see the work.
They do not care about who hurt them, who want to fly to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and prevent."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats " angry and green and disgruntled and dissident."
He referred to the Democrat organized in the Justice Committee of the St. Diane Feinstein with his name, and received a lot of negative violence from the audience.
"Remember its answer?
Is the document issued?
Uh, uh, whatever.
No, no, no, I wait, first the movements of her body were not positive--the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
It does not tolerate the person who communicates its views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to protect me, she didn't do so much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed - because we communicated our opinions.
My parliamentary college Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of a critical cassette because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, notably, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday declared that "the meetings should be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local MP, the meetings of the General Council of the Week in the evening were exactly so.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the "more compassionate and gentle" policy promise that has ever forgotten if, in fact, it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jerrey became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar policy began to expect me to change my understanding and to take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in fact, don't make a difference - they happen to be followed by abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my MP post, defeat the centre's policy, and tell me that they are not part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I had more good looks than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but are never concealed from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of "uncertainty" or change in selection rules, the party becomes narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that have encouraged me to keep my views for me, so that I don't be so loud and then everything "be good."
But I did not join the policy to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provided by the neglect of the government of Thatcher that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disaster stage, I have sought to improve public services for those who need it most - both as a local adviser and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, even in the past election.
No one in Nottham East could have been, in some way, confused about my policy positions and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, I say that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I can't understand the desire to save time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that will remove me from my post or from political exposure do not discourage me from acting in those who believe that they are your best interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Aar, not yet lost, top-down in class
Two attempts could have changed slightly the result, but there was no doubt that Amir should have won this so exciting day's game of the Grant's Premiership.
Currently they are first in class, the only team of all ten that have not lost one time.
Finally, it was the superior defence, as well as their ability to benefit from the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own card, to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have come from trials during our games so far, and we have not lost one, so I feel happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We give Air credit, they've earned better opportunities than us."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climmo, Amir were winning, but, a yellow paper from the head of the Church of Rory Hugues, who was allowed to play the game from the Waris, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Bagout made a non-converted attempt.
Climoma extended the victory of Ayr with a 'penalty', before, in the middle of the exact game, made an individual ‘goal’ and converging to the points came 17-5 for Amir in the wage.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson's, converted by Bagout, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruardh Knott, which came out of the ground on a stripper, and as soon as the game started again, Amir continued to take the points after attempt by Stepford McDowell, converted from Climo.
Then, the chief agent of Amir Blair Macpherson was given a yellow paper, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when they made a non-converted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own card began to attack again, and when a yellow Struan Hutchinson card was given for action that it took on Climom without the ball, from the line of 'penalty', MacPherson touched the ball to the ground on the back of the advancing Ayar group.
Climom converted, as he did once again from the area from which he started the game, after he gathered the ball to meetings David Armstrong from inside the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who plays with the side, for the five attempts of the side that was playing in her own card.

In addition, the Commission notes that the Commission considers that there is no reason to conclude that there is a need for the Commission to assess whether the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will again open a path to the Pacific
The seafarers guard the Naval headquarters with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building has a blue flag the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motor: "The sea is ours right.
That we recover it is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast destroyed to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century resources remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be located at its highest level in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and prosperity, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive intention," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomatic.
Many Bolivians will see the JJ decision on large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague finds, in favour of the Bolivian statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and grant the sovereign bluefin tuna to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous headmaster - facing a counter-election battle next year’s re-election - also has much to lose in the decision on Monday.
"It's very close that we get back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that it would change slightly if it did so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the JJ judgment is only six months after the final arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And away from the case of Bolivia, the last four years could not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been solved by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The oscillate rector of Morales weakened any remaining Chilean accident, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not married immigrants since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never exceed its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be done unless it can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea says that his nation will never destroy nuclear weapons is first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the patrols.
It passes its comments as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompoo, appears to have come to resume the nuclear diplomacy located more than three months after Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong un.
Ri says that it's an "invasive hope" that the United States sanctions and the US objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned whether to agree with the declaration without making Pyongyang the first significant disarmament steps.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is widespread seismicism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce the weapon that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pumpoo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trumm summit.
The particulars of the Paris mode reveal the last collection of clothing for the massive head that will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to the collection of your hats or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Browne designers revealed a range of strange head clothing and very large for their spring and summer collection in 2019 on the track that has expanded the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
Many non-precise hats are very visible on Instagrim this summer and these designers bring up their surprising creations on the plaque.
The particular object of Valentino was called for extravagated beige with a wide edge similar to the feathers that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other large-sized transactions included joint-chilled contempt, a squash appeal and even annabas - but not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also revealed a strange screen selection - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured screens had the lips dressed and were more similar to Hanibal Lecter than ‘haute couture’.
One reaction resembled the complete equipment with a snorkel and goggles, while the other was like a con of dried ice.
And if it continues with this good-looking style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge 'bonnets' will soon appear in the main shops.
The very big hats come out after the exit of La Bomba, the appeal of the boy with a broad edge of two feet which was worn by all from Rihana to Emily Ratajkski.
The 'cul label' responsible for the appeal that is not practical that much appeared on the social media have raised another great creation on the child's palette which contains almost as much as the model malay dress as it was carrying.
The black orange suffocation basket, surrounded by the thin shoulder and white skin cap, was the most remarkable creation in the spring and summer collection of Jackson in Paris Fashion Week.
Fascist Lukee Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large sea hats and bags in the main shops for the next summer -- since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Skills in languages essential to global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examination results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to give students and their parents the best level of service.
Independent schools aim at preparing their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement personalised curricula, we are seeing modern languages remain subject to popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we need to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are taking the lead in classification tables with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students achieved grade A higher.
The data collected from the 74 schools which are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as a subject's option, are now kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and other buildings.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers who are sending to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career to choose, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to live such a life.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically put a multilingual person from the front in competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, with 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken by a percentage of two numbers.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
To know more than one language, in particular those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant work.
In Scotland, every school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages you can choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scotch independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied, at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
The white outlet no fair.

On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
The sports parties of LeBron James have no longer had much to expect to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lukee Wallton's coach announced that James will play in the opening game before starting the Sunday season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to be played has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Laker website.
The reporter of the Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the earlier practice session this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games schedule before the start of the Lakers season.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Express of Trump in West Virginia, Yourtube Canal
President Donald Trump starts a wave of demonstrations of the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable places including Tensey and Fatherszeppi.
With a suspended confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacant place at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections as the Republics are at risk of losing the control of the Congress when voting in Nov.
At a time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how does it occur online?
The demonstration of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the President of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanauth, who became intensive due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of manifestations is to help the Republics face the November elections to get a little momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and parties as soon as the Republics try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Deputies", according to Reuters.
"Congress Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we can as close to the commitment campaign season," he told Reuters spoke for the Trump campaign called by his name.
A schedule for the Wesbanco Area in Wheeling, the night atmosphere can collect parties from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pitsburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is missing in the survey.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to boost him in the survey," said Simon Heeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: The United States of America Teams determined not to give up while looking forward to Sunday's Sings
After three sessions of one side, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momental pendulum pendulum is a fully invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So what do they say is the momentum now?
"These were at the front with six points and now are four, so I think we're carrying it as a little moment," Jordan Speth said as he left during the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four front points with twelve more to play.
The Americans, says Spethh, feel but have a few obstacles and have many things to encourage, not at least the form of Spethh and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one opens with three points from four.
Speth it was precise from how much to green and is leading by example.
That cry from the heart of celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, by making a crucial past to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two from under two.
His spot that won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera must go deep and worry about your own subject," said Spethh.
This is what each of these players has given them now.
18 rounds to mark.
The only players with more points from Spethh and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleewood, the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet copy of Europe is four with four and is considered perfect.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not show up on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the 9th after Friday morning.
That story, and the way their energy goes to and from this living room sets out to be the players that are offering a Sunday challenge, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Gold National from Flywood or Molinary.
preferably both suddenly on different holes.
But here we speak of a European glory that is still early.
Web Web Simpson quickly completed by Sergeio Garcia, the morning fürball hero, when placed in a park with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front room were brought to Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they had never been able to move near to get out of it.
But Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursosomes are very impressive to see them closely due to peer interactions, advice they give, advice and how a strategy can be changed in a second.
Europe was better fed as a team, so it came to the front on the final day but this round of posters has also shown that the United States Team has determined that some, especially on the US side, were questioning.
Europe in the front with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after exiting from the top 10-6 on Saturday's football and foursomes parties on the US.
The inspired side tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary made the effort with two wins on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so far in Le Gold National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in morning brochures, which took the series by 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, by winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in the score.
The Jim Furyk side required eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday player to keep the trophies.
Feletwood is the first new European to the season which won four points next to each other while it and Molinari, which were set up "Molliwood" after a sensuous webcast are only the second pair that won four of their four opening points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After ruling on Woods and Patrick Reed in the bearings, they worked excellently to win Woods that did not appear optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with even more hepatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parts of the Saturday, showed occasional moments of prosperity but now lost 19 of his 29th in the boreballs and the foursomes and seven behind each other.
Justin Rose, close to morning's bearings, returned to Henrich Steven's partner in the foursomes for a loss of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Koepka Brooks – which are classified first and third in the world.
However, it has not done as much as Europe wished on a beautiful day, with a little sharper in the south-east of Paris.
Jordan Spethh, a great winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americas with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave victory of 2&1 on John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the portals and returned later to win Poulter and Roy McIllroy with 4&3 in the poursomes after losing the two opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that returned from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although the holders of the Furyk side need a mirror to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday fight appears to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "no way" will unilaterally destroy without confidence
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that the continued sanctions were undermining its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would have left its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "extreme good will measures" last year, such as the setting up of nuclear and missile tests, the site of the nuclear test, and pledged not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way destroy ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "pronged" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly not to reject unilateral decollarisation without considering how it had done Pyongyang in the past.
Re referenced to a joint statement issued by Kim Jongun and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president serving his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "deuklearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the US said that Pyongyang first had to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a coersive manner, and also objects to the "end of war" statement," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part of this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a block."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US continental land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Kafiti" Trump called Kim "rocets man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely kill" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that there is still much work to do and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea denulsises.
Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If you take two years, three or five months - you don't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompoo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that "the enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without cease until we realize fully verified decalarisation."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pumpoo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompoo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been well.
He left Pyongyang in July while he said that progress had been made, after he had in a few hours criticized North Korea for making "dungster-like requests".
In a meeting with Moan this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been successful in making all its students who have not yet graduated sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture to study all night and remain up thanks to caffeine.
The academic found that students at university in the first place in the world often have no idea about basic real things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after having made a speech about the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"At last she was a girl on me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said that nobody had ever told her about the importance of sleep - that I was sorry," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and academic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of a psychiatric clinic at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that the students had had a serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a school bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, puriters, traders and books to share the effects of coffee and light and on how anesthetic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
It then encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
"We know that it won't change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know -- as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added the Prof Czeisler.
A culture that is proud that "success to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that it sleeps enough, and of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, since sleeplessness puts the brain in hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, 19-year-old from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course around the whole campus.
The next step, it is to expertly ask all students who have graduated to carry out a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for getting up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from the electronic screens and LED light, which can distort your circular rhythm, and lead to problems to sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal loses Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of distress when they played abroad as the Dollly Menga show the divided side of Steven Gerrard for a loss of 1-0 in Livingstone.
Ibrox's side was looking for a record of their first victory while traveling from February 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused the second loss of Gerrard in 18 items as manager to leave its side eight points away from the major leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga ran seven minutes before the half-time and the list of Ragers missing inspiration never appeared to have been reached.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone is raised to the third and only after Hibernian on a difference of goll.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the Linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in a head after he had apparently been strangled by the parties of the team who played outside his country.
Gerard made eight changes to the past side of Amir to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased in the way his well-trained form has continuously hindered their opponents.
Rangers could dominate the possession but Livingstone did more with the ball they had.
They had to run only two minutes from the start when the first-time play-off of Menga sent Scott Pitman to a gullet of McGregor god but the waiter took his big chance.
Free-kick strong of Keaghan Jacobs then found the Kraig Halkt sticker but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only run from behind.
Rangers achieved the control but it appeared that there was more hope than believing about their game in the grand final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the mark of fifteen minutes as soon as he and Steven Lawless committed his relationship but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Communist appeals.
Rangers managed well to target only two options in the first half of the item but the previous goalgeier of Ibrox Liam Klyly without worrying him about the sudden head of Lassana Collibly and the light slide of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first Liví's bell in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that it was just for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage good Jacobs' set-by-case.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher activated the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerard reacted in the brake by replacing Cololibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winder turned in Morelos but the impressive Kly wound from his line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to draw visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who caught a long ball after a long ball.
The Holt side could extend their front position at the final stages but McGregor kept well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went to open from the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Midtelon had another request at the time for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked on the other side.

And now page from our Almanak of "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, as today 136 years today, and FOR DNAS WE DO ... the day on which the future physics Jones Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the equipment known as the Geiger Contractor.
A science foundation since then, Giger's contractor has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those unlikely cobbies scientists look like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What kind of man is that man?"
Rogers: "That Guiger contractor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these hats, you can currently hear the effects of the atomic-producing toxins in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, sure it's popular now!"
"Hans" Giger died in 1945, a few days before it ended 63 years.
But the invention by his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which is transformed into a laboratory.
These can then be a common protein for many cancers and then re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, these are changed into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a common protein for many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Beethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "to boost the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained the Prof Bezofsky.
A similar approach to the administration of immune cells by patients and how to ‘learn’ how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Caney West Made A Verbala Favur Trump, while wearing MAGA's Beritta, after his appearance on SNL.
This Is Not Good
Kanye West was bombed at the study during Saturday Night Live after a confusion performance in which the US President Donald Trump said that he would come out for the election in 2020.
After giving himself his third night's song, which is called "Survivor "Tow" in which he was a white dress of Mac America Great, he began to say against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
"We know many times I speak to a white person and say, "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If I was concerned about racism, I left America," he said.
SNL started the programme with a sequence of the comedy in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star reviewed the statement by Bert Kavanaug in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Bassey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's video on the social media by the Commissioner Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to take you with West when he was ahead of him.
In addition, West had complained with the audience who had caught him after the dispute about his redemption.
"Buy me behind the cheeks.
They said, "Don't go out there with that brutish."
Bring it to me!
Then say they're lost," said he, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the lift? And he continued saying that he would've dressed the cap of my superior, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to go ahead?
Try with love."
His comments were repeated at least two times by the audience and members of the SNL cassette appeared to be inundated, reported Varty, with one person there who told the publication: "In all the course, there has been a large silence."
West brought it as a late substitute for the Cant of Ariana Grande, which the boy-friendly she had, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West has buried many with the performance of the song I Love it, dresses as Perier bottle.
West had support from the president of the TTPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most brave spirits: GRADES OF THE BELIEF TO THE FOLLA."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something very beautiful."
"But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") that I believe that he is engaged and disseminates Ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Another way we are," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, by saying that now it was "what was formerly known as Kaney West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Mandy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music race that no longer accompanied us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The game star of Theres Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role to move the sword as Jon Snow in the violent gang of HBO Game of Therenes.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the Heroy Macho stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the jury often feels that they must be violent in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Meto era.
Kit, who recently married his match of game of Theres Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he had "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, do I feel that I have a strong interest, right now - where we went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What do you learn on TV, and on the streets, making the journalist feel that this is a male’s fault?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change this?
Because it's very clear that something went wrong for the jury."
In the interview he also admitted that he won't make a prequells or squeezes of game of herones when the series comes at its end the following summer, by saying that "just like wars and horses".
As of November, Kit will appear in the new production of Sam Shepard True West which is the history of a film producer and his brother, which he left.
The actor recently revealed that when he met his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of game of the Trones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in this way I gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the band that won in Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the land of the Leslie family's property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% gap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officers at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, one year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who were sexually involved with men would eventually marry women.
Most disease transmissions come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed GOP sensors data, says "dangerous lie" and "fooling theory"
The United States Representative Maxine Waters sentenced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. U.S. Republicans on the pages of Wikipedia legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were being disseminated by volunteers and websites of the "top right-hand".
"A lie, a lie and more lies of the sneezers," she said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly released included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Mayors Lindsey Grim of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill at a hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanah.
The disclosure took place some time after the three year-olds interviewed Kavanaugh.
Date of birth: 1 January 2017.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - in no way was responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from the former secretary of the White House Ari Feisecher.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Felischer.
"This suggests that it does not have the status to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The grounds of the accused shall not be questioned.
It shall be calm and seren."
Féscher appeared to have been comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaug's Democrats, who was accused of the criticism that appeared too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will issue to take the seat of Waters in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and to all the members of my staff."
Critics of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, metabolization of a poor hospital
It has now become traditional to seek definitions of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this appears to be applicable to the return of Johnny English-Community metacity of action - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be the opportunity of a new country's export on the subject of obviously how bad we are?
At any rate, the competitors Johnny Englishsh with great eyes and parts of his face moving not as usual had the renewed licence for the second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything shows that it is a widespread complication designed for territories of people who go to the movies that do not speak English.
He is of course the stupendive secret agent who, despite his extraordinary claims to his sweet funeral, has a few of the Clouseau, a meeting of Mr Bean and a large part of that man who contributed a single note to the introduction of the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international man of a mystery who once made his part in Barclaycard TV advertising today, after leaving the caos behind.
There is a beautiful moment or two in the last issue of a JE.
My grandfather was the moment when Johnny English had moved to Elicother while he was wearing gold dresses and the blades of the dancing caught with his helmet for a while.
The origin of Atkinson for the physical media appears, but racism feels quite poor and extremely excessive, especially since "serial" film marks such as 007 and Father Implexible themselves offer the media as an ingredient in a trusted way.
As a result of this activity, the Government of the Republic of Korea has taken the lead in a number of activities in the field of human rights and human rights, including in the field of human rights and human rights.
The official proposal is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
cyber-infiltrating the network was very secreted by British hospitals, by exposing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the work agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the circle on the calls for the prime minister that is a top figure and with difficulties, already suffering from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson makes her best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisers inform it that each active effort has been compromised, will have to bring someone withdrawn.
And this means the competitive Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an eligible building, but gives informal lessons on how to become an infiltrate: a little good joke here as the English offers a School of Rock branding Academy.
English is taken back to Whitehal for emergency meetings and joins his former patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with her submarine commander, the role of one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little loose.
Therefore, both are irreparable to constantly disrupt everything in its Secret Service, returning to action, when they meet the character of a seducious and beautiful Opelia Bullettova interpreted by Olga Krylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the leadership of the billionth of sweet technology that he is able to solve the problems of Britain's computer: Senator Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bogh start their journey of fungus behavior: dress as fairs, give fire to a high French restaurant, create caossettes to get up on Volta's luxury yacht; and English starts a full fervor as he tries to use virtual reality burdens to familiarize himself with the interference of Volta's home.
Surely all stops lead to that last sequence, but amicable and animated as much as he does, has a little idea of children's television.
Something quite moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English I couldn't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a plan for the British to work one week of four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British working for a week of four days – but paid for five.
Allegedly, the party wants the company’s teacher to pass the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them another day a living.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day webcast – but still taking the same wage with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "drive" with the agenda and economic plans of the party that the country is changing in favour of workers.
The switch to a week of four days has been approved by the Trade Unions Congress as a way of taking advantage of the changing economy.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "I expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen today for tomorrow but a week of work of four days is an inspiration that inspires the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party which promised a week of work of four days during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the inspiration is not currently approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Conciliator John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "profitrs" in utility firms.
The opposition channeler's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return their entire share as a Labour government can "reduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Increased Funds to give 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to Ø500.
Lindsey Gram, John Kendy, say to "60 Minutes" if the Kavanah FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his designation for the Supreme Court by week, and raised the question as to whether the findings of the barium could influence a Republican secretary to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the Correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelly asked the Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Gram if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kendy appeared more open than his college by South Carolina.
"Aq, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said and entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanah.
After that happened, after that allegations came out, I said, "Why?"
He was settled, determined, nujovik."
However, the Grim vote seems difficult to change.
"I have already decided about Bert Kavanah and must be a very great accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know it: Brittt flat in the strength," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And any person mentioned cannot verify this.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new."
What is the Global Citize Festival and Do What Has Happened to Reducing Poverty?
The following Saturday New York will host the Global City Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global City Festival will see tens of thousands of people release it to the Central Park Great Lawn to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global City Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project, a group of representation with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was ready to pay a VIP ticket), those who were going to the concert had to end a series of tasks, or "actions" such as voluntary, e-mail to a world leader, make calls or other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global City been with 12 years left to achieve its objective?
The idea of people being rewarded with free conscience is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickt" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "action" from its depositors, which has been pursued for a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced by its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the field.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK of investors and committed implementors that "help children grow for their full potential", promises that Rwanda will be provided with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 videos from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice a footnote to the story," said the ambassador of The Power of Tourism Ulman to the panel during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and a child with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website that asks "What makes you think we can kill extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and against the aparthead, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present it by Debora-Le Furnice and Hug Jackman.
The US uses the Naval fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington may resort to its Naval fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, revealed the United States Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he alleged.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The US has the ability, with our Naval fleet, to ensure that sea tracks are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke has been addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stimulates itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
It continued to compare Washington approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are equally effective.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, little or too, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-skilled" with an economy that depends on carbolated fuels.
The statements come from the fact that the administration of Trump was on mission to strengthen its exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the administration of Trump, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to issue the "inaccurate" gas project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "stor" of Moscow.
Moska has often stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion square metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the intense opposition of Washington to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexandr Novak after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of Germany for industry, the German Industry Federation (BDI), invited the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Conciliator Angela Merkel and the Russian President Valdimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser "Sew Review" If you are released for President in 2020, you will tell the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, Saturday, said that he would be "fully examined" if he would leave for a president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it considers it to come out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, we will examine whether we are going out for a president."
Warren commented about President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was directly in its Trump criticism and his nomination to the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh.
On top of Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation of the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey issued by Thursday showed that a majority of Waren’s own constituents do not think they should be elected in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "prone" voters of Massachusetts said that the sensitator should not come out for election, according to the survey of the University Political Research Centre of Sufolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed further support for election exits by the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential election exits and 48 per cent against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to potential issuances for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vice-President Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Paulin refers to the PSD of Tick Paulin at the event of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, killed one year in Iraq after it was registered in September
He was arrested and put on a domestic violence incident at night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning, I can relate to other families who feel the horrors of the PSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience in an exhibition for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahura.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that nobody is addressing" and said about her son and other prisoners of war, "they return a little different, return stronger, try to think if there is such respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wissala, Alaska, and put on an attack on a woman's domestic violence, while he was involved in a report of domestic violence and armed possession while he was on his way, according to Dan Bennet, spoke to the Police Department of Wassila.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge for a new asylum policy
eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge for a new United States policy to deny asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and district, Friday brought a case of a court friend in Washington to support a person seeking asylum who is challenging policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace v. Sesions, which submitted the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as the nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals which has allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Advocate-General of the Columbia Karl Racine District, said that the new policy "to mark decades of state, federal and international law."
Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a reason violates this principle, said the case of a court friend.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy of denying entry to immigrants would harm the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
The Attorney-General Jeff Sesions ordered immigration judges to cease giving asylum to victims who escaped domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sesion said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Rescue forces deployed in Paul as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find supersites
For experts, the situation has become increasingly alarming.
"A very intense feeling," said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, holding her daughter a baby with a fever in a centre of evacuation in the comfort city of Paul.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
The clean water is dark."
The residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, to seek in their watered affairs, to try to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the earthquake of 7.5 size, were overfilled.
Some of the injuries, including Dow Haris, who suffered a breach in their appearance and in his splenic, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated abroad due to ongoing strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told him that he felt the violent earthquake moving the land of the hotel in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed with the wall ruins, I think," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
Week after the Chinese official newspaper released a four-page broadcast on a US daily newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing that used the American press to spread propaganda.
President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper most sold in the state of Ioa - after accusing China seeking to enter into the US Congress elections of 6 November, accused China of breaking up.
The charge of Trump that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections marked what the US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an ongoing trade war which they saw passing tariff rounds on imports of each of them.
China's irreversibility fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Ioa which supported the Republic of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brandt, the US Ambassador for China and the former governor of Ioa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing injured workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad on an opinion page in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is now doubleing this blog by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of his propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved tradition of America of free expression and free press by putting a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brand.
"In contrast, on the stand of the newspapers down the road here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media is found under a restriction of the Chinese Common Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper.
The Republicans Members Members of Women before the Mid-Term Sessions by Kavanah Debate, Guest the Analysts
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending the President of the Supreme Court Brettt Kavanaut while facing various allegations of sexual assault, the analysis warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next half-term elections.
The hearings on this were very high, and most of the Republics are already showing that they wanted to conduct the vote officially.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Recher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Church University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
It appeared to doubt that the thrust of the last minute of Senator Jeff Falke (R-Arizona) for an investigation of the FBI will be sufficient to beat angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened tomorrow -- they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speakers for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
The morning, the protestors beat up "Nov September!" as they proposed in the Senate hall as soon as the Republics that are controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the statement of Dr. Christine Bassey Ford, reported Mike.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said St. Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying that they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, in particular between women voters who change vote in the sub-groups and smaller voters, aged 18 to 29, while they do not please the president, often not vote."
In the light of the above, the Commission considers that there is a need for the Commission to take into account the fact that it is not in a position to do so.
"This has become a full lecture for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This concerns not only the voting of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republics handled this situation and how they dealt with it," I pointed out to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorites USA, a group that helps to free the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanah declarations, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the respondents believed definitely or probably the Ford declaration, while 35 per cent said that they definitely believed or probably the Ford declaration.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanah probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the deployment by Falke, the FBI is currently investigating allegations submitted by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
He was brought to the attention of the Judicial Committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaugh was in a position to attack him at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the President of the Supreme Court had expressed his genetics to her while they were in a festival when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Burners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, will launch a new business seeking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology race project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Corners-Le open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Le has made it clear that the intention after Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We need to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their "own online data shop" or POOD.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Clark and Spotify are all available on one and all at the same time.
What makes a single personal online data store is that it is entirely in the hands of the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls this a personal autonomisation by data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, practical skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by an IBM, some practitioners in staff with a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned below today for tomorrow.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Bernards-Le wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Le transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Union at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Le was a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Union, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm amazingly optimistic for this next generation of the web," added Berners-Le.
Bernard Vann: Celebrate Clerical of the Ccross Victoria World War I
The only priest of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehocourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
The Saturday was obtained from both of his neutrons in a parallel in Rushden, Northamtonshire.
One of his vices, Michael Vann, said that it was "symbolically symbolic" that the stone had to be revealed exactly 100 years after the win of the victory of the Nanuh.
According to London Gazate, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kur led his Battalion to the other side of Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many degrees and fires from blocks on the ground and machines."
Later he speeded for the fire line and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before going to a ride on the ground alone and lost consciousness of three of the troops.
The Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that Nathan's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very minimal."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a girland after the paragraph, which was led by the Brentwood Youth Board.
Michael Vann said that he was "feeling very honored that he played a role in this paragraph" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA items remained up all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, I've been awakened all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end off seeing the main event.
The list from San José included 13 battles, including six on the main card and were being shown directly during the night in the United Kingdom on Chanel 5.
On 6am, as George Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom remained silent when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they remained up to the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to children's carton as "some kind of golf joke."
"It's a government regulation that on 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the island," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker said that they will work on their schedule to include future United Kingdom television viewers.
"I think when I think about repetition, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But now there they're the sixth morning of Sunday and we won't be able to adjust until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emminis, when the broadcast turned, there were many ongoing messages and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, thinking it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can tell you that next time you won't happen.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six - as we do the usual - and tried to deliver more to the supporters and instead to go too far.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic count Tom Daley says that it grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave the motivation to make a success.
The 24-year-old man said he had not realized until with the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Dissert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give to others "the hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in him than in winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the long-standing programme, Christy Young, took a few months to Frank because of illness.
While it appeared as a fugitive on the first Laverne programme, Daley said that he felt "less than anyone else" he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to please the boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those emotions that you feel less than, and you feel different, were the true things that gave me the power and strength that I could succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", said he, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually became aware of his sexuality.
The Olympic bronchist twice became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt that he could live freely without regrets and wanted to give to others a "fulfilment".
The winner of the world for three times said that when he became a man - a film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised" for him.
Daley married the winner of Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When he passed through so many things so young-- he went to his first Olympics 14 years old and his father died with cancer three years later-- he said that it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"I wish I had finished last year, for me the important was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than Olympic gold media.
The medal of my Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if they had already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say 'I'm not going to be here to be in the front row, Paul'," he said.
"I was holding him back when he stopped breathing and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and it was dead that I finally recognized that it was indistinct," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the Olympics of 2012 and won the bonus.
"I knew that this was what I created all my life -- that we nursed before a crowd from countries in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first choice of his song - Heather Small's present - which was compatible with him in the walk for the Olympics and still match the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson no longer in shape on the bank in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will record the Saturday when he plays his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form to avoid being an important stage that is not so happy.
Mikkelson, who plays at the biannual event for a 12-fold record, remained on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as was often for the United States, the great winner of five times his day between being supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope of correcting what concerns him.
One who never gave the ball right even in the face of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long edge distance one time later replaces wrong errors.
And if the course alone is not enough to cut the heart, Mikkelson, in the ninth Sunday game, faces the exact lead of the British Open Francesco Molinary, which has joined Tommy Fletwood, new to the season, to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below the start of the 12th single game, start well, the Mikkelson game can show it to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tap me on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"We have much confidence in himself.
He Hall of Famer and contributed much to these teams in the past, and this week.
It was unlikely that I would see him play two parts.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought we'd go.
He must be out there, like others."
Mikkelson will exceed the record of Nick Faldo for the most important parts of the Ryder Cup that was played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career which has quite never achieved its optional record millions.
Mikkelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"He wears you, scans, folks, likes to kiss you with people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players took a pleasure to criticize him, this week, which was something different to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European leader Thomas Bjorn who can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European master, knows from experience that a front position set before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed on a comfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valdarma, where one side led by Seve Balesteros maintained an advantage of five points on the Americans but ended with a narrow true margin, with a win of 141.13.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a big front position in Valderama; we had a big front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Philadelphia, where we won, but with a little,," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class winning 5-3 on both Friday and Sundays to be on a 10-6 on Le Gold National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that has not yet finished everything.
You're still going with yourself and your body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It has not yet finished everything until you have drawn the points on the team.
We have a purpose, and what we try to hide this trophy, and the focus remains there.
I've always said, focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but I know well what the other side is -- the biggest players in the world."
Be pleased with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "Never go step or step with me in this.
A different challenge remains.
It concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when there's out individually, then you're being tested for your full capacity as a golf.
This is the message you want to pass on to players, to get your best out tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he must leave and leave his best, too."
In contrast to Byron, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they made partners, with the exceptions that they Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before Europe did the "Medinah ministry."
"I remember at least a word from her," he said in a reply when he was asked how Ben Creshaw, the master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important items, but you want to give it to that beginning as soon as you've seen in Brookline, as you've seen in Medina.
When it comes to that momentum on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle items.
We brought our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, knowing you, trying to do some miracles tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIllary in the best game, with Paul Cay, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole way," said Byron on his singles choices.
The new war of Germany postponed again
The most new brand of the German Naval fleet had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old-age trailers in the Great War, but there will not be at least until next year due to systems with increasing defects and costs, reported local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brands, has now been postponed for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military speaker.
The vessel was to join the Naval fleet in 2014, but the problem issues following the delivery of the ambitious project's destination.
The four Baden-Wüerttemberg class vessels that ordered the Naval fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class traders.
It is understood that they will have a strong canon, an exhibition of missiles against aircraft and against ships as well as some caustic technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and austic symptoms.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest brands for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the last technology vessels - which are mentioned - allow Germany to project power outside its shores - will already be old on the moment when they enter service, notice Die Zeit.
The F125 poor-forward brand appeared in the news last year, when the German Naval fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media quoted a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship dead if deployed on a compliance mission.
The software defects were particularly important as soon as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class trailers.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel was heavily burdensome to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval fleet to increase future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice more heavy than vessels of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to a defective hardware, the full project price - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this has reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) – from €2.2 billion initial.
The problems of the most new brands become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Naval fleet currently has "a lack of ships to cope with deployment."
The official said that the problem has grown over time, as old ships have been commissioned but replacement vessels have not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wüerttemberg class honourers could join the Naval fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of the bats at night
New research on the ground in the Scotland Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of unique mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pistrelelles and soprano as well as brown bats with long ears and Daubenton in the Inverwenet in Western Ross.
Special vouchers will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-hold detectors.
An expert analysis of all records sounds will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species is doing what.
A habitat map will then be produced and a report that will create a detailed picture of their landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how best to keep the trees for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and around the United Kingdom decreased considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting buildings and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, such as speed cards to capture insects and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not currently blind.
However, because of the traditions of hunting their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch prey.
They use sophisticated greening techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when they fly.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the butterfly very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, hospital inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and the only reserve of the Scotland bats in the Land Threave in Dumfries and Gallowy, which welcomes eight of the 10 species of Scotland bats at night.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is their ideal territory.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for the bats tonight," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterinary trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much more about the bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to do."
It stresses the importance of checking the bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that an unintentional destruction of a single maternity house could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly killing a whole local population.
The bats at night are protected and is illegal to kill, design or suppress or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Swiss Security Trust Officer for the Highway Conservation, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We have much to learn about our bats tonight and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as the lawyers are ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out claims of rape against him as "false news", by saying that people would be "promoting themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to search by court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The front player of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing an American woman, named Catherine Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that at that time he had paid $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Dr Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagrim Live with 142 million of his followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, pointed out the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or for five times while looking at the camera.
"They must promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything will go well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek court for Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they call "inadmissible reporting of suspects in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Dr Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in Discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly studied it by the anus, according to documents submitted at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Myorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent" "good man" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but that it was by consensus.
Myorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to a solution outside the court because she felt "distorted by retaliation" and was concerned that "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to change the solution as soon as it is being cultured by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo had arrived to join Real Madrid by Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer followed the Italian football race juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom is "resolved" that has lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will always regret” if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Business Secretary Gre Clark.
He added that it was of "warming" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it temporarily stopped production in its factory in Branaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement would cost employment.
The Bernaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Coke, the director director of Toyota in Branaston.
Other United Kingdom manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jagur Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Minni plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
The production line of Toyota today works on the basis of "timely actual", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars made by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be a border disruption that the industry says could lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a more than-day inventory at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production is stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Chequers plan of Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "calculated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We need to have the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only the success of enjoying this present but also the opportunity to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a large set of successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production was stopped, but in a longer period, warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked in Branaston for 24 years and is the defendant of the United Union in the plant, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A government speaker said: "We have a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "remained by another week" as the fight continued on the Premier of the Supreme Court, Bertt Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein takes care of the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump and Russia's aid and potential block of justice by the president.
If Trump is to expel a general lawyer or not, thereby jeopardising Muller's independence, he has been forced to hire Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wires to record exchanges with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which at that time was in the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefer" would not expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a breach with the hearing of the justice committee of the Senate in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave evidence.
As a result of the investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, Trump issued an order to the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed further full vote of the Senate.
Sunday, the press secretariat of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When questions were asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "She has not been set a date for this, it may be held this week, and may be held the following week because of all other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the up-to-date picture."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders has not organised a press meeting at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of gratitude with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture would be increased.
"The president holds more sessions of Questions and Answers compared to any president who had agreed," she added without quoting any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "If the picture has the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, this is much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the municipalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves in a calm and sometimes harsh manner before groups of journalists.
The health secretary will write to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country they remain behind the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when the United Kingdom left less than six months to leave the EU.
The Slovak Government has already committed to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its evolving public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "By summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit, which are moving towards expected decisions this summer.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Friends from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and they benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and I want you very much to stay here."
Christion Abercromie Conducts Emergency surgery After Injury in Rassa
The lineback Christion Abercromie of the Tensey State Tigers conducted emergency surgery following an injury in the head of the Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Computers by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennse.
The main state coach Tensey Road Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the Hitler.
"He went on the sideline and like falling down there," said Reed.
The training and medical staff gave the oxygen to Abercromie on the sideline before they placed it on a starter and took it back for further examination.
A State official of Tensey told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennicee, that Abercromie was not yet operating at the Central Medical Centre of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "so far there is no detail on the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennesse is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercromie, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tenncie after leaving Illinois.
The Saturday in total he had five taxis before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 taxis of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more on the Blue Tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged more on the ball tax when buying property in the UK with surplus money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on non-taxables in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise up up to –120 million a year – to help people without a home
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher ball tax rate when they buy property in the UK - with extra money used to help people without home.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target high payers.
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with surplus money boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current ball tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental-purpose purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to –120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, who are increasing prices and thus becoming more difficult for new buyers to make the first step in the purchase phase of housing.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become "fantasy cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the ball tax so that more young people would be helped to buy their first home.
He accused the large construction firms that were maintaining high property prices by taking up the land and not using it, and urged Ms May to base allowances on affordable homes in order to correct the "accommodation of housing elderly" situation in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms that touch the eye, including controls on rent and the end of "free-of-torn" dismissals.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "It was last year that I said that I would dedicate my post to returning the dream of the United Kingdom - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means adjusting the broken market of our accommodation.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and find their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy as many houses as UK needy residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the indignity of sleeping in the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Ross says that his "core ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland once.
The 42-year-old Swedish welcomes the challenge of re-raising the Greek club, which is currently located in the third place in the League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This summer is moving to Stadium of Light after guiding St Midin back to the Isctash Premiership in the last season.
"I've been playing for countries as a player.
I got B cap and nothing more," Ross told the Scotland BBC Sportfound.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hamden, and it always lasts the thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if we succeed in managing a club."
Former Roses as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such names set up in such a large club, while he had previously refused the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
"But now, the success for me will be based on "notable again" this club for Premier League?"
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I can take it back to the club there."
Ross has only been in his career as manager, after a period of an assistant head in Dombarton and after he spent 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the race to the third category, and transformed St Miren from the edge of the race to the winners of the title of Campionate in the following season.
And Ross says that now they feel more comfortable than he would have felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkrick, St Miren and Hamilton Acadical.
As to when he took Alola into his hand, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"Generally, I thought that the manager's office was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This can be heard by moving well, having a decent living, and enjoying reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I simply feel that the manager's post is suitable for me.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing this, and I feel that throughout my entire adult life now I feel the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pump is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave has boosted the profit of the UK pubs which are in difficulty but has put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, the pool groups and bars saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales - but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA of business advice, which collected figures, said: "Further work and longer participation of England than expected in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month of June, when the sale of books increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The flats and bars the main sales of which are drinks were the ones most well spent in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
The main sales of them are food also saved in heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food dropped to 3 percent."
Paul Newman, one of the RSM analysis regarding entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the pattern we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or sport remain the largest factors in terms of sales on the take-ways market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent a year after one year will in particular be a heavy burden other than continuous cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come at a shorter time for operators whose main sales are food and only the time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide the necessary rest."
The growth of total sales in books and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Ticker industry for the money, bars and restaurant sector of the United Kingdom collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than 9 billion, and is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hiding from their parents
Survey reveals that one in five children - some of them at 11 - have secret social media accounts hiding from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "Insta fooz" pages.
News has great fears of putting sexual content into place
Twenty percent of students said they had "first" to show their parents
One in five children - some at 11 years of age - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta fooz" accounts - a reference to the site for the sharing of Instagrim photos.
News has great fears of putting sexual content into place.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a "first" account available to show their parents, while having other private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old child secret site found a young woman who was urging others to study it - "supran me."
Research, from Digital Awards UK and the Highmasters and Headmistresses (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 years had two profiles, half of which admitted to maintaining private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are preparing to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elydh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Slovak Atlantic panel.
Elydh Doyle was elected to the Slovak Atlantic Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the course and not of the course who won the medals and President Ian Beatie described this change as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Elidh is very respected in the Slovak, UK and world exchange community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beatie.
Doyle said: "We are eager to act as a voice for the athletes and hope that I can really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland."
The United States, which won the 200 metre and 400 metre in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and is now a regular BBC critical, is not moving after having suffered a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today, one month gives me a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover.
It was a task of fighting but I recovered completely, I learned how to re-establish and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thanks to the message of encouragement!"
Reklam of the breast pump comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different online opinions
A breast pump company has given rise to different online opinions with a reklam comparing breast-feeding mothers with cattle being released.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the first breast pump in the world that can be worn and that does not make noise " , the technological company of the consumer Elvie released a video inspired by an ironic music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers burn in a jar filled with the straw of cattle with a disc which includes a liqueur such as: "Yes, I'm letting myself down but I don't have a tail" and "In case I didn't recognize them, they're not a horse but a sire."
The corus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm hoping for my babies, pumping it out, pumping it out, I'm letting my wives out."
However, the advertising published on the company Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 inspectors and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from the viewers, many of whom claim to shed light on the "territory" of the milk industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows were used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "And I understand that this is a most exciting thing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "It really is cut off from the reality."
Others defended the film, with a woman admitted to finding the disc "very diverse."
"I think this is a collective idea.
If I had been breast - feeding, I would have bought one.
The pumping would have made me feel the same as a reader.
The riclam is a little or too paradise but I have taken it.
This is a genetic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a playful talk aimed at the mothers who play (mainly on their places of work or in the toilets) and feel like "the cows".
This is not an excuse to praise or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discover that they were all burning with pumps that do not give in to the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their hands say they feel like cattle.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in breast-feeding without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave while they are running.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD in Moster commented: "Elvie Pump is a sordidistic product that it was necessary to launch a courageous and provisional launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump with the dairy cows, we want to pay attention to all the breast pumping and the challenges it brings, showing differently and in a way that can be related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catalogue for the designer Martha Jacobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migratory Children Walk Without Words towards the Texas Border Day Camp
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed too much, in part because of the harsh territorial and policies introduced by Trump administration that have made it more difficult to put children together with a sponsor.
Traditionally, many Sponkers were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they made themselves to take care of a child would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other adult members of their municipality would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albance, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed before Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who applied to co-sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Some 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the home of a sponsor are illegally located here in the country, many of which are foreign criminal.
So we continue to seek these individuals," said Mr Albance.
In order to make the process involving children faster, officials have introduced new rules which will require that some of them appear in court within one month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the works of the servers.
Many will appear through a video telephone conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly reported.
According to Al-Qiter workers and the reports that emerged from the system in recent months, more often with children being held in custody, it is more likely that they will become anxious or contaminated, which may lead to violent expressions or to try to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns increase in a larger facility such as Toronto, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is experiencing difficulty, due to the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the town of tandem without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their partners could lead to a trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey "occupant forces" to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Mowalem, who also served as deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian territory, with the issue of the fight against terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mowalem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost at its end" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died, with millions more moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this secret battle until we have been removed from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the land in the war-stricken country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moyam said that the conditions were right for them to return, and stuck "in some Western countries" for "rural fears" that led refugees to keep them away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major strong rebellion of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moalem stressed that the agreement had "extreme deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would target the journalists including the war against North Front linked to Al-Qaida, which "will be destroyed".
UN messenger Stephan de Mitura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mowalem has established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, by saying that the work of the panel should be restricted "for the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Mandatory
In this logic, in 2020, Mr Trump will win the re-election provided that, as many free television, denouncing and calendars are hoping to end his presidency sooner.
What will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic fine that has ever been in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that the viewers have not yet appeared.
Since 2014, the time ratings with the largest number of televisioneters have increased by more than twice to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million televisioneter in time with the largest number of televisions, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and the MSNBC "Rachel Madow Show" has increased cable television ratings by up to 3.5 million televisioneters in key news fields.
"This is a situation that attracts people to it because it's not something we understand," said Neal Bauer, presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designated Survivo", about a cabin secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of the Vatican Commissions and author of "Just the Fonny Parks: And a Few Hard Truths Abboting Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He is a member of the Taliban and is a member of the Russian Federation.
The driver said he would vote Mr Trump.
Why? asked she.
"He said, "Why have you strengthened me," said Ms. Scovell.
In this case there is a value of entertainment.
On the contrary, the stories of the stories from Washington can undoubtedly determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a lousu that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And however, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of a "deep background" source for his book "Fear", the food skin bumber package ("expressive clothing", said The Washington Post) of Paul Manfort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomics from Stromy Daniel.
I, for example, will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what it's doing as if it's realy tea is that every night it's going to bring you something," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive of Wehelhouse Interior and the Creator of "Pwon Stars", on the changing case and the development in the daily fleet of the Trump programme (at N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you will otherwise fall back.
When I contacted Mr Felis this week, outside the weather, the sun was at 80 degrees in the North Coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside to see MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not be released from front of the television, not when there was Bert Kavanah ready to face the Supreme Court's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we had previously done those exciting programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation," said Mr. Felis.
"I thought it was some joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of out-of-the-art cash in the mid-term election of White House
It is not surprising that the 17 Congolese districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of Congolese districts which have acquired two operators in a race for the same chair.
This has recently re-established the Suburban District of Pittsburg the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republic of Cheith Rothfu, currently representing the twelve old districts of Pennsylvania, which extend much to the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were played in an anti-constitutional way in favour of the Republics.
The race in the 17th new district provided a difficult contest of the financial campaign between the arms of the main party, the Democratic Campagn Congressional Commission (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic campaign) and the National Republic of Camping Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a family name in Pennsylvania after winning with a little difference in the special election of March followed by a lot for the eighteenth Congional District of Pennsylvania.
That chair was of the Republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political criticisms have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States is about to punish El Salvador Tali Support China, then decided not to do this
The Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with some help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held an adequate meeting with President Juan Carlos Varla of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners left the administrative team of Trump.
The officials of the State Department decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama again on the " Recent decisions to cease to recognise Taiwan", said the speakers of the Heather Nauret department, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in American aid, including nuclear controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As the internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central America officials opposed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly critical to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration being placed on the meeting, said the diplomas.
And the three Americans sent returned with trouble in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or punishment and hard by Washington.
Mr Bulton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a close-to-management foreign analyser and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Muller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress will move to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible for that body, as he prepares to return to the voters, and perhaps eventually a peer jury.
This involves many uncertainties, and I do not have the aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent to which the fight is prolonged.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to carry out a co-up d'état against Hitler, which if the West had held him and supported the Czechs in Muach.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre.
The course of history turns to such points of inflation, and the inexhaustible run of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr Trump removes Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he has suggested that the president be secretly registered and in a spectrum that is inappropriate for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said that the report of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we answer if the new investigation of the F.B.I. requested by Bert Kavanaug is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual behaviour and a disonest witness?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for Congress who will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a shift in democracy.
But I believe that I will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
Mother was a Czech Jew who was reported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She succeeded in living, moving to the United States and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to perform the candles on that table with statistics.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Grand Dorrans of Rangers is an optimist before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the awareness that the victory against Austria, following the impressive equal outcome that they brought in Spain against Villerreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group.
An injury in the knee predisposed to the mifelder Gram Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season an equal result of 2-2 with Villerreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villareral is a good team," said the 31-year-old journalist.
"We came to the game with the belief that we were able to get something and get us out with a point.
It is likely that we won the final but, everything, an equal result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a big European night again.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good outcome in their last game but, with the panel behind us, I feel sure that we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, between everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is currently a sense of optimism.
The team is good and the boys are having great pleasure; the steering is doing well.
I hope that now we can do our utmost, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are worried about this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to do so, few people were talking to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the subjects in the Nationweide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a member of the family to hire them, but they don't take the steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the business on the life of the Nationalweed.
You should start that way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a value of hybrid money to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal questions.
Find a guardian of healthcare to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider pro rata for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are disabled.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergys?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"They are not the only finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will care for the dog?
See that plan is ready."
A male has been hit several times by a number of airbrows in Iifracombe
A man was hit several times by a flow of air raids as he walked to his home after night outside.
The victim, who has been in his 40th year, was in the Exford Grove area of Iifrafcombe, Devon, when he was hit by a mirror in his home, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Terremotes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palo in Indonesia on Friday, the officers said, with the expected number of deaths increasing.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid measure is compatible with the internal market and that it is compatible with the internal market.
In Paul, more than 16,000 people were mined after the disaster.
The following are some key facts about Paul and Dongala, on the island of Solawesi:
Palo is the capital city of the Central province of Solawesi, located at the end of a narrow sea on the west coast of the island of Solawesi, with a population of around 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a reference extending over 300 km (180 m) of the coast to the north-west of the island of Solawesi.
The presence, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Solawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moroli, on the coast of Sulaysi on the other side.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Dongala.
In 1996, tsunamis also killed nine people on the western side of Dongala.
Indonesia is situated on the Ring of the Semitic Pacific Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a great earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia at the top of Sumatra triggered tsunamis that killed 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Strong earthquake series hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Terremot with a force of 6.8 hit the south of Java, which is the most popular island of Indonesia, which took up tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a power of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital city of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Terremot with a power of 7.5 hit one of the Metawai islands, off Sumatra, which took up tsunamis with a height of 10 metres that destroyed tens of birds and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake struck the absence of Pide Jaya in Aceh, which caused the destruction and panic as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and fatal tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were installed, but more than 100 were killed because of the buildings it carried.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
Smaller of Sarah Pauline Arstat on Domestic Violence Cases
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of the Americas and the presidential vice president Sarah Pallin, was arrested on attack charges.
Paulin, aged 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, who interfered in a report of domestic violence and who resisted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Asian State Troopers on Saturday.

Terremot and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Solawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks do not work with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just a little out of the centre of Solawesi located in the Greek of the capital of Indonesia, Jakar.
Videos showing the moment of impact are broadcast on the media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal Prosecutors are requesting the suspected terrorist attack of NYC to be punished with a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York request that Seyfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, kill eight people who have been sentenced to death - rare punishments that have not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot lease truck to carry out a road attack for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhatan, as in October showering to the displaced persons and cyclists we sow on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intently" killed the eight victims and "intently" caused serious physical injuries, in accordance with the notice of intention to request the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of charges carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 heads of the charges which included eight cases of murder with the help of organised relapse, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When they described the way in which Saipov carried out this attack "Family, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial planning and meditation".
The notice of intention states that "Syfullo Habiblavic Sapov caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laure Deakt, Daren Drakke, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aljandro Damian Pangnuco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last case of a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers but finally in September 2009 was sentenced to prison sentences.
The last time the death penalty was committed in a federal case of New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after they were found guilty of inspiration to carry out an examination for the Soviet Union during the Bierda War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of restorations in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he thought well about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was intent on carrying out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the chief of the charges.
He also prayed for a flag to be placed in his hospital room of ISIS, said the police.
He replied not guilty to 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "surely disappointed" with the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than to accept a cause of guilt for prison life with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
The defence team of Saipov has previously asked the prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage has promised that he will "mobilise the army of the people."
The former Head of the Ukip said that politicians had to "feel them under pressure" from the Euroxits - as suggested by one of the MPs of Theresa May itself that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the Government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would so far have been "issued" if Mr Farage were Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her very divided positions was highlighted by Tories, not in favour of Brexit, who joined a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers’ compromise plan on the right path among the attacks by Brexiera, against the Brexit and the EU.
The Alleviants insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward in trying to reach agreement with Brussels - and will force the Eurostics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "caus".
Mr Bone said to the Royal Leaves Leave in Solohull that he wanted to "get off the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be friends so far," he said.
The MP Wellingbook added: "I will defend the Brexit but need to abandon the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he is against the EU, he said: "We have not fought a world war to be civil.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their understanding and must remain not absolutely true."
Andrea Jenkins, Brexitira of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, in which she told journalists: "I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Non-Popular Chequers Plan with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who are in fact those who go on the streets and who have never voted for us.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start hearing."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians should "feel them under pressure" if they were going back from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to go back from the Brixt and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let you walk if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiast crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from the Brexit.
We are immobilising the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, those against Brexit moved to Birmingham before they made a 2-hour round in the city centre.
Following the launch of the group this showend, a small number of activists visited bankers in writing Tories Agienst Brexit (Tories Against the Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, has been ridiculed to the Conservatives for the security issues which they have suffered with an app of the party as soon as the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and all technology for Canada and more, for the undistorted border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full horse.
The idea of Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "exactly examine" the possibility of issuing for the presidential election
The United States says that after the November elections, "the possibility of issuing for the presidential election will be carefully examined".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critical of President Donald Trump, will issue for a re-election in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Dihal, who was a co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of the speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holioke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of debate with municipal citizens since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her whether she intended to go out for the presidential election.
Warren answered that it was time "that women go to Washington to reform our fragmented government, which includes a woman at the top."
He was arrested in connection with murder with the shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the killing by shooting the LSU bandetball Syms player that took place on Friday.
The Department of the Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m. ET News conference.
Week they issued a shooting video, where they asked for help to identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed by a fly near the campus of the University of South in the morning.
According to 247 sports, Saturday the head of police Murphy J. Paul said to the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a wound caused by a shooting in a head and eventually died as a result of this."
Wede came to defend his friend and was hit by a fly from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, who had a weapon, and admitted that he fired on the Wede Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and held in custody at the Police Department of Parish Baton Rouge East.
Sims, a young man who had six feet and who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 spots last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton approaching to get the world title after orders of his team gave him the victory vis-à-vis Sebastian Vetel
The Saturday, from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified before Louis Hamilton, it was clear that the orders of the Merceds team would have an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vittel to attack his partner.
Viteel was the first to enter the stop zones and left Hamilton hanging with others in the final location of the group, something to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another turn and came out just after Vetel, but Hamilton continued following a few round action with a bike which led to the Froar driver leaving the inside of the free side of the free of charge due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first turn at the close of his years at the age of 21.
Then he was in front of most of the race by not changing his tyres with a view to quickly completing and exceeding Kimi Raicconen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in 44 turns but could not increase his pace in the eight turns he had remained while Raicconen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did his very good job throughout the whole showand it was a real tent saying to me by.
The team did a very extraordinary job to get the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
What Was A Fission Really Bad
President Donald Trump withdrew for ridicule to Vice-President Diane Feinstein on the Saturday in connection with her indistinctness that she did not seek the letter from Christine Blasy Ford that she was accusing the designated person of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh with sexual assault.
When he spoke in a roll in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the witnesses given by Ford before the Presidency of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vili and disproved and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and disgruntled and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and a knowledge of information and then say "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you found any information?
Remember her answer... I got the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, she did not.
I didn't know anything."
See, wait a minute.
We knew... No, we didn't know," he added, while I came to the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter giving details of the allegations against Kavanah by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from its office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not explain her history," said Feinstein to the committee, report The Hill.
"I asked to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she had asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who during the Saturday evening party commented: "You know what I know, that what was physically really wrong.
It may not have been, but that's the worst physical impact you've ever seen."
The President, while continuing his defence of the designated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, suggested that the Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power by any necessary means.
They are seeing the reality, the desruptia, they don't care who hurt, who wears it on the wheels to get power and control," said the president according to reports by Mediate.

Air Traffic Controler Dead to Ensure that hundreds of people on the Ikkun Airport can escape the Tremot
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people is able to safely land.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a great earthquake hit the island of Solawesi Friday, which started tsunamis.
Strong forces continued to occupy the area and many were caught in dabris in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled for survival, the 21-year-old journalist Antonio Guanayan Agong refused to leave his position in the control tower he was running at the airport of Pal, Mutira Sis Al Jupri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which at that time was in the track, could be safely left.
He then exceeded the traffic control tower when he thought it was running.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johnnes City, said that the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Paul.
"When we hear about it I feel a big window," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the drain while many could not reach," said the speaker of the Sutopo Pureo Nugroho agency.
The waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Paulo on Sunday will become mass ends.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance entered the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-marks are traversing everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Creed Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already tragic, but it can worsen."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Wiyodo, arrived in Palestine on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work night and day to complete every task related to evacuation.
Report the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Incentive of an aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is dead after the aircraft accident in the lake
The airline that was operating a flight flying in Pacific lakes in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, after saying that 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the burning plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one male passenger was.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately attract requests for further passenger details, such as its age or nationality.
The local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when he tried to land at the airport of Chouk Island.
On Friday, officials said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline claimed that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the US Naval fleet both said that the Irish aircraft in Lagos is a little away from the track.
Some witnesses thought the aircraft exceeded the track.
The American passenger Bill Jayans said that the plane entered very low.
"This is really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that had been high to old times until the emergency came out on the plane that was sinking.
He said that flight assistants were fighting and crying, and that he suffered a minor injury in his head.
The US Naval fleet said that seafarers who were working closely to improve a moll also helped to save by using an open boat to carry passengers to the shore before the aircraft grew in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Date from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 persons died in incidents of airlines registered with PNG but no incidents involved Air Niugini.
Analist presents a schedule of the night on which a woman was burned alive
It concluded its evidence of the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman by his father in 2014.
The Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett has been witnessing for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile records to gather information on the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night that he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in the city at that time.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said that that night it was in the truck of Sanford, Sanford said that he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another intolerance was that Telis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hep Hup aware?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claims that the hip hop has moved beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the popular hiphop again.
Artists such as The Fujes and Common have seen a recent re-arrangement in the United Kingdom with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Nanny from NY escapes a couple who left it after a message "racist"
Nancy from New York is running a couple for discriminatory dismissal after he received a message by the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the case with "exploratory."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-bearing person, Giselle Maurice, was a dark trailer when she arrived at the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEE PERSON OTHER SEWADA", wrote Ms Placeco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noting her worst error, Plasco-Faxman felt "screw" and ran away to Ms Maurice, where she said that her former nony, an African-American, had not done her well and that instead she was waiting for Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is releasing the couple for compensation in respect of the expulsion, and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, can't do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they were racist, saying that the expulsion of Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they defended her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Pasco to Post.
"But if you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke with the Goff, even if it was by mistake?
Your baby?
And let's go."
When he compared the case with "exploration", Placeco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and was found "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like this?
It's not something nice to do," he added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rapidly announced to the couple the social media, where they have resulted in their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not relate to talkers
The girl of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It is very true that we now know what we know about the great success of Padington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC aclerman before he was inspired to write the book of the children from small games, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "a pleasure but had suffered some sorrow" after his death last year.
About Padington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he had never been able to talk about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with it myself," she said.
"But since Padington was so real to him, it was like when you have a child to get something: be proud of them even if it isn't you who've got something.
I think he was looking at the success of Padington in that way.
Although he was his creation and his imagination, he always gave the merit to Padington himself."
Home was dying and I had to give her the last kiss on the phone
As soon as she was called her daughter was immediately taken to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked to save her life but it was all for nothing.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperhouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last kiss.
And so did I.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
Be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were decreasing and allowing her system to slow down.
She had died a little before and started to roll everything up.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all of this was happening.
I could not cry or cry or cry by being surrounded by families and people.
I'd be real back."
In the end, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far been crying for the loss of her daughter, went to the plane together with the other passengers - who did not know the difficult situation it was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low fever, and the tears began to fall all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we would stay.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of uncleaned women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspired messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Ms Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer with depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her daughter was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile was burning in every room."
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was in "very dark place."
In 2014, my brother Taylor, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said, "I am afraid this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davies created the cards, "to inform people that you can open up to them or meet them, even if they are a friend.
Do not put into silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not too much after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"After a few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas day it was very bad – when the children opened their hotels did not make any contact with them with his eyes or something like this.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they wanted to fight her: "Let me go empty in the family.
Do not freeze.
But all of us want to continue with our lives and fight."

The future of Bert Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI initiates an investigation
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked -- a limited investigation in time, limited in purpose -- we might have brought a little unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "sweeping" among a party pioneer who grew root.
Why did Mr Kavanah and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their return is due as a whole to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will severely weaken their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was gathering the phone to call the Sanitaries, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where they currently hold a position of 51 Republics and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "sweep" under Kim
The number of North Korean explorers for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korea legislator.
When quoting data from the Ministry for South Sea unification, Park Byong-seug said last year there were 1,127 changes in the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates required by human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North-West Deservers are eventually offered South Korea citizenship.
In addition, the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have taken the lead in the implementation of the Agreement on Security and Security Council Resolutions on the implementation of Security Council Resolutions Nos.
Many of them escape from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross in comparison to the Demililarised Area (DMZ) very protected between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often send them back to their country by force.
The relations between the North and the South Sea – which remain technically at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on the timing of the deneuklearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho has fixed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to remove the weapons unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosis calls Bert Kavanaugh "sterical", while saying that he is unable to work at the Supreme Court
The Leaders of the Chamber of Nancy Pelosis called the candidate to the Supreme Court Mr Bert Kavanaugh "sterical" and said he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
According to the information provided by the French authorities, the Commission did not provide any evidence that the measures were in force on the basis of Article 107(1) of the basic Regulation.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman had ever acted in that way, they would have said "sterial", said Pelos about her reaction to the Kavanaug's testimony before the Judicial Committee of the Thursday Sea.
Kavanah emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Bassey Ford when both were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even crying and burning when he was talking about his family and the years of his secondary school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling on the allegations against him "additional of the groundtetic and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who are angry that Helary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos said that she believed that Kavanaug's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he had shown that he had prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelos was welcomed when she was asked whether she tried to accuse Kavanaug if he was confirmed, and whether Democrats obtain a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, so he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court that is currently in it," said Pelos.
Kavanaug is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Plenipotentiary authorities have also concluded that, as a Democrat, it is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not appropriate that a person with ministerial prejudices goes to court and expects to say, "very good," said Pelios.
And women need to exercise their Authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she can't say what to say without crying.
"We will cry when we wake up," she said to me, "sinner Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "I've had a lot of woman who was tied in some other place, who said that even she would cry when she was upset, but developed a technique that meant that when she was shaking and crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm likely thinking she's being sad because she's crying.
I'm angry."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was a brilliant thing."
The crying is allowed as a way to partially express his great anger because they are basically interpreted incorrectly.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where once I found myself crying with disproportionate anger, was when an older woman took me from the middle of a flock - a white manager who always feared some of it - and carried me to the hospital.
"Never let them see those who cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy that they've been able to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going to issue for presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside the marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and released from the election, Ms Schroider, very upset, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-planned decision," she said with a breath 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who would come out for the election, and the last thing he wanted was another candidate.
Someone called her "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds, and therefore she resolved that she would not go out to the election if she did not make $2 million.
She was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to her men would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll take something according to?" she said she.
When she did her speech where she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported it, he was angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and angry with sex - that was spent.
"I probably thought I had these strong brakes," I reminded Ms. Schroeder about the way the media reacted to it.
"I thought Klyenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of bombs from the air of the opening of the US-China trade war would have left you alone, while the battle remains to end, a lack of agreement between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave a first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (Ø150 billion), and effectively tax all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing was renewed every time in the same manner, while more recently it was presenting charges of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second world economy will rise in the near future.
The fact that Washington makes a step back means that it accepts the requests, but publicly the fact that China has turned the US into too embarrassed for X Jinping, China president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade forces can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for starting economic hardship in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the inspectors recognised before," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia in the New American Security Centre, which is a reflection group.
Syria is a "pretended" that refugees return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.

"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now present for voluntary return of refugees in the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime welcomes assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the section.

According to the FWC, excessive alkali growth conditions in isolated areas are reported in the areas of Penellas, Manate, Sarsota, Charlotote and Collier – suggesting decreased concentrations.
The Red Tide, which is an excessive growth of alkat, extends around 130 miles of the coast from the top of Penellas to the countries under Lee.
The isolated areas can be found around 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but at less locations related to last week.
Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In addition, the Commission notes that the Commission's assessment of the measures was based on the fact that the measures were in place.
In order to reduce the risk of respiratory irritation, it should be reported in the Pinellas, Manate, Sarsota, Lee, and Collier contaminants.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
