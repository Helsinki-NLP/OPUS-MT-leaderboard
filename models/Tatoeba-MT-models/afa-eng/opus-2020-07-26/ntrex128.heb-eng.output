"Permant's friends in Wales are afraid to look like dolls."
Some of Parliament's members were afraid of the suggestion that the title of their role would change from the AMs to the MWPs.
Feared, it woke up following plans to change the name of the billing house to the Wilsh Parlia.
The members of the Parliament are concerned that the thing will be invited to celebrate.
One member of the Limbour party said his men were afraid that "it would get out with Twp and Pwp."
For a name outside of Wales: Boulshi, a stupid twp and a-pwp mean poop.
A member of the Parliament of the Party said that all his friends were "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Voltian Guard Party said that his friends were “open to suggestions” about changing the name, but noted that the name MWP (introductions of the member of Parliament Wally) sounds very similar to the word Muplet.
In this connection, the Voltian signal w is similar to the expression of the signal and in English in the Yukshir look.
"The final decision on all words as to the names of the members of the executors is, of course, the decision of the executors themselves."
The 2017 law of the Wiess government granted the executor's house authority to change his name.
In June, the Committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, where extensive support was given to changing the name of the executor to the "Welsh Parliament".
With regard to the title of the role of the members of the Parliament, the committee recommended the members of the Federal Parliament or the heads of the WMPs, but the MWP has received most support in consulting the public.
The members of the Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve Constanance may cause a little bit of a headache to the committee, Alan Guance, which is supposed to submit a taste for changes in the next few weeks.
The revision of other changes in the work of the expatriate, including the rules to remove members of Parliament and build the committee system.
The appointment of members of the Parliament is that they will eventually establish their title of office during the hearings.
Citizens from Macedonia go to the cards on the question with a change in the name of the country
The citizens will vote on Sunday on the question of whether to change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The people's wish is to try to solve a decades-old disagreement with the neighboring Greek, where a province called Macedonia exists.
Greek claimed for a long time that the name of her home from the north was in the fence that claimed to be the territory of Greece and returned and opposed the attempt by Macedonia to join the European Union and the United States.
President from Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about changing the name, said he'd ignore his findings.
However, anyone who supports the question of the people, including Prime Minister Zoran Ziev, claims that the change of name is just the price to pay to join the European Union and the United States.
The bells of St. Martin’s Church are bleeding in the harsh presence of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, "old neighborhood residents used to be a bar and a church in every corner."
"Since there are no bars and no churches."
What he's saying is, you can understand the disappearances of barons.
"People's society lives today are different," noted.
"Breams are no longer in the neighborhood where people visit on a regular basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that money from selling property will not last for so long as church leaders expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the beginning”.
Speaking of the church’s location, they will capture housing buildings with common homes that feed people who are not of the kind that helps them to maintain a unique character.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, ” he says, “so this will deny the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these homes will join these churches.”
Both churches were built by communities that believed in buildings, before Harlem became a neighbourhood of a large black population - the Communist missionary Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The White Democrat community left in the early 30s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owners of the building.
St. Martin's church moved by a black community of believers under priest John Howard Johnson, who led on the 125th Street traders, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or take up black.
It was burned in 1939, causing serious damage to the building, but as part of the programs of believers under priest Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the building of the bell.
Father David John Johnson, the son of Johnson Father and whoever inherited his place at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the “the bells of the poor”.
The expert who played at a July interview named him another name, "cultural treasure" and "his historical tool.
The expert, Tiny Ing from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the first bell alarm in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was next playing the greatest radiation at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marioth said St. Martin's church didn't suit him.
What has happened in St. Martin's church over the past few months has been a complex story of explorers and contractors, some of whom have been brought by local church leaders, and others by the apologists.
The meeting, which is the governing body of the community of believers composed of local believers, wrote in July for the beauty of a letter in which she published her concerns that the bishops were trying to roll the rise to the assembly, although the meeting was not involved in the discovery of the academics and the receptioners sent by the bishops.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of access to the bishops.
A 13-year-old shark wounding a 13-year-old in the shadow to catch the Lobsters
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday at the time that the boy was shot to catch Lobsters in California on the first day of the Lobster season, thus delivering official causes.
The attack occurred a little before 7:00 a.m. next to the Bay of Beacon in Ananitas.
Chad Hammer told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he called friends from this one hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then he went out there with a team to help him carry him to the beach.
The widow thought at first only an enthusiastic cry on Lobster's shoulder, but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I'm bitten!"
I was bitten!"
He said that when he came close to the boy, he saw that his whole bone of skin had gone out.
I yelled for everyone to get out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was beaten to the Rudi hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as a human being.
Not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
The rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a different shark existed in a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered tragic injuries in the upper body area.
The authorities closed up access to a beach between the Ponto Coast in Casabud and the Sumay Coast in Sinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to cross into a beauty market in Britain.
Sainsbury's starting a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opening up a passage in his dog store style with professional women.
As part of a significant initiative to enter the United Kingdom market of 2.8 billion Starlings a year, and as time continues to grow, sales in fashion and household products will be added to additional shops next year.
The investment in beautiful products comes at a time when operators will find other ways to use the pages that have been seized by televisions, mikes, and home products.
Sansbury's reported that the company was expected to double its beauty performance to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in her history.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will even get to another area with live brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The network also rescinds its makeup product line - Boutique - so that most of the products will be friendly to natural beings, which suggests that he's in need of a fight against young markets.
In addition, the Sansbury's two-stop store network, the first of which was opened in the Caribbean, south of London, last week, and the second will be opened in the Oak Bay, Bramingham, later this year.
On-line shopping and going beyond buying smaller food quantities every day at local comfortable stores that need to be done more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Koffa, chief of Sansbury's, said the branches would become more and more dog stores while the food network was trying to fight against Aldi and Ledl's single networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's added sales points of Argos in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat since she bought the two networks two years ago, added that she had sold food products and made the purchases more profitable.
Previously the network's attempts to revive the beauty product departments and its pharmacy houses ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint initiative with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the calls ended after a disagreement on how to divide the profits from the pharmacy houses into the restaurants.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the commercial activity of the pharmacy houses in 281 snouts for the Celsio, the owner of the Loyds Network for 125 million Sterlings three years ago.
According to the Lloyds, the plan was filled, by the spread of the brand-up of the Yurkas to the skin, including La Roche-Posay and the Vichy, in four stores.
The commercial manager of Sansbury's, Paul Mills-Heeks, said: "We have done a change in the appearance and sense of our beauty tradesmen, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we invested in those who were especially trained and were in a position to give advice.
Our set-up is intended to match every need, and our extended and comfortable environment makes us an attractive target for the acquisition of beautiful products, as we read about the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby cancels an 11 million-dolleng deal.
The TV program star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, showed a "whistle" after the "Holley and Willaby TV access canceled an 11 million-year deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marx And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, there's no time for Vilavi for a brand of their home and alien clothes.
The other two's joint business is like a Goop's goo-goop game of the Gwynth Faltero player.
The 37-year-old This Morenning program's access to the Post in Astgrum.
Holly Willaby left the Star of the Dragons Den Peter's mad at the recent cancellation of her participation in the two's expensive lifestyles -- to focus on her fat contracts with Marks And Spence and with ITV.
Sources reported that "Wans responded in anger" when the TV star announced during a Tuesday meeting in his business empire's chief offices in Marlo, Bachinga Guiser, following her new deals - in terms of up to 1.5 Terling - that she didn't have enough time to dedicate her house and their armies to celebrating their Truly.
The other two's joint business was thought to be like a Goop game of the Gwynth Faltero player and was expected to double the Wilabi's fortune, which we learned at 11 million shrilling.
While the 37-year-old Wilabi published in Instagrum that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his desperate homes.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her income in the next few decades.
A decision to leave completely affected all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to playing.
The social warehouses in Marlo are full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the attitude of Theis Morenning, one of the most popular stars in Britain, may be taken up by millions of companies as a result of massive investments in diverse products, selling cars and candles to household clothes, and possible further delay in shopping.
And it might bring an end to long friendships.
Wilabi, who was a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldovin were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, in ten years.
Wilabi set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and Vens 52 joined the company's director in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones is the owner of 40 percent of Baldowin's TV company.
Willaby will become the Ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Annette McFretlin as an access point in the I'm A Celebrity of ITV program.
A close source to Jones said last night: "We don't respond about his business."

He made fun of the review. He won the news press on the honesty of some of the leaders as "unPresidential" and he's so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so much and give up?
He said Trump in the voice of "New Delegate."
"I haven't done anything wrong."
He said that there was interest in a second meeting after he praised their first meeting in June as a major step towards North Korean nuclear weapons.
But the negotiations on the freaking out of nuclear weapons frozen.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea, Ri Young Ho, told the world leaders on Saturday at the U.S. General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "good response" from the United States to the initial nuclear efforts made by North Korea.
Instead, according to him, the U.S. continues with mechanisms designed to keep the pressure going.
Trump was taken at a much more optimistic point of view in his arrest speech.
"We're in a great situation with North Korea," he said.
We almost went to war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim brought positive results -- stopping missile tests, helping to release prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he protected his extraordinary approach to his speech about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be my president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump when he was voting right ahead of him.
A Nazi and a land community in Indonesia have caused the destruction of I and the killing of hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombuk, for example, strangers are told that they don't need their help.
Although more than 10% of Lumbuk's population lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they didn't ask for international assistance, so it's a little challenging," said Mrs. Sombong.
Although Save the Children is making a team that will be sent to Faloo, it is not yet clear if foreign messengers can move in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, a reporter of the National Hospital Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are doing an assessment of the situation in Pallo to check whether more international services are contributing to the relief effort.
In view of the undiscovered earthquake in Indonesia, the country is left to a tragic extent unsatisfied for natural disasters.
While Cencamey was built in the province of Achia, they're rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the lack of a clear warning warning of wildfire in Paleo, even though there is a warning, will result in loss of soul.
Even in the best of times, the trip between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship that runs in Lombuk to take care of the victims of an earthquake makes her way to Falo, but it will take at least three days to get to the new disaster zone.
The prosperity of Indonesia's evil exchange was set up at President Wakó Weidou's electoral tour center, and he invested many funds in the streets and railway tracks.
But Mr. G. Wuko has been faced with funding for his re-election next year.
Mr. G. Wuko was also under pressure from a continuing class test in Indonesia as a result of the religious dedication of the Muslim majority in the country.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes in the vicinity of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets -- using knives, bars, bars and other domestic weapons.
Daniel Street from the Liverpool Group is the last time in front of C.L.A.
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from the loss of Lessy in Permier League with a gate on Saturday Saturday at Stepford Bridge in London.
Strid' got a transfer from Odrian Shakary when he was about 30 feet from C'Lci's gate and his team at 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick into the far line.
The ball's flying high above the range and moving towards the top right corner of the network.
Eventually, the ball landed above the Kappa Archipelago gate that moved into it and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and players like Shack always play as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as long as possible, and told Sadridge to the LiverpoolFC.com website.
"I saw Kenta and I made one hit and I didn't think about it too much and just kicked."
Lessy was led to 0-1 in half after the Belgian planet Eden Zagreb was a lamb gate in the 25th minute.
The "Blue Blue" took a boat back to Mato Kobachitz in the same game, before he turned close to the middle of the field and ran fast into the half of Liverpool's field.
Kobatch's been doing an exercise and you'll be quick in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful out of the way, which led the alien into the vastness.
The old alien runs the defense and ends up with the ball inside the top right corner of the gate, with a kick that left passed the Liberol Alison bar.
Libpol will face Napoleon at the house of the Allies League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paulo Assembly in Nafoli, Italy.
C.L.C. will face videoton in the European FBI League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
From the murder in the Czech Republic in Indonesia rose to 832
From the land conference killing in Indonesia has been estimated to 832, so the State Disaster Agency was informed on Sunday morning.
It is reported that many people are trapped in the destruction of the buildings that collapsed at the 7.5 Earth, which took place on Friday and caused the waves to rise up to six feet [6 m] tall, said an agency reporter Sototopo Forw Neroho at a press conference.
The city of Pallo, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins from buildings that have collapsed.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was killed.
The police opened up a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Beccand, Marziside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John's Street when the body was shot, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call people out of the area who saw or heard something coming to her.
Inspector Brian O'Hungan says: "In the beginning, the investigation is in, but I would like to make a statement to anyone who was near John's Street in Birkenbad and who saw or heard anything suspicious, come to us.
I would also like to ask any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something in a car camera, to come to us -- since the photographs may include vital information for our investigation."
A police reporter confirmed that the dead woman was living in Birkend and that she was inside a building.
Some friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues while the police have announced that they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A cab driver living in Grason Mess tried this time to enter his apartment, but he was told that the police had ordered everyone to enter the building or get out of it.
He was shocked when she found out what happened.
The tenants are now told to spend more hours until they get back to their homes.
A cop sounds like the one person the whole area is now considered to be a crime scene.
A woman looked at the scene when she was crying.
She's coming back and saying "It's terrible."
At 2:00, there were two police trucks inside the scene and one more of them out there.
A number of cops were placed inside the scene when they set people up in the apartment building.
Anyone who holds information is required to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPolCC, to escort 101 or turn to the Crimestoppers on the phone and indicate the journal number 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's panel became the next target of attacks on memory situations in a struggle around history.
The statue will be a poaytical justice in light of the Italian syke, which will support the Puritans for so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But in the Cromwell League, Mr. Creek's offer is "foolish" and "tried to write history."
John Goldsem, director of the Cromwell Association, said: "I should have avoided the current disagreement on the closure of the statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell, who was placed outside the Westminster palace, would become a target.
The scourge of civil war in England was not done at Cromwell's command and not at his hand.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell fell victim because of the actions of one of his predecessors at Thomas Cromwell in the first century.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the statue Sir William Hamm-Tornicroft is a testimony to the 19th century and a part of the history of many who believe that they still deserve to share respect.
Mr. Goldsmi said to the Sandy Telegraph: "Cromowell was caught by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as those who protected Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the queen.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is a matter of ongoing history.
The fact that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century has further shaped our nation's development, and Cromwell is one distinct character representing one side of the corn in that time.
His achievements as a protected Lord are also worthy of honor and victory."
A deadly pig to drive a Chinese farmer to death
Local media sources report that a pig attacked agricultural death in the market in south-west China.
The man, named his family, was found dead with a varic when he was covered with blood next to the pig's shop in the Blopgenway market in Gwijuo County, so reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
An angel is preparing to inject vaccines to the pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Siningh County, China.
According to the reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin son from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that a door to an open pighouse was open.
He said that a big male pig was found with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighs 200 pounds (250 kg) attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were full of blood and leprosy," he told the cousin whose family was named "Wow", as he was shot at the Guiang Evening News.
A security camera camera showed Joan entered the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Joan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and smells to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police collect evidence in the scene.
It has been reported that a dispute between Joan’s family and the market authorities about the execution of his death was carried out.
Although the phenomenon is rare, it has already been reported that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused human casualties.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighs 300 pounds (300 kg) a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife took the animal away.
After the grower in Orton was bitten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer of my favor told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may be "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very researchist... They're not gonna hurt you.
We just have to give them the right degree of respect," he said.
The hurricane remnants of the hurricane Rosa will make heavy rains in vast areas south-west of the United States.
According to the front, the hurricane Rosa was weakened while moving over the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the storm Rosa will bring the sights all over North Mexico and South-West of the United States over the next few days.
The winds at the end of Rosa arrived at speeds of 135 miles per hour, i.e., the hurricane storm at step 1, and right for Sunday at 5:00 a.m., according to the east coast clock, the storm is 620 miles south-east to Ponte Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa's expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is starting to be created in the Pacific, which is heading east toward the eastern coast of the United States, with Rosa approaching the southern part of the island at California on the second day of a tropical storm, it will start to push into deep tropical tropical waters north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 miles of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical storm that will combine with the nearest economy will produce heavy rain clouds in large areas in the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will cause flashing and danger of land degradation in the desert.
A deep tropical storm will cause the rain clouds to reach 50 to 75 miles an hour at different points, especially in parts of the south of Navada and Arizona.
The peaks of 50 to 100 millimeters are expected in parts of the south-west of the United States, especially in Barcelona.
We'll be covered in a flash with conditions that are rapidly deteriorating due to the nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking to long distances in the desert when there is danger of tropical rain.
A heavy rain may make canyons into a raging river and a storm may bring powerful winds and dust storms.
The nearest economy will bring local rain to parts of the coast of South California.
We'll get a total of more than 13 millimeters, which could cause a waste of the road and parts.
It'll be the first rain in this rain season.
A tropical tropical rain mill will begin to get closer to Arsena on Sunday afternoon and on Monday morning, and the rain will be strengthened and spread by Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain would spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the United States, while the Arctic region cools but the tropical region remains quite warm.
This situation often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the U.S. Center.
There's a temperature of almost 10 degrees between the Canzzes City, Mauri and her mother, Nebraska and St. Louis Lada Moin, Iva.
In the next few days, an attractive summer fever will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October, the temperature will be warm in most central and eastern regions of the United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees south and east.
In New York temperature City can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecast shows high chances for high temperatures from average in the East of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Bert Quano's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday, on six television networks, in the bitter testimony of the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Quano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly caused by the previous 80s of the previous century, Christine Black.
In the meantime, the political debate continues, with news in the middle of the regular transmissions to announce a surprise development on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Marzana F. F. F.B.I. will conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Legal Committee of the Saints that she was safe at 100% that Qwano was wearing her body as drunk and tried to spread it during a high school-level party.
Quano, in a mixed witness, said he was safe at 100% that it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the report of 20.4 million observers by the Nessan manual.
Nilssen company checked the average view of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Chanel and MSNBC networks.
The data were not immediately available for other networks that generated the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and-Fox Business Network.
And Nellensan usually finds it hard to track down people watching the offices.
For the sake of comparison, it's about a crowd watching a similar scale of football or Oscar's play.
According to Nessen data, Fox News Channel, which provides excellent support in the season of Kawano, has led to an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing.
ABC is second positioned with 3.26 million observers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2.52 million, according to the Nexen report.
The interest level remains high after the hearing.
Senator Pleak was the main character of the drama that took place on Friday.
After a announcement that he would vote for the title of the Kwaanuuu, the Republican Senator's office was shown by CNN and CBS cameras when a group of hostages yelled at him while trying to enter the elevator to reach the hearing on the Legal Committee.
He's been in a low eye for a few minutes while the Mammals hit him, when all of this is made alive in the CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
He said that his office had announced a message and said, before the elevator door was closed, that he would say more things in the hearing at the committee.
All the transmission and delivery networks spent a few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to point to the entry into office of Quana to vote in the St.
But Pleak said he'd vote for the deadline only on the condition you'd get an understanding of the FBI's charges against the candidate for the next week, which my Democrats required.
Pleak is partly convinced by the fact that there are conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with a fine and a number of Senators later, Pleak made his decision.
Pleak's decision had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not be most likely to confirm Quano's term without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Quano.
Head of the government of Britain, Theresa May, accused a visitor that they're playing in politics on the subject of Braksite.

The police crashing down the little corals in approaching this year's vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after exhibiting independence support with police forces in the demonstration area, and thousands joined in protesting against the first anniversary of the anniversary of the protesting election on Catholic independence.
A group of sledge bells were sealed by the police in the show area, dropped on the cops in eggs and removed paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets, usually dead in the wells.
Conflicts broke out later that day when the cops had to use the plates to overcome the exhibits.
For a number of hours, self-supporting groups have been formed that sang “not forgotten, not forgiven” in front of the one-sided supporters who called themselves Spanish.
In the local press, it is reported that 14 people were treated with minor injuries suffered by the showers.
The suspensions remain high in the autonomous regions one year after the last of October 1st of the people being sentenced to a legal prison by the Spanish government, but celebrated by the independence-supporting Catalists.
The voters chose most of the large votes to become a independent country, although the percentage of the vote was low when those who refused to say good-bye to most of them won the vote.
The authorities of Catalonia reported that almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote from being carried out by cards throughout the region in violent conflicts.
Independent teams have set up a nightclub on Fridays to prevent the show of support in the national police.
The show was in existence but had to run a different course.
Therems, 68-year-old electrician who participated in the test with his wife, said he had lost hope of getting independence.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy about they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalogues won a significant victory, although at the last December election, they were determined to maintain Montaum this year when many of their most famous leaders, who stand on the sidelines or in prisons waiting for a trial of some of them in the organization of the people's question and following their declaration of independence.
Juan Poig, a 42-year-old journalist who recorded the police support display on his phone device, said the violence was caused by politicians on both sides of the earthquake.
"It's going out and out," he said.
On Saturday, Aureol Yonkers, one of the nine young leaders sitting in jail waiting for a trial since last year, that he'll be on the election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand up for European elections is the best way to invest her life in democratic values and the suffering we would have witnessed from the Spanish government, ” he says.
Lundendary: Some men were arrested after a car crashed into the house.
Three men -- 33, 34 and 39 years of age -- were arrested after a car crashed several times in London.
The event took place in Blingang Crent on Thursday, around 19:30, according to Britain's clock.
Detective Bob Bellings said that they had damage to the gates and yes to the building itself.
It may also be that at some point an arrow was shot in the direction of the car.
Manga's kick gives Lilongston victory 1-0 on Rang's.
Dolly's first gate of a liwingston promised the victory
Livingston, who just went up to League, surprised Rang's and coach Steven G'Rard that it's only his second loss in 18 games as the director of the Iberex Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved a level with Hibernian instead.
"Rar's group is left without victory out of the high-tension house, and you're dealing with the Harts model, which's back at eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rang's gonna host Rapid Vina in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Lewingston has been promoting the missing class at home for six games, and the lead coach has long seen a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak host.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before a gate was set up, when their access had caused Ring's problems.
Scott Robinson broke up ahead but dragged his tests before a gate, and then Alan Le Ligo could focus his efforts only on the distance after he slipped in to meet Craig Helgate's blow before the gate.
The guests were willing to allow Ring to play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the group to be invited to open up.
And that was the way the gate opened up.
Herring's a free kick and liwingston created an opening, Declan Gallager and Robinson joined to block the manga, hit a gate from the center of the globe.
At this point, Herrg's controlled the ball, but they found that house protection is uncontainable, and the gate of Liam Kelly is almost unattractive.
This pattern went to the second half, although Alfredo Morlos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was taken off by spies of the Rang's Ranz Allen MacGregor and the Gui's was touched by another free rhyme of Liigeston's problem.
Bullets continued to enter the Lewingston's range and destroy, while the two punishment pills -- after a fight on the replacement of Glenn Millton, and one on a hand-to-hand hit -- were removed.
♪ I'm going to have to go to the hospital ♪
Altaire Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony McCarone.
An amazing game and an amazing outcome from Livingstone.
All the players were great, and they continued to look forward to this wave up.
Their style of play and passion of players has almost not changed since they returned to the lead position, but they have to let a lot of credit rule over the way he's been drying the team since he arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holtett was awesome, leading to a well-organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and G and Wallel in high numbers all along the way.
The Herring House was not inspired.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under the Rar, they didn't stand these standards.
They had the final bullet missing -- only once they opened up the defense of the household team -- and that's a red Ring's shot, which they found themselves in the middle of the field.

Hundreds of opponents of Ardoyan - many of them rebels - also heard their voice, protesting that Ardoan's policy lines are on Germany's decision to welcome him in the country.
Desperate exhibits reflect the dispute around the guest that some Turks in Germany call it a hero and others protect it as a fan.

Hundreds of deaths in a land-based and ethnic-based community in Indonesia, and the number increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of whom have been swept by huge waves crashing on the coast, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Indonesi Solawi, thus reporting official sources on Saturday.
Many people gathered at the beach festival in Pallo on Friday, when waves carrying a height of 6 feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, and many were pushed to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake in the strength of 7.5.
When the Nazi threat woke up yesterday, people were still businessing on the beach and they were not running away, and they fell victim," Sotopo Forrow Norroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster management agency, in the Bata.
"He didn't come on his own, he dragged cars, wooden blocks, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Norho said, and he added that the guard had made progress on the open sea at 800 miles (497 miles an hour) before he hit the beach.
Some of the people picked on trees to escape from the cold and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people turned into 24 centres in Pallo.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Agency have shown a large number of homes and shops, towering bridges and bridges surrounded by water.
An earthquake continued to terrorize the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was moved in an area where 2.4 million inhabitants were living.
In Indonesia, the BPPT indicated that the energy released at the powerful assembly on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb spent on the rheumatic war in the second world war.
According to him, the geography of the city may be sitting at the end of a long, long, dry bay, the lady's size.
Noroho described the destruction as a "great" and said that my people had homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings that fell apart, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people missing.
Noruho said that the number of deaths and damage could be bigger along the north of Palo with a 300-mile beach line, an area called Dongella, which is closer to the land quake area.
The press is "completely happening and there's no information" from Dengella, Norho said.
In a region where over 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that his people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but things could get worse," he said.
On Saturday, she made a very serious review of the agency because she had not announced that a tsunami had hit his mouth, although official factors said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the video video that was broadcast in social networks, you can see a man on a high roof of a hysterical building shouting warning on the zancani approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying with him buildings and cars.
The Reuters Message Agency was not able to make sure that the film was authentic right away.
The panic and the cold have caused massive power stops that have shut down the media around Palo and demanded the authorities to adapt their rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send planes with assistance from Akarta and other caves, according to the authorities, but the survivors still need food and other essentials.
The city's airport has only been opened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President G. Wakou and his uncle planned to visit the rescue centers in Pallo on Sunday.
From the killing in the cold in Indonesia tipped over 800.
It's very difficult.
While the members of the World Vision Madangla came in peace to the city of Pallo, where they worked in a map of the bristles that had been set up in their office yards, they passed on a mirror of destruction on their way, saying Mr. Dusba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very difficult.
Even at the time that relief teams began to act as relief workers, we complained that you had been prevented from reaching out to many experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, people from other countries can be moved from funding, supplies and people only if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a district-level disaster," said Alicia Arian, a spokesperson of the Indian Red Cross.
"After the government says "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international assistance, but this position has been announced."
As the second night falls on Palo after the earthquake and the Nazis on Friday, friends and family members of the missing people will hope that their loved ones will be the ones who will be the ones who will bring back the grand stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was having a stupid shirt.
On Sunday, the rescuers were released a woman buried under the ashes for two days, with her mother's body on her side.
Ghandon Sovandono, the trainer of the Indonesia Emergency Directive team, trained two missing wind mills for Asia games, which ended earlier in Indonesia.
Others realize that those who are trapped in the hotel see, and among them Mr. Mandgie, were his students.
I'm carrying my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gondon recalled how in the hours after the news of the destruction of a hotel saw a spill in the air community, he sent the WhatsApp messages to the competitions in Polo, which took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one yellow review, instead of a pair of blue marks.
"I think the meaning is that the messages are not delivered," he said.

"I think the "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the meaning of the word is "you", and St said earlier this year, when he talked about the name of Albumo M with the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
♪ So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's moved from Kenya, which means the one and only, to just "Ye" -- just reflections of the good of our son, the bad we've built, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of the reflections of who we are."
He's one of the most famous rappers who've changed their name.

President Mexico has committed not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Loops Oberdor, committed never to use military power against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of blood transfusions against students.
Loops Oberdor promised on Saturday in the Telellco "Never Use the Army to Depress the Mexican People."
Army forces shot at the non-allied demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Loops Oberdor has committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who learn and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education force young people to crime.
The United States needs to double the funding of an artificial building.
With China's increased activity in the field of artificial understanding, the United States needs to double the amount it invests in research in the field, so says the researcher working in the field of artificial visual perception Kai-poi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and-Apple.
His words come after different parts of the U.S. government have made statements about artificial construction, even at an hour of the U.S. government has no strategy to build an official artificial structure.
In the meantime, China has introduced its plan last year: it's intended to be number 1 in an artificial building until 2030.
“The reduction of the research budget in the field of artificial understanding will be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next step in the field of artificial understanding”, he said.
The funding mix can double the chances that the next big angelic achievement will be achieved in the United States, told me to CNBC's network in the interview this week.
To me, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released in the light of the month in the Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt issue, which was adopted by the Royal Intelligence Venture Society in China.
In the early 80s of the previous century, he worked on an artificial construction system that designed the first-time colleger in the United States, and later served as senior director at the Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
I've been introduced to previous U.S. government technology interviews, such as the challenge of the European Research Agency's robotics, and the question of when you'll be next, to help identify the next vision people.
Investigators in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
"It's not China that you took us the leading investigators at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it," he told me.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have discovered from university stars in recent years to work in the field of artificial understanding.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts in the field of angelic understanding.
"I think you should automatically propose Green Card to the doctors in the field of angelic understanding," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council published its development plan for the next generation.
The National Institute for Natural Science provides funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Institute for Science and other government agencies from the U.S. Department of Constraints for Investigators, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, tell me.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department has set up a joint centre for an artificial building, which is intended for the evening for partners from industry and academics, and the White House has announced the establishment of a special committee for an artificial building.
And the month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative in the field of angelic understanding under the name AI Next.
And with regard to NSF, it now invests over $100 million a year in research in the field of angelic understanding.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Development Initiative designed to create a National Security Committee for an artificial construction has not been active for months.
The people of Macedonia vote on the question with the question whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia vote on the question whether to change her name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a ten-year-old mutually agreed solution with Greece that prevented her from joining the European Union and Lanette.
Greece, where a district called Macedonia exists, claims that the name of its northern neighborhood is in the Greek and Tibetan area of the Nat and the European Union.
Both countries signed in June on a deal based on the proposed new name, but they oppose the Germans saying that the change would damage the identity of the sovereign majority of Macedonia's population.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the people's question and the round trip question whether the voters would stand at a minimum of 50 percent so that the people's left would be attacked.
The question in the vote note is, "If you're in favour of joining Nat and the European Union with the Greek agreement."
Whoever supports the change of name, including the Prime Minister of Zoan Zibe, claims that it is a price worth it to pay to Macedonia, which is one of the countries created by Yugoslavia's bureaucracy, you can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all," said Olivera George Sevca, age 79.
Although the question of the people is not legally binding, enough of the members of the Parliament said they would vote to make it a ring.
To change the name will require a majority of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The State Electoral Committee said there were no exceptions at 13:00.
However, only 16 percent of the voters stood, compared to 34 percent in the last election to Parliament in 2016, of which 66 percent were entitled to vote.
"I'm here to vote for my kids, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Slovensky, votes in the capital.
On September 30, 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zibe, his wife, and his son Doshko complete their voting note in Stromiz, Macedonia, on the question of the people of Macedonia on the change in the country's name, which opened the door to join the NATO and the European Union.
At the front of the Parliament's house in Skoya, and 54-year-old Dalmir Courderkov made a small broom and panties in front of the crowds who set up the people's wish.
"We're for Natho and the European Union, but we want to join the head of Zakko, not through the servants' entry," said Kuordrov.
We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
The Prime Minister Zibe said that companies in NATO would bring the most needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be over 80 percent of our citizens supporting the European Union and the Nat," said Zabe after voting.
He said that a positive outcome would be our future security.
A survey published on the second day of McDonia's policy investigation showed that 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the question of the people -- less than the required participation.
Another question, held by Telma TV's primary TV network, found that 57 of the replies are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of you, 70 percent said they'd vote.
In order for the people to succeed, the percentage of voters should be at least 50% and one more.
The failure of the question will be the first meaningful loss of the pro-West government policy since she got the power in May last year.
"Sister City" player, "Agoross, tweeted through all of Britton's defense to invest a gate."
Agoro and Sterling Rass broke the protection of Britton in the victory 2-0 of Manser City on Saturday at the Sundays at a conference with Hahadad at the St., England.
It looks like Shagoro was wearing the gate in easy Kelly.
The Argentine pioneer got a boat in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Britton's defense players, before he broke into the open field.
At this point, Agoro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on the Brython border.
And then he kicked a boat left, and found Sterling.
The English pioneer used his first touch across the way to hand the ball back to Agoro, who kicked the right foot and beat the gate of Britton, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet on the right side of the network.
"Agroro suffers from leg pain," said the head manager of Manser City to the writers.
We agreed he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's a dry gate at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave 'the contents of the sky' the advantage that began in the fights at the top league.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro's got the ball deep in Britton's field during this.
He sent a great cross-border ball along the right side of Leroy Sana.
Sana turned the ball before he led Sterling to the far line.
The heavenly player pushed the ball into the network right before he rolled out of the field.
Master City will face fashions in front of the game of the champion's house on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rein-Kar stadium in Zanesia, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler in front of Hercules.
With the presence of the Presidentlesss from the Filijauf competition, there was no good reason to push another start.
But a sheriff who plays a lot of contests, hopes to win on Sunday in front of Colorado Rexis, but only if there's still any consequences on the Plyjauf for Hercosis, leading to one game on the L.A. Dog's Dog's League for NL West.
The rockes shot at at least an open ticket with a 5-2 win on the President's on Friday evening, but they still promised the first place at home.
Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the other group will play at the highest level probably at any point that I'll deal with this year.
Why don't I want to deal with it?"
The Presidents have yet to announce the start of the first day, but according to the reports, they tend to let the sheriff submit in such a situation.
Sherzer, it's going to be his 34th start, he's been trained on Thursday, and he's coming on his day of rest -- Sunday.
The right entry of Washington is with an ERA of 2.53 and - 300 in the 220 rounds of 2/3 season.

All we did was stand on the side of November.
Five more weeks for the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the fun, most--I'm not dealing, but actually I'm dealing and that's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on and said, "You see this horrible and horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power in any means you need, you see the evils, the evils.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to ruin to get power and control, that's what they want. It's power and control. We're not gonna give them this."
Democrats are, according to him, in the "Resistance and Interruption" mission.
“You see this over the last four days,” he said, and he said that the Democrats “are angry, evil, corrupt and not honest.”
He mentioned in her name the leader of the Messador at the Legal Committee of the St.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh, I waited until--it was really a bad body language-- the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Libour Party is no longer a Floristic place.
She's not patient with those who express their opinion.
When the Montomers at my local party office voted for me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of a line of members of Freemant from Libour who told them they didn't want to -- and only because we were sued.
My colleague in Freemant, Joan Ryan, won the same treatment because she stood up against anti-semitics.
In my case, the decision to introduce me visited me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
Concerning the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for the majority of Europeans, it is similar to those of the former party leaders.
At the Committee on the East Nottingham Liber Party Meeting on Friday, it was said, "We want the meeting to be a college and a fragility."
For most of my eight-year-olds as a local member of the Libert Party, meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were just like that.
Most importantly, it's not the hope of many of today's experiences and the promise of “more kind, more gentle” politics that has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It turns out more and more that the Liber Party has no tolerance for different views, and that every opinion is judged by being accepted as the party's leader.
This situation began shortly after 'Rami was elected to the top of the party, when former colleagues thought that we shared a similar political view, they began to expect him to make a rash and take steps that I would never have agreed to — whether on national security or on one European market.
Every time I talk in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying -- it immediately comes from an abuse of evidence of social networks with the hope of rejection, the political genome of the center and the health that I don't have to be at the Liber Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than I am, because the notes about me tending to be political.
I take advantage of the professional and sensibilities of the same colleagues who stand every day against the scourge of racial abuse but never get away.
One of the most disappointed aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become the subject of the challenge.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the LIBER party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we've been the same place as Floristic, and with every decision to "I.A.R." or a change of choice, the party becomes more likely.
Over the last two years, I'll be forced to shut up, not be so loud and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Lébour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been shocked by the suggestion of the government that my public school has almost broken down, looking for how to fight for better social services to those who need it most — whether as a member of a local council or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last few elections.
No man in the East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political positions and my conflicting conduct with the current one.
To those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country moves towards Brakesite that will harm our families, businesses and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of Leibur.
But in fact, the one message I have is not for the movement of Montom Pentengham, but for the public of my choice, whether they are members of the Limbour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of my rejection or political benefit will prompt me to act in the way I believe that you serve the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17
The last two quarters of the Tou's reduced the final result, but there is no doubt that Air is worthy of success in the great and wonderful game that is being held today in the Scotty High League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only inexplicable side of the decade.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking a lot of more risks, playing for the home group, and coach Peter Murch would have all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still inexplicable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of the Melros group said, "Lair is coming up with all the credit, they're taking better risks than we are."
Teri of Grant Anderson, quoted by Fraser Calmo, put Irre in the lead position, but a yellow card of the Sotland Rory Hughes team that was released to the game by Wuriors, allowed Melorus to get points and Jason Bagout's unwielded Tree.
Clemo raised the Air's delivery with a bet, before it was used in half, he was a lamb and then Mr. Trey Solo to get 17-5 to a half air.
But Marros opened the second half of Patrick Angerson, who was said by Gout, narrowed the gate to five points.
After that, a long delay was caused by a serious injury by Rhond Knut, which was taken away in Alonca, and began with the renewed game, Irère increased the gap through Stray of St. McDowell, which was said by Clemo.
So a yellow card, and once again, Marros took advantage of the other person with Trey who didn't say Bruce Colvin, at the end of a series of great pressure.
But the household team recovered, and when Strawan Tatchson got a yellow card on a bullet-free klimo attack, the punishment's place, Macperson was the lamb of Tach Down behind the Irre's progressive season.
Callo Meyer, just as he did again from the game, after Kyle Roy S.S. kicked David Armstrong's box and sent the Nary group to the sixth of the house team.
Styl Game Star seems ready for a new career in restaurants
The Styl Game Star, Ford Karinnan, seems ready to move to the restaurant branch after it was discovered that he was identified as a director of a licence restaurant company.
The 56-year-old player plays the role of KG Arvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and says he's holding up with his old partner for comedy, Greg.
The stage announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the plan, and that Kirnan seems to be planning life after Krylling.
According to the official records, he's the manager of Adriftmoon Limited.
The player refused to respond to the story, even though the source of the Scotish San Remez that Kiernan was looking for ways to enter the glazego's prosperous restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia that can't be found hoping that the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean.
Seaships at the command of the Navy are closed in a few boats in La Paz.
Public buildings are using a blue-coloured flag.
Seaship bases from Lake Titicaca and up to Amazons carry the password: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
In all parts of Bolivia that cannot be found at sea, the memory of a lost beach line in bloody conflicts over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as is the chemical to sail again into the Pacific.
These hopes may be in China for decades, at the time when Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the mumantoma, the spirit of unity and peace, and he of course looks forward to a positive attitude," said Roberto Claszilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will make a decision by the International Court of Human Rights on large-scale agreements throughout the country, hoping that the Bhag court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's request for decades after wrong conversations, Challa will be committed to a negotiations on the granting of universal access to the sea for Bolivia.
The Communist President of Bolivia, Uu Morales, who stood in the face of a conflict in a conflict to re-select next year, has made a lot of decisions on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But Persians believe that there's no chance that the court will be in favour of Bolivia -- and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't change much.
The U.S. court sitting in Hagg has no authority to grant Chela territory, indicating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the international court's conviction only came six weeks after the sound of the reasoned arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", but the "Paz Zarata", a Chinese expert for an international trial.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's claims, the last four years may have weakened them.
"The type of access to the sea has been seized by the current government in Bolivia," said Zarata.
Morale's war strategy has destroyed every remaining good will on the side of Ceila, to say.
Sometime Bolivia and Sheila will continue to talk, but it will be very hard to run discussions after that.
The two countries haven't changed between them since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez and Leather, a representative of Bolivia, rejected the idea that the court hearing was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be rewarded with a great opportunity to open a new era in the relationship with Chela and the chances of bringing an end to 139 years of differences for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Samuelles -- who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- is using the subject of the sea as a political model.
Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific, it has added.
"Course is a chance to see we have to get over the past."
North Korea says Pricke from nuclear damage will not happen unless she can give trust in the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Young, said I would never break the nuclear kiss first if she couldn't trust Washington.
Rie's on Saturday at the U.S. General Meeting.
He called on the U.S. to keep the promises made during the holiday in Singapore between the leaders of two other states.
His words come at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Popto, is on the threshold of a reopening of diplomatic nuclear-weapon contactes that came to a dead end more than three months after the holiday in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim J.g.
Ri said it's an Aspamia dream to think that the United States's continued sanctions and resistance to proclaim the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to bless.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea being taken first for significant nuclear-weapon-free acts.
They're Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, interested in the second grade.
There are, however, widespread doubts that North Korea is serious about how to direct its nuclear-weapon war zone, where it is likely to see the only way to protect security.
Pompo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new tard in huge hats found on the way to the expensive stores everywhere.
We'll find a solution for everyone who wants to expand the collection of hats or get a complete protection from the sun.
The designers, Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a line of huge and crazy headcovers for their SS19 complex at a fashion show that destroyed the style scene in the fashion week in Paris.
Unprecious hats that washed the summer Instagrum, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion presentation route.
Valentino's blubbered piece was a multi-coloured hat with a long-range cluttered side that covered the tops of the models.
Other amplifiers of a famous size have mixed promises, a magician hat, and even an anniversaries -- but they are not meant to protect their head from cold.
Tom Brown also exposed a pick of strange masks - check out during the Halloween celebration.
Many of the colors have two lips, and they have more lips and have more to wear to the ground than to be given to hot cotor.
One piece mentioned a shadow mask including Norclel and glasses, and another looked like a soft ice cream cap.
And whoever wants to go on with a huge fashion camera -- their time has come.
The fashion freaks are watching that the giant hills make their way to expensive stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after the bumba, the sledge hat with a half-metre-metre line that we're looking for on the head of everyone, starting with Emily Retaakowski.
Libel Callett behind the unprecise, imperceptibly hating social networks was another great piece of creation on the track -- the sea case was almost as large as the model of the sea garment that carried it.
The color sheet was burned, with gills of red and white leather, was the object in the SSS19 collection of the GKKK for reviraera in the fashion week in Paris.
"I'm watching big hats and big seabags arrive at the expensive stores next summer -- because the design made a huge impression and would be hard to ignore from the question of Luxsoriz size.
John Edward: Language skills are vital to the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a dance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is supported by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other works in the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), are setting up the best service level for students and parents.
Independent schools designed to prepare their students for further education and pride, for a career in which they will be selected and placed as citizens of the world.
As an educational curriculum that can be planned and implemented in a personal manner, we demonstrate that modern languages continue to be popular in a desirable field of study at school.
Nelson Mendella said: "When he speaks to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
Speaking to a man in his tongue, it goes into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last year's tests can be seen in languages with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a high A score.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received a higher degree of A in Mandarinism, as well as 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that self - education schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need for them in the future.
Today, the language field as a choice is considered to be the same level as STEM citizens (scientifics, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the school programmes of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that according to the reasons why employers had ordered Cody to fill available tasks, 17 percent would be used to defray language skills.
Thus, to a greater and more effective degree, language skills are essential for preparing students for future careers.
There is a need to speak languages for future job opportunities, and these skills are vital in the world of globalisation.
Whatever human career he chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant future advantage because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically in a competitive position.
According to a survey of YouGov that included over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level that provided for the existence of a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-counter number of speakers, 15 percent.
That's why it is important to invest in language teaching for children today.
Knowing many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different in what languages you learn.
Some of the schools will focus more on the classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are most thought-most thought- provoking for Britain in the future for the 20th century, as a modern, Japanese language.
No matter what part of the child's business, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the schools, with a team of teachers in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment of learning to prepare children and to hunt them with skills needed to succeed in any future.
There can be no denial today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, there's to be seen in modern languages as international media.
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, language, and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the time call.
John Edward is the head of the Scotty Council for Independent Schools.
Baron's expected to play for the first time in Medi Lickers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans waiting to see Bron James play for the first time in the L.A.L.L. L.I.
Coach Lickers, Luke Walton, announced that James was gonna play the pre-trial game in front of Denver Nants on Sunday in San Diego.
But then we'll set a few minutes to play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48", written on the Leakers' official website.
Lickers Mike Trudel published on Twitter which is likely to assume that James will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James's was asked about his plans for six earlier games of Leakers.
"At this point of my career I don't need pre-trial games to prepare," he said.
Trump's time of arrest in West Virginia, Yutiov channel
President Donald Trump is opening up at the crater of election for tonight in Wiling, the Virginia system.
It's the first of five planned difficulties of Trump this week, including stopovers in friendly places like Tansey and Misicipe.
While voting for a Supreme Court judge, Trump was eager to build support for the coming middle of the priesthood, since the Republicans were in danger of losing control in Congress after the November vote.
What time does Tramp's arrest exist in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it on the Internet?
Tramp's arrest at Wiling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00, according to the East Coast clock, on September 29, 2018.
You can watch the arrest of Trump in West Virginia on the Internet at a direct pace in Yutavi.
It is likely that Stramp would treat the hearings that were held this week for the Supreme Court of Burt Quano, and they turned into experts around the charges of inappropriate sexual conduct, and that is why the vote was denied in St.
But the main objective of a crisis washed is to help the Republicans who face choices from November to get a little momentum.
Thus, from President Trump's election level, he said that the goal of these five hardships next week is to encourage volunteers and support in the hour of the fires of the Republicans trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the island and in the House of the Selector, according to Reuters.
“The control in Congress is so critical to his agenda, until the President is ready to visit as many countries as he can with the entry for the fast election season”, he said to Rewitter about the Trump's election trip that he asked to stay in that state.
The arrest tonight, which is planned to be held at the Wesbnko stadium in Wiling, can bring back support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw a press cover from the Pitzburg press, to the West and Virginia Metro Nuz evaluation.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month of a visit to West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate to St. Virginia West, Patrick Morrisy, who's out there.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the President should come here to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Hayder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Roiter.
Ryder Cape 2018: U.S. team shows a right to struggle to keep hope for the only games on Sunday
After three single-sided years, the fourth games on Sunday afternoon are maybe exactly what Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's motion is a fully-founded sports idea, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like that.
So where do they think we're gonna find the mutant now?
They had a six-point advantage, and now he's four, so we can see that a little bit of montium, said Horn Spiety at the end of a day.
Europe's at Beron, of course, four points forward with 12 more in the game.
But, as Spie says, Americans feel that they have a little spirit in the hospitals, and they have much to encourage, and not the last one in which they're in the form of a suffocate and a 's Thomas' who played with each other all day and every one of them runs three points out of four.
Sappy was a deadly slow to green and he was a personal leader.
The joys got stronger as his round continued, when he's playing critical Pat to win the game four all-square and Thomas went down two after two.
His pat that wins the game 15on won a similar alarm, the kind that he thinks the American team still believes there's hope.
"You really need to dig deep and just dig about your own game," he said, "Spiffie."
That's all that these players have left to do.
18 bodies to keep signatures.
The only players with more cross-sectional points and Thomas over the last few days are Francisco Molinary and Tommy Fletwood, the leading story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange step, but the magic, of Europe, is four out of four and all of them win.
"Moliwood" was the only step that didn't hit the shop on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the beys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back at 9:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy appears to be moving to and from the crowd, is based on the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than militod or Molinary to sign the potential European victory with the sun hanging on Le Gold National.
They'd better both at times in different groups.
However, it's early to talk about European glory.
Booth and Tawson and Web Simpson ended up with Sargio Grassia, a four-ball hero this morning, when he stole with Alex Norn.
Isoye and two times the front nine took the Spanishs and the robbers to the hole that they didn't come out of.
However, Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look close to the four pills and fours because of inter-linear interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change rapidly.
Europe played better as a team so far and significantly for the last day, but a fourth scan showed that the U.S. team was filled with a part of the fight, mostly within the United States, and questioned it.
Europe leads 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder Cap
Europe is in a healthy hall near the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday, 10-6 in front of the United States.
The full presentation of Tommy Flettod Wernsco Molinneri led the change with two wins on the struggling Tiger Woods, and raised the gap so far in the Le Gold National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side player, who tried to protect the hill lost in Hazellin two years ago, ruled against the Americans who missed the four ball games this morning, and brought the series to 3-1.
The American players showed much more resistance to the fourth games, and two games won, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep holding on to the hat, the friends of the sea Forrick need eight points from the 12 single games.
Flitwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Melinary, who won "Mulwood" after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second step that won four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After they beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four ball games, they continued together in a wonderful harmony to defeat the weak Woods and the Americanron d'Echmboo TV with a more specific result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself over two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of espionage, but so far he lost 19 out of the 29 games of the four and four, and seven in the row.
Justin Rose, who died during this morning's four-ball games, returned to join Herich Stanson in the fourth game to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coca, who run first and third in the world.
However, not everything was easy for European players to play in the soft weather and the cold wind that sat in the south-west of Paris.
The winner of the ballet three times Jordan Spite, and St. Thomas placed the sword for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the victory 2 and 1 for John Mead and Ian Pulter in the four-ball games and later beat Felter and Rory McCallroy 4 and 3 in the four games, after they lost the first two bodies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup group back from a negative quarter of four points to the only games, though, as the holders of the hat, the people of Forrick just needed to keep holding the hat.
However, after being placed in second place for two days, it seems that an attack on Sunday is beyond their means.
North Korea says, "No way and in no way, it's not going to break off one-sided weapon without faith.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on Saturday in the United States that the sanctions continue to deepen her lack of confidence in the United States and that there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons in one way or another under these circumstances.
Ri Young was announced at the U.S. General Meeting that North Korea was "significantly committed to a significant good will" in the year that changed, such as the cessation of nuclear missile tests, the signing of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to develop further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, we don't see any corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"If we do not believe in the United States, we can't be sure about our national protection and under such conditions and we're not going to throw ourselves off in the same way as nuclear weapons."
While Sherry returned to North Korea's well-known complaints about the US's objection to the nuclear pyrexic approach, which according to North Korea has been rewarded in the course of its radical actions, his statement seems to be important because she did not reject the nuclear-peak, as it had done in North Korea in the past.
Ri was associated with a joint announcement issued by Kim J.A. and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the President of America and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed himself to action towards the "nuclear green of the Korean half" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea requested an official end to the Korean War, which broke out in 1950-1953, but the United States Hall said that North Korea had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also objected to reducing international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first nuclear research" and raises the pressure of the sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of the U.S., and even resists "declaration of the end of the war", said R.
"The perception that sanctions can cause us to bow down is a dream in the Aspamia of people who are raised about us.
But the problem is that the severe consequences undermine our lack of trust."
Ray didn't mention the plans for the second grade between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States stressed in his speech in U.S. earlier than a week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Mon Gea-no in the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear type was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear furnace of the Korean half wouldn't have come to this end from a dead end."
However, Rie's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, so he told the U.S. General Assembly that the U.S. land attack in North Korea's tablets is inevitable after the "Mr. The Evil President" Trump called Kim "rocket Man" found on the suicide mission.
This year in the United States, Trump, which last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, gave Kim credit for his courage in making a gun-fighting move, but he said there was still much more work to do and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea's nuclear explosion.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a set time frame for that, adding that "if it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for the steps it took.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, told the United States Security Council on Thursday that "the coordination of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with urgency and not stop until we get a full and promising nuclear green."
The Security Council has supported one here by imposing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block the funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Popto met with Ri on the board of the U.S. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to make the next holiday.
Pompo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not come well.
He left A Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, but hours later, North Korea founded him on the establishment of "Gangster's demands."
North Korea promised a meeting with the Moon to break down a missile site and a nuclear facility, if the United States would be taken up "Communication actions".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" he was interested in including security assurances that he had committed to the Trump in Singapore, and that changes in the direction of the normalization of the Washington relationship.
Students in Harvard are taking a course on how to rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches the participants how to sleep more, trying to fight in the vast majority culture of staying awake all night with the help of Capain.
A academic study found that students at one university often have no idea about all the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassiller, professor of sleeping science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham And Wimens Hospital, planned the course, which you considered is the first one in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a statement about the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
“ At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said, ‘ Why are they telling me this just now, in my last year of school? ’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he told the Telegraph newspaper.
The course, which went through the first time this year, explains to students the principles of good sleep habits that help to achieve academic and academic achievement, and thus improve their overall status.
Paul Breyre, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to open the course after she found out that students had suffered from a severe illness during the week.
The course lasts an hour, including a series of interactive missions.
In one part, a picture of a room in the dorms, where students press coffee dishes, curtains, sports clothes and books - to get explanations of the effects of Capain and light and how to perform athletic performances are affected by a lack of sleep, as well as on the importance of the sleep camp.
In other words, it is given to participants how a continuing shortage of sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourage participants to think about their daily migration.
We know it won't change the student's behavior between night and night.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of the choice of smoking, add Professor Zisler.
According to proud culture, nightless success still exists, adding that modern technology and pressures are increasing and increasing on students cause the lack of sleep problems to grow.
Care for an adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be the secret weapon of every student to struggle with stress, noise and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because a sleep imprisonment passes the brain to hunger, so that we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old California student who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zisler design the course after he attended one of his first class in Harvard.
He said that the Cors saw his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask all students for advance descriptions to complete a similar order plan before joining the competition institution.
Professor Zisil advised students to check the possibility of a clock that will be used when it comes to going to sleep, not just for an hour when it is time to wake up, and to be awake to the effects of a blue light that has an electron approval and LED light, which can improve the rate of lightning and thus cause problems to rise.
"Lewingstone 1 - 0 Ring"s: "The gate of a manga" gives a signal to Gard's game.
Herrg's got another attack of losing in the game except when Dolly Manga got Stephen Richard's rebel players to win 1-0 in the Blingstone.
The Averyx players have been hoping to win their first win out of the game since the victory of 1-4 in February in St.
Minga attacked seven minutes before the half, and it didn't seem that Harng 's players would be equal.
While Hermes is now heading to sixth place, Lewingstone's climbing to third place and right after Hibrenian at the gate.
And maybe waiting for another 'recesses Debel to wait after the Coon Calum Spence needed to be treated for a head injury after the object was probably dropped from the offer.
"Gard's estimated eight exchanges in a group that replaced Air to the half of the end in the taffree cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with the 11 other luringstone players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could have been satisfied by the way his players confused the opponents in any situation.
Herring may have controlled the ball, but Lewingstone did more with the ball they had.
They almost washed in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman's house in the gate of Alan McGregor, but the middle player kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep-rooted kick of Kigan Jacob found Captain Craig Alk, but his shield Alan La Gui could only kick out of the grave.
Herrg's been taken over, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their last third game.
Alfredo Morlos certainly thought he should have decided for his own good after a quarter of an hour of play, when he and Steven Lewis were hit, but Judge Steven T.
Herrg's only managed to kick twice into the gate in the first half of the year, but the Averyx Lamam Kelly gate easily hit Sana Kolabali and Obi Ajaria's weak kick.
While Livingstone's opening in the 34th century was a figure of the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they were worth at least their hard work.
Herrg's again failed to deal with Jakovs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield didn't respond at the time Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a windline moving Manga to a simple finish.
“Gard did a half-life act when he replaced Colby with Ryan Kent, and the exchange brought about an immediate effect almost when the cripples/pecker pulled a bullet to Morlos, but Kelly ran off his line to block it.
But Lewingston continued to force the guest group to play just the kind of game he liked, when Le Lily and Helicit continued to send long pills.
Holt's team could have increased the delivery at the other stages, but MacGregor was well-established to prevent the attempt of J. Jacobs before the attack went off the corner.
The Rang's replacement player, Medelton, was in the process yet another claim to betray Jacobs, but Thompson ignored again.
Your address: Founder of Mona Giger
And now stand by "Sunday Morening": 30 September, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when the future psychologist Johns and William "The Hans" was born in Germany.
Gayer developed a method that allows for identification and radioactive testing, which eventually led to a device known as Mona Giger.
Since the device turned into science, but in 1950 it also became a mixture of pop culture, thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," where Roi Roger and Dale Evans were shut down as two strange mornings/scientific scientists:
Man, "What the hell is this thing?"
This is Mona Giger, which is used for the production of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you stick the ears, you can really hear the effects of radioactive effects on the atomics in minerals."
"Oh, my God, it's really bombed now!"
The Hans Jagger went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carried his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and destroy them.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes recovery of the patient's immune cells, and changes in the cells in the lab.
After that, cells can see a protein that shares many types of cancer and then they're freaking back into the patient.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of the patient's immune cells, the transformation of the cells in the lab so that they can see a protein called HER2 that is associated with many cancers, and then you threw the cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Brasoffsky, from the U.S. cancer institution in Botsda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stirring the development of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, breast cancer, vision, and bone marrow, was likely Professor Brasopsky.
A similar approach to taking patients' immune cells and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells managed to treat a type of cancer.
Kenya West broke into a speech supporting Trump, as a MAGA hat, after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't get in a good eye.
Kenya West responded at the health of Bouses in the studio during a dismal show in the Stardy Night program, while he was interviewing the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, and saying he ran to the president in 2020.
After he performed his third song on the program, called "Gosst Town" in the past in the Make America Great hat, he was wounded by a speech of proof against the Democrats and returned to his support at the Trump.
"So many times I'm talking to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd leave America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL chapter began with a performance in the direction of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star for the witness of Bert Quano to the Senate's Legal Committee, charged with a sexual assault by Christine Black.
Although the speech of proof is not part of the program, the thing was brought up to social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll West on the thing.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had made a review of the shots on the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out to the stage with this hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examine.
Weste kept saying, "Do you want to see the dark place?" saying he's wearing my superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were heard at least twice on the audience, and the SNL team seemed to be upset, the Varty report, and one of them said to the newspaper, "Thematic silence fell all over the studio."
West has been on a program as a last-minute replacement instead of the Aryana Granda, who was a former couple, Mac Miller, died a few days before.
Many hundred West when he did the song I gave it when he was wearing a Perier bottle.
West won a backup by the president of the TTPUSA, Kends Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most brave souls: Thank you for not surrendering."
But the E.R. Carne Hunter's approach wrote on Twitter West just "Be who he is and it's completely wonderful."
But I have chosen not to repay (by acquiring his music or his friendship or supporting his "art") that I think of an effort and the dissemination of an Ideology that can harm my community.
He's free.
And so are we." She added.
Before the plan, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and he said that now he's "the people that were known in the past as shopping West."
He's not the first artist who changes his name and goes after Didy's, also known as Pafe Dedy, Papi and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snope Doc, held the name of Snoop Leon, and, of course, the well-known musician Princes changed his name to the symbol and then to an artist who was formerly known as Pryce.
In an attempt to kill a victim at a restaurant in Bluffett
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Bluffet on Friday.
According to the police, the incident was in vain.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Bluffet court on Monday.
The charges will be checked by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of the show game of the throne, Keith Harrington, attack the men of the poison.
Kitt Reynton is known for the role of J.N. S.N.S. S.R.R.R.R.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.
But the 31-year-old player attacked the so-called hero's stratip, saying that such functions on the screen often convey the message to young children that they must be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he thought that 'something went wrong' and wondered how to deal with the problem of disgusting men in the Meto age.
Keith, who recently married another star in the game, Rose Lesley, who is also 31, admitted he's very upset about this type of treatment.
"Man, I'm feeling really upset right now -- where were we wrong on the way about masculinity?" He said.
"What do we teach men during their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing to?"
Keith believes that TV may be partially responsible for raising her in bitter masculinity, because of her very high figures.
He continued: “What do we learn from the outside?
What do we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young children feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how do you change it?
'Cause there's no doubt that something went wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series of follow-up games or a series of caste games after the end of the next summer, saying that he was "completed with the fields of war and horses."
Starting in November, Keith's version will be held in a month's version of Sam Shepherd's real West, which tells the story of a movie producer and his lost brother.
The player recently found out that he saw that he met his wife Rose as the best thing that had happened as a result of the rule.
"I knew my wife fine, so that this series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose found out the role of Yigrit, the love issue of John Snow, the fantasy class is winning the Emmy Prize.
The two of us got married in June 2018 at the Zasley family yard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% wage in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick, so they've become officially healthy.
About 40,000 new cases reported in the second half of 2018 only.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of a sexual history, which is a change to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased slightly, according to official health factors in China in the Yunnan district.
However, for a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000.
HIV infections as a result of a sexual occurrence are a problem burning in the U.S. community in China.
Homosexualism was prevented from being a citizen of the law in China in 1997, but it is said that the invasion against U.S. people is widespread.
Because of the State's conservative values, researchers estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the disease’s infections are the result of a lack of adequate protective measures in these species.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Wetters denies that a man from her team leaks information about Republican Senators and protects "Drug Lies" and "Conspiracy Theories"
The American Senator Maxine Waterers rejected the charges that a member of her team had published personal information about three American Senators on the Vikipedia pages of the Senators.
Democrat from Los Angeles estimated that claims are made by Internet sites and visits to “expressive Yemeni”.
"falses, lies and other lies are hateful," said Waters on Twitter.
According to the reports, the information published includes the address of the residents and the number of American Senators Lindsey Garham from south Carolina, and Mike and Orin Hattz, both of them Motota.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate on charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court judge, Bert Quano.
The leak took place some time after the three Senators asked Quano.
It was reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to the Waters' office and published the information on a member of the Waters Team, according to Hil's report.
"This baseless charge is completely wrong and completely false," added Waters.
My team member -- who is his personal identity and privacy were exposed, and our security was affected as a result of these false accusations and accusations -- was not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless guilt is completely wrong and absolutely false."
Wetters' announcement that she was quick to review the Internet, including from the former press secretary of the White House Harry Flycher.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fletcher.
“ The thing is that she doesn’t have the kind that she needs from Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't respond in anger.
He can't react to the earthquake.
He can't question the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and calm."
Fletcher seemed to have compared Walters' reaction to the review of the Democrats on Judge Quano, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Nouro, a Republican candidate who was trying to defeat Walters in the middle of the priesthood, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's big if it's the truth," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waterers said that the Office had turned to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agents on these false claims.
"We'll make sure the Hebrews will be discovered" is that they will continue, and that they will be brought to justice for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my team members."
A review of the film. Johnny Englesch 3.0.
It's now accepted to look for meaning in every new film about Barksite with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate to this resurrection of the actuary-codemia sect that started somewhere in 2003 with Johnny Inglich and woke up to live in 2011 with Johnny Inglelitch back.
Is it ironic self-esteem on how we're not worth anything to make our country's new production opportunity?
In any case, John Ingleshale, who has the eyes and the body face, has another chance of spoiling things -- and his name is more than any of the most extensive social creations designed for film viewers in non-English countries.
He's, of course, the stupid English agent, whose weird face of the Smurfing Smurf looks a little like a clauzo, a little Mr. Between and a lot of this guy who's been singled out for the fireships in the 2012 opening text of the Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger Gelem Atkinson in the forgotten TV ads for the Barclaycard, Smaire as a posterior.
There's one minute or two nice in the last edition of Johnny Inglech.
I liked the thing where Johnny Inglech was approaching the helicopter when he was wearing a middle-story belt, and the pushers were calling for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his cometic physical abilities, but humor feels too weak and increasingly strange, especially because the type of "speech" of dance movies like 007 and an impossible task itself now includes a cometic component.
The humor feels like it turns out to children instead of adults, and in my years of crazy inventions of Johnny Englesch are less brilliant and more focused on the jokes of Atkinson's perfect movie style in the form of Mr. Bin.
The film board starts when a major danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker to the super secret Internet of the British spy, and exposed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the concern of the Chief Agent - a small part of most regrettably to Kevin Aldon.
It's the last straw for the head of a government in a violent and violent form that has already suffered from the total collapse of political loss: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fulfill the role of Theresa May, but she doesn't have much to do with working on the script.
Her intelligence agencies inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she's gonna have to bring someone back from shocks.
And that means John Inglech Harbrian himself, who is now employed as a school manager in an expensive institution, but gives informal lessons as to how to be a secret spy: some of the good jokes here, when Inglelish offers an academic to the school style in the rock style.
Inglich is coming back to Victoria to an emergency and united briefing with his ex-assisted assistant to Buff, which acts again.
Buff is now a man married to a circuit commission, in the role of an angry class kingdom on which Vico Fredin is a little wasted.
So at the sign and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service admission to a terrible complex returns to action, when Pam-Pattal's model of Opalia Blutuba is used to embodies the Ulga Corlenco.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the magic of billionaires, a argue that he is able to solve Britain's computer problems - Jason Waltta, a mean man of Mike Lacey's age.
Inglich and Buff begin with their idealism that is more than a pair of clowns: in the guise of waiters, they set up a French restaurant fire; they create Andrelmosia when they smell their own famous jutta; and an enthusiast of the complete energy of his attempt to use a similar realistic kit to learn the inner structure of Walta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the last series, but in spite of affection and kindness, it has a sense of child TV.
A pretty medium level.
And like the other June Inglech movies, I couldn't think: could the British film industry not give Ryan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Liber Party denies that it's making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's resurrection party is considering a natural show that the British will work four days a week -- but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate managers to transfer the savings as a result of the AI revolution to workers in another form of rest day.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would fit the company's economic agenda and plans to turn the country off for the benefit of the employees.
Congress of Professionals supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way in which employees can enjoy changes in the economy.
A senior source at the Limer Party said to Sandy Times: “A policy examination is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen between night and night, but this four-day working week is where it fits the party's access to the re-scheduling of the economy for the benefit of the employees, and also the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Libour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day working week during its general election trip in 2017.
However, the ambition is not now supported by the Liber Party as a whole.
"A four-day job week is not a policy of the party and the party doesn't consider it."
The Libour Minister of the Treasure, John McDonal, used the party's conference last week to put his vision into a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonal said that he was determined to lose his power from "unfaced directors" and "costers" in service companies.
The scheme of the Authority for the Minister of Commerce also requires that existing clients in water companies not get back to their jobs because the government of Libour may do the least on the basis of a poor conduct.
It is also because there are programs to collect employees to the Boards of Directors of Company and create college-owned auctions to transfer 10 percent of the company's money in the private sector to employees, which will be entered into a two-year DVD for up to 500 years.
Lindsey Garham, John Candy told the TV show "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation about our quantum changed their mind
The FBI investigation held the charges against Judge Bert Quano holding the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week and raises the question whether the investigation findings could convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
In the opinion that on Sunday on the program 60 minutes, Scott Fly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Garham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
It looks like Kennedy was more open than his fellow to the South Carolina party.
"All said, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Quano.
I called him after it happened, the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, single-minded."
On the other hand, Graham's vote appeared to be on the rock.
"I've decided about Bert Quano and he's gonna need an exploding accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Burt denied it in an attack," added Graham, in relation to Christine Black.
And no one she mentioned could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how something can change."
What's a World's Civil Festival and did it contribute anything to reducing poverty?
Saturday New York described World's Civil Festival, a annual music event with the most impressive list of stars to appear and a less impressive goal of ending the world's poverty.
The World's Civil Festival, which exists this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who have run to a large island in Central Park not only to enjoy such events as the G.C.A., Cardi B. and Sean Mandes, but also to raise the announcements for the real purpose of the event - to put an end to extreme issues by 2030.
World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting in it.
To get a free card for an event (except if they are willing to pay for the VIP card), on the island of the concert to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" as a volunteer, to send an e-mail to a world leader, to call or other significant ways to help increase the announcements to the cause of an end to the poor.
But how successful was the festival really, when only 12 years before it was to fulfill its purpose?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to people really a way to convince them to require a call for action, or is it another case of "Calticibism" - people who really feel like they're affecting their signature on the Internet or send a flash on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World's Citizens' Organization has said that more than 19 million "operations" are supported, pushing for a variety of purposes.
According to these actions, Darwin has helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already started to be distributed or raised funds.
The group estimates that the set-up funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partners of investors and people who are committed to “help children to grow up in their potential”, and promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to nutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 weddings from the World's Citizens.
With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and ‘other citizens of the world’, we can make social justice a subject of undernourishment in history’, said The Power of Tourism ulman to the crowd during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been carried out in Britain to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government had announced the pace of the project, the Power of Education, reaching 5 million women and children with dietary interference.
In response to one of their online questions you ask "What makes you think we can end up extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world have said: "It'll be a long, difficult path -- sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the big movements of civil rights and opposition to Afrtade, we will succeed, because we're stronger together.
G.C.A., The Weeknd, Sean Mandez, Cardi B.J. Mune are among some of the events that took place at the New York Year's event.
The United States can use the marine force for the "sea shutdown" to delay the Russian energy output -- the Face Minister.
"When necessary", Washington could use the marine force to prevent the arrival of Russian energy to markets, including in the Middle East, discovered the U.S. Minister of the Ryan Zink Face, as was observed in Washington Exminer.
Zhenk claimed that the Russian industry in Syria, which you have done, is important to recall, at the invitation of the legal government, that it will run to spread new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to enter energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's Southern Heart," he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure the seamen are open and when a siege is needed to ensure that their energy sources are not coming to market," he said.
Zanci responded to events at the time of the release of Consumer Energy Alliance, a profit-free group that set itself up as "a collection of energy producers" in the United States.
He continued to speak and to compare Washington's expectations with that of Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are indeed identity.
The economic possibility of Iran and Russia is, less or less, a wave and a replacement of fuel types, he said, in relation to Russia as a "one trick's corner" because its economy depends on a stone bucket.
These statements come as the government of Trump goes out to increase its natural gas production to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are much cheaper for European producers.
For this reason, the government officials of Trump, and in all the U.S. President, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "Unmerited" drawing project, Nord Stars 2, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "Secretion".
Moscow has often felt that the planner line project, which accounts for $11 billion and that I'm supposed to double the current power capacity to 110 billion mC, is only an economic project.
Hermlin claims that Washington's intense opposition to the project is denied but only for economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an energy tool and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Secretary of Energy Affairs, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position has won an anti-war response from Germany, which reconfirms its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading German Industrial Institute, called on the United States to stay away from the energy policy of the European Union and from the two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Caspian and the Russian president and Dalmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, "Look seriously" said the President in 2020.
The Senator from St. Elizabeth Warren said on the Saturday that she was "considering seriously" the possibility of running the presidents after the election of the middle of the canon.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for presidents during a meeting in Holique City in Sates.
“The time has come for women to come to Washington to correct our broken government, and that's why a woman needs to stand in the head”, she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
After November 6th, I'll seriously consider the race for presidents.
Warren made her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said he was "leading the country to the wrong direction.
I'm worried about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren visited Trump at the time of Burt Quano's appointment as judge in the Supreme Court.
In a statement published on day and day, Warren said "of course we need the FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on the day of 'em showed that Warren's own choice of themselves does not seem to have to run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" voters in the 'Sustes' show that the Senator does not have to run for election, according to a survey of the Institute for Political Research of the University of Spock and the newspaper "Boston Global".
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of dealing with the Senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was much more support for the former Governor Duval Patrick, with 38% supporting his ability to run against 48% of those who opposed her.
Images from the Democratic Party that oiled in connection with possible responses to the 2020 election include former Vice-President W Biden and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Bedan said he'd make an official decision in January, according to the I.P.'s report.
Sarah Fillin points out the post-atomic stress disorder of Tark Fileen in the custody of Donald Trump.
26-year-old Trek Fileen lived in Iraq for a year after his joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with the incident of family violence on a day at 10:00 p.m.
"What's up with my son, what's going on since he came back, allows me to identify with families who have experienced the consequences of the PSD disorder and some of the injuries that our troops are returning," she told the group who participated in the arrest for Donald Trump in Tolasla, Oklahoma.
Fillen called his arrest “the fall in the room” and said about her son and other loose soldiers, “they return a bit of different, they come back dead, they wonder if what they gave their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the rest of the military, will be honored.”
He was arrested on the day of 'Visila, in Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, and he reported the case of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon under hire, according to Dan Bent, a West Police reporter.
18 states and the province of Colombia support the reading of the challenge on the new state asylum policy
Eight countries and the state of Colombia support a legal challenge reading on the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter for fugitive victims from situations where they are involved in gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the province have filled out a statement of the type of court friend on a day and in Washington to support the challenge reading on the asylum seekers' policies, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant in the "Griss v. Sashence" case, which the American Union filed civil rights in August, was not exposed.
She said that a couple of his violent associates, members of the gang, had abused her, but official factors in the government of the United States rejected her request for shelter on July 20, 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's State Secretarys described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a large number of requests for a state shelter in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems with all that concerns gangs and family violence.
The U.S. State Security Policy cancelled a decision from 2014 of the BIA Council on immigration frauds that allows non-certificate immigrants to escape from the situations of domestic violence, to file a request for a state shelter.
The Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Resin, said in a statement on the day that the new state “is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws”.
“Federal law requires all the debate on the requests of the state attorney to rely on the facts and special circumstances of the request, and the ban on the establishment of the new policy violates this principle,” stated in a statement of the court ' s friend.
The lawyers also argued that the media, which hinders the entry of immigrants, affects the United States economy, because they tend to become the days and "require work", they say.
Attorney General F. Sshsens ordered immigration groups not to provide any more national shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“The national shelter is open to those who support their home country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, political, social, political, or political oppression,” said Sshsens in a policy announcement delivered on June 11.
The goal of the state shelter would never have been to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- where people stand every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Falto, while the death scenes are multiplied, in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more difficult than just a moment.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Rosa Kosma, 35 years old, and if the baby's squeezing at the center of Polo's destroyed city.
At every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The residents appear to return to their ruined homes, and they cross the surface of water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, from the 7.5 Earth conference, were surrounded.
Some of the wounded, including Dway Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder crises, had been left outside the Pallo military hospital, where they received treatment for severe shocks that continued after the earthquake.
The tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt about the violent earthquake in the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I've been pushed into the wall ruins, I think," said Harris to the FBI, and added that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was bleeding.
I don't know what happened to her and my girl.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for the "British" with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese press published a four-page report in American music, an aggressive promotion of the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Big King of using American newspapers to promote propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was charged with paying the Chinese newspaper 'Yina Dili' on December 6, when she claimed that China was the most familiar newspaper in the state of Iva -- after accusing China of participating in the election of the American Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that China has tried to interfere with the U.S. election has marked a new stage, according to official sources in the United States, on the settlement trip run by Washington with the aim of exerting pressure on China.
Although natural governments of foreign governments will be aware of the promotion of trade, Big Wing Washington is now stuck in the Guaa War, where each country is higher and compares the tax rates on the products coming from her country.
The tax industry, which has been rewarded by China at the early stage of the War of Trade, was intended to hurt the Muslims from countries like Iva, who supported the Trav Party, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Branstad, former governor of the United States of China for many years, and an important driver of agricultural goods to China, said Big King hit the workers, farmers and businesses of the Americas.
China, he wrote in an article on the day on which he wrote: "Encourage the actions of the allies by publicizing awareness in our free press."
The Chinese government uses America's precious freedom of speech and press, and publishes an awareness of the payment of the Moin Reg Eister, wrote Branstad.
“Responsively, at the Big Sing Street newspaper stand, you'll find voices of opposition pending and not see any real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the economic path of concern, considering that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of China's well-defined newspapers has avoided the proposal to publish, even though it has not been mentioned in a newspaper.
The Republican Party has cast out women's voices before the middle of the canon with the Quano incident, warning analists.
While several of the leaders of the Republican Party are on the side of the Supreme Court of Burt Quano and are protecting him for the presence of a number of charges of sexual assault, analist warned that they would see a reaction against, especially from women, during the next middle of the canon.
The feelings surrounding the matter were especially alive, and most Republicans officially express their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“This kind of thing can't be returned to the back," said Grant Riher, a state science student at the Maxwell University of the Ceracus University of The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Riher said he doubted that the last moment of Senator G. F. Pleak (of the Republican Party of Barcelona) would open an FBI investigation, enough for Physco to vote angry.
Women are not about to forget what happened yesterday -- they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said the day and 'Karin Z'n-Pierre, the National Council of Moveon, according to the newspaper, "Washington D.C.
When we showed in the Senate, the Republicans in the Senate chose to continue the promotion of Quano's term of office, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to a report of the Mic site.
"Democratism and democracy levels will establish new dates", he said to the news site of Stu Rotenberg, a non-participated political anlist.
People say they've been high; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the voices of women in Peru, and among young voters, between ages 18 and 29, who, because of their lack of affection for the President, are often prevented from voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, who published her accusations of sexual assault by the high court prosecutor, the leftrs claimed that you would respond against if the Republicans would continue to advance the appointment permit.
"The moment has caused the Republicans to become seriously involved," said Michael Steele, former National Commission of the Republic, at the beginning of last week's NBC news channel report.
“This is not only the voting of the committee or the final vote, or if Quano accepts the appointment, but also the way the Republicans handled it and the way they acted towards it,” noted the news channel G. Cecil, director of the U.S.
However, it seems that the Americans disagree in a little bit about the extent of their faith expressed in the testimony of Ford and Quano, with slightly higher support than in Ford.
A recent survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the replies certainly believed in or probably for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they certainly believed or probably Kono.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Qwano was certainly a liar or probably during his witness, while only 30 percent said it about Ford.
After the pressure on the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford and the charges filed by at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the gridian newspaper reports.
Ford testified in the week before the Senate's legal committee last week that Qwano attacked her as a drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court was exposed to her during a party where they attended their school at Yale University in the '80s.
A global global network founder is planning to start a new network to bury Google and Facebook.
Tim Brenners-Li, inventor of the World's Global Network of Start-Ps for the purpose of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that will open up Solid, the Brenners-Le Open Code.
Solid platform allows the user to choose where their data are stored and who are required to access different data types.
In an interview without the West Company, Berners-Lay laughed that meaning behind Inrupt is "world control".
"We have to do it now," he said about the Stratef.
This is a historical moment.
The app is using Solid's technology to allow people to create a personal online database or a POD.
The challenge could include a list of contact persons, lists of actions to perform, schedule, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Dryev, Michrosoph of Autaluk, Salak and Sputupei will be available all in one form, at the same time.
What connects the personal database is that the user only decides who can access information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company's calling it "own independence through data".
According to John Bruce, the director of the company, the intention is that - Inrupt will find the resources, the appropriate process and capabilities to assist everyone in the Solid attack.
Today, the company includes Breners-Li, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team with several keys hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programming.
Starting this week, technology keys from around the world can create cheap apps by means of tools available on the Inrupt website.
Breners-Le said he and his team didn't argue with Facebook and Google about their agreement or their refusal to bring about a complete change, which would lead to a complete turn-up and a night-by-night in all their business files.
We're not asking permission from them.
In a post published in the Media on Saturday, Bernards-Le wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in the Solid.
In 1994, Breners-Lay changed the Internet when he set up the network's programme organization, W3C at the 'Sustes' Technical Institute.
In the last few months, Bernards-ly had a voice that had an impact on net neutrality.
Even during the Inrupt's service, Breners-Le will continue to serve as a minister and head of the W3C organization, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm especially optimistic about the next age of the network," added Breners-Le.
Bernard Van: A religious event that won Victoria’s shadow in World War I
The only religious person in the English church who won, their college, in Victoria during World War I was at an event held in his hometown, 100 years after winning.
Lieutenant Bernard Van won Victoria on September 29, 1918 for his participation in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehocourt.
However, he was killed by a four-day postcard and never found out that he had won the highest British display.
The victory stone has been exposed by both of its enemies, at a stand at the head of the Jordan, in northern Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his colleagues, Michael Van, said that the discovery of the stone was just 100 after his grandfather won the sign of excellence.
According to the London Guzette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his bridge and crossed the San Cantan plant "The Way to a heavy fog and heavy fire in a field and a two-car."
Then he speeded up the fireline and the "most great berets" led the line forward before we were quick to take one hand over the sub-carrier and drop three out of the pool.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German peak on October 4, 1918, one month before the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be compared to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a stranger after the scene, which led to the Brantwood royal youth orchestra.
Michael Van said that he felt "very honored to take part in the scene" and added "the hero of my mother's hero is shown with the support of many people."
The inter-communicado Artists stayed awake all night to watch the 206, and instead they got the Pepe Pieg.
Imagine that you've been staying awake all night to watch Baltor 206's case and finally watch the main event of your fallout.
The plan provides a contract with 13 battles, including six on the main card, and a live display during the night at channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
On 6:00 a.m., just when Jared Musssey and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, the observers in Britain stayed shocked when the visit changed to Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after they remained awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the move to the video for children as a kind of sick joke.
“It's about a government correction that was in the 6th morning that the original device was not suitable and therefore they had to go to the children's plans”, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication in Laator, when we asked about the transmission.
"Page Pig, yeah."
President Baltor, Scott Cucker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the future British viewers.
"I think when I think about the back transmission, I think we can sort it out," said Cucker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. in the morning there and we can't solve the problem until the day of our time, i.e. on the day of their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me that during the past, many text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time this isn't gonna happen.
We're only cleaning up five fights instead of six -- like we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and just ordered.
It's a matter of lack of luck."
Tom Desert Island Discs: Tom Dially felt a landing 'cause of his sexual orientation
Tom Dili, the Olympic jump to the water, said at the time of his youth he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation - but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he came to the middle kidnapping that "not everyone like me."
In an interview given on the Desert Island Discs, of the Radio Channel 4, at Lauren's suggestion to Oren, he said that the expression on the issue of homosexual rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that being a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympic games.
The usual offer of the Vatican program, Christy Young, went out on sick leave in a few months.
In his appearance as the first plan star of Lauren, Dili said that he felt the other ones as they grew up that it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, you feel inferior, and you feel different, there were some real things that gave me strength and power and let me succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out what his sexual inclination was.
The man who won twice in the Olympic War School became the hot lead of the U.S. Community campaign and used his participation in the game of members of the British People in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexualism.
He made it clear that he felt lucky that he had given him the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The third winner of the World Alliance said that the love of a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "Kid me in surprise."
Dale married Oscar's winner, 20 years old, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much young" - he first took part in Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone who had a similar age with similar cost and dropouts.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dili, and Dili said his "all point of view" was changed.
"If you were asking me last year, everything turned around, I had to win the gold medal," he said.
You know what, there's something bigger than gold flags.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with cancer in his brain.
Dili said his father didn't accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to the Olympic games in London in 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first row.
I couldn't tell him she wouldn't be here to be in the first row, he said.
"I held his hand while his breath was gone, and only when he stopped really breathing and I finally realized that he wasn't unsuccessable," he said.
A year later, Dili gave up on the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red Medal.
I just knew that I've been dreaming for the rest of my life -- turning in front of a crowd in the Olympic games, not feeling better than anything else, he said.
That's also what he's given an inspiration to choose his first song - a "Proud" of the "R" Smol" that he went on during the Olympic games and still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs from BBC's 4th radio on Sunday at 11:15, according to the British summer clock.
Michaelson was disappointed in the performance, and he went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American golf player Phil Michaelson will make a record on the day when he plays the 47th time at the Reider hat, but he's gonna have to broadcast the performances so that the event won't turn into a miserable idea.
Michaelson, who participated in the 12th year's post and applied for a record, went down to the ladder according to the decision of G.P.P.R. during the football and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as a player in games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Meyger Tour, passed half the day as a cheerleader and half the other part of the game on his game in hopes of repairing the ill that he suffered.
As a result, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Gulf National, where the long-term lawns are not usually forgiven by mistake sections.
And if the competition itself isn't refreshing enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on the day of A's, a argument against the true champion of British, Francesco Molinari, who cooperates with the player that starts with Tommy Flywood and wins all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points at the beginning of 12 alone games, were to succeed in the first steps, Michaelson's game could have been a player.
Fairrick showed confidence in his player, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, put me on my back, wrapped his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fairrick.
He has a lot of self-esteem.
He's a member of the Hall of Praise and adds a lot to these teams before, and the week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it evolved and that's how we thought we should continue.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on the day.
This might end his career at Ryder Hill, which you will never really measure up to his personal rules.
Michaelson's reward is 18 wins, 20 losses and seven skirts, although Fairrick said his presence added some uninvisible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, Sreksty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's likely to be with him in the laundry room," he explains.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It's got a lot beyond the game itself."
The European Captain Thomas Byron knows that the great advantage might disappear soon.
Thomas Bjourn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before last day in Ryder's only games can change evil.
The Danish player started his game at the Wallederama in 1997, when a son of Zugo to the game, Captain Balstrus, had a 5-point advantage on Americans, who almost lost the finish line when he crossed the finish line with a forest advantage and won 141-1312.
I continue to remind myself that we had a great advantage in Walderama; that we had a great advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and the Valderama in which we won but with the advantage of my forest," said Brian, in the picture, after watching the victory in 5-3, in Turn 2018 they were the day and 'and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 bluff golf.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on this team that's not over.
We need to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on the track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the points don't appear on the board.
We have a goal, trying to win the finger, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Byron was happy with his players on the hard track and added: "I think you never put the late one forward.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as golf player is on the test.
And that's the message you need to deliver: you need to produce the best of yourselves tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving the couple behind, and he's got to make the best of himself."
Unlike Beveran, the captain of the opposite team is going to expect personal performances better than his players, compared with their team games, except for Jordan Spey and Stan Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fairrick himself knows the winning side and the losing side, during the important end days of this type of tortoise, after participating in the winner's team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team was selected to win a miracle in the finish game, as stated in the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word and every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Carsenso, in 1999, encouraged his game for the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the first stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this montium goes to one of the sides, it's running a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're making our car in line and getting the guys on course according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas took the task of trying to lead the fight and he's going to face Rory McCallroy in the party game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ream, Tommy Pletwood and Ian Paulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the upper grade.
"I chose this group of players that's okay because I think he'd be able to bring us to the finish," said Bourne when he was dealing with his only choice.
The arrival of the new German warship was denied again
Germany's new fleet project was supposed to be accepted in 2014 to replace the advanced warships from the time of the cold war, but it was denied at least a year, as a result of mass systems and outbreaks, reported local media.
Rheinland-Palaz, the pilot ship on the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class line, has now been denied to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper's report, rather than a statement by a military reporter.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but concerned types after the supply closed the roll on the FBI project.
All four Bund-Wüerttemberg-Class, which was ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-Class project.
It is expected that they would have included a powerful cannon, anti-ship rockets, as well as advanced technologies, such as ecostic signatures, inferno-denomia, and dispersal radar.
Other important features, including longer maintenance periods, can be discussed for up to two years from home.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships – which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops across the sea – will become obsolete by the moment of their entry into service, have been kind of observed.
The F125 reputation came to titles last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to build ships after its flight.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media has recorded a number of critical licoy and materials that have made the warship useless to use as a battle mission.
The software cores were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class vessels would be operated by about 120 mills - as half of the team that used in the older Pragues, from the Bremen Class.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has an extra dramatic weight that reduces its performance and limits its ability to add future needs.
The weight of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz is 7,000 tons, and it's two times as heavy as ships of a kind that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the hocology program, the project rule's price label -- which included team training -- has also become a problem.
It was reported to be a terrible height of 3.1 billion iro ($3.6 billion) - beyond the original 2.2 billion iro.
The problems that fill the most new projects become especially thoughtful by the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine power melts.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, the head of the German Parliament's Security Committee, confirmed today's Marine Forces "Fairs of ships capable of carrying out a operation."
The official source said that the problem had developed momentum and growth over time, since old ships had been taken out of service but had not been replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his sorrow that there was no way for the Navy even a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class project.
Scotland's National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the mansion in Hariris, Scotland, was about to reveal how bats used to hunt food.
Hope is that the founders will renew the behavior of the unique flying whales and help to preserve the future.
The study that scientists at the National Institute of Scotland follow up on excellent bats and European telephones, as well as the warm dovanton bats and the long ears in Guinea-Irbreo-Bowster Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key sites around the property to track bat activity throughout the year.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also perform mobile screens by hand detectors.
An in-depth voice analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat readings and who understand the species in charge of them.
At the next stage, the living area map is set up to create a detailed picture of the size of the image, of their behavior patterns.
Most Dower, a nature conservation counselor for the National Fund of Scotland (NTS) hopes that the results will find out which areas of life are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to measure the benefits of managing the living areas, such as the creation of a brother’s country and how to maintain the forest area best for bats and other species.
The bat populations in Scotland and all over Britain have been significantly reduced during the previous century.
They are subjected to the threat of development and construction, affecting the balance and the loss of living areas.
Spirit and enlightenment can also be dangerous, and it is also true about the trap of flies and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic assaults.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting legs, bat ears are more useful than anything to catch prey.
They use sophisticated DNA detection techniques to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight route.
The NTS fund, which is responsible for treating over 270 historical buildings, 38 important genes and 760,000 species of earth all over the country, is very serious about bats.
She's got 10 professional experts, who perform scans, cannon tests and sometimes rescue.
The organization also set up the first seal and the dedicated unit for bats in the Tare of Demprez and Galavi, which is used for eight of Scotland's 10 species of bats.
The director of the D.O.O.D. said the percentage is the ideal territory for them.
Here's a 'rev' we have a great area for the bats', he said.
We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the right areas of life.
But many things are still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand more what they need to do to thrive."
He stressed the importance of examining the need to find the bats before performing maintenance tasks in the property, since the uninvented destruction of a single house could destroy up to 400 women and boys, and possibly destroy a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and killing, harassment and interruption of bats or the destruction of their canine areas, prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Freel, a Soviet officer at the mercy of the bats, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: "We have much more to learn about our bats and many of our species. We just don't know what their population situation is."
Ronaldo cancels the rape charges while the lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the charges of rape against him "Pick News", and said that people want to advance themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine, which published the charges.
The replacement of the Portuguese and Wentus team is accused of rape by an American woman named Kat 'Rein Meorga, in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
According to the suspicion, he later paid her $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, reporting Dr. Spiegel on a day and a day.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million followers in Instagrum in video and lived a few hours after the prosecution, and called Buz for reports "Pike News".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, said to the camera the player who won in the light hotel five times.
They want to advance themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good." Add the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Schegel for the charges, which were considered to be a "explicable report on private suspicions", according to the Reuters report.
The lawyer Christian Shertz said that the player would ask for damages on “subject damage to the amount of the breach, and this is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years.”
The incident apparently occurred on the average in June 2009 at the suite of the Casino Palms Hotel in Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Meorga returned, according to the report, to the player's room and the player had allegedly raped her, according to documents registered in the Clark County District Court in Nova.
Maorgia claims that Rolando fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he was a "good guy" in the "99 percent" that disappointed in "one percent."
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed.
Maorgia also claims that she appeared to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken out of the hospital, but then she agreed to arrange outside the court office because she felt “wounded by acts of revenge” and was afraid to be publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old girl says she's now interested in canceling the order because she's still suffering a trauma because of the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Riel from Madrid at the time of the likely attack, and he went to the Italian Euvantus club in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brakezite: Britain will regret forever 'on the loss of car manufacturers
Britain's gonna regret forever if you lose the world's leading car manufacturer position after the Braksite, said Britain's minister of business, Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota's interview to BBC, where he said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, she would temporarily stop the construction at the factory in Branston, near Darby, was "Madig".
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the effects on the borders of Burksite's case without an agreement could rise in service.
The factory in Branston - which produces the models of Oris and howantis of Toyota - produces close to 150,000 cars last year and over 90% of you travel to the rest of the European Union.
"At my point of view, if Britain leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, we'll see the end of our factory, "Morwin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Bernston."
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom caused concerns about the move of the European Union without agreement and how it will affect the cross-border trade, including India, BMW, Vigor Land Rober.
BMW, for example, says she'll close her mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Braksite.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risk of the supply chain in the case of Braksite without agreement.
Toyota's design line is managed on a "right time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes, supplying British and the rest of the European Union, to create cars according to the order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it could cause them to cross the border, and cause them to cross the border saying that they could lead to a slowdown and a lack of parts.
Toyota can't keep a full stock of more than one day at a factory in Darbishir, says the company, so the creation will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Cres" program, which separates Britain's future relationship with the European Union, was "acquired to prevent these tests at the border."
We need to reach the best agreement we can make, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity", he said in Today's 4th radio channel on the B.B.C.
“Reveals of waste and other vehicle manufacturers are the possibility of continuing to use the successful value of the supply chains, which we have to date, is absolutely essential.”
Toyota didn't say how long it would last, but for the longer term, she warned that the addition of the costs would harm the factory contests and eventually lead to fired.
Peter Kübbararis, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years, serving as the President of the United States Union in the factory, said that the union's members are more and more concerned: "My experience, if the services are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government speaker said: “We have proposed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be re-dismissed, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is dependent on her, may be "adverting another week" when he was approaching the Supreme Court, Bert Quano, continues to say, "The White House" on the day of 1 January.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Miller, who investigates the Russian involvement in the elections, links between the Tramp and Russia's assistants, and possible doubts about the follow-up by the President.
The acquisitions in Washington have been a deal for months on the question of whether Trump would fire the Attorney General and thereby endanger the independence of Miller.
Earlier the month, the New York Times reported that Rosentine Dan could carry a tracking device to record the calls with Trump and make the President's announcement through the 25th revision of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day, he came to the White House, and according to the reports he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting was held for the day of the "Tramp", which was held at the time of Rosenstein's arrival in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a conflict with the hearing at the Senate's Legal Committee, where he was led by Quano and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blysey Ford.
On day and day, Trump ordered an investigation of the FBI for a week about the claims against Quano, and again rejected the vote in the Senate.
Trump's reporter, Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News channel on the day of the day.
In reply to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “We haven't set a date for the meeting yet, she may be here this week, and I can see a denial another week considering what is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some writings will be discussed on this case: Sanders has not been in the White House press since September 10.
Chris Wallace the offer asked why.
Sanders said that the courses were rarely influenced by the "post cleaning" of the TV writers, although they said, "I will not deny the fact that they're taking a stand."
She then offered to increase the direct connection between Trump and the press.
“The President is more likely to meet questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding without referring to evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
The press instructions are still in place, says Sanders, but if the press has an opportunity to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than to talk to me.
We have tried to do so on many occasions, and we have seen that we have done so on many occasions in the past few weeks, and meeting with the President of the United States, will change the media."
Trump regularly answers questions about when he leaves the white house or when he attends open meetings or for public reasons when he is in honour.
Only his press parties are rare.
This week in New York, the President may have considered the reason for this, at a free display and at times strange in front of reports collected in a place.
The Health Service writes to the European Union workers in NHS Scotland and in relation to concerns about Barksite.
The Health Service wrote to the European Union staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they stay after the Braksite.
Superintendent Gin Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain came out of the European Union.
The Scotian government has already committed itself to standing up for citizens of the European Union working in its diverse public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: “By the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the European Union regarding the continued exit, and he is moving forward to the expected decisions of the fall.
But the British government, too, has made the call for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this period may be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each team member, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and from all parts of the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercombi is undergoing emergency surgery after he has had a headache.
The rear guard of the Tansey University, Christion Abercombi, had an emergency operation after he had been injured by loss 31-27 on Saturday to the Comodorez group at the University of Wendreblette, reported Mike Organ from the Tanzania.
Rod Reid, the lead coach of the Tansey university team, told the writers that the injury caused a short time before the half.
"He went to the bottom of the field and just collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical team gave Abercombi oxygen on the back of the field and then put it on the alanca and take it for another test.
Officer at the University of Tansay told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville Bethnnessy, that Barkombe was transferred to surgery at the Wenderblat Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/limit of surgery" and the University of Tansay is still trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercombi is an intel student and this is his first season with the University of Tansay after his transfer from Malinoy.
He's been participating in five files just before he gets out of the game, and he's put his bags up for 18.
Foreign buyers will commit to higher stamps when you buy property in Britain
Foreign buyers will commit higher stamps during purchase of property in Britain and the addition of funds to help homeless people, according to the new conservation plan.
The move will reduce Corbin's success of moving to attract new voters.
Bullet tax calculations take place on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The treasure expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will commit to a higher rate of tax bells when we buy property in the United Kingdom -- the addition of incomes will be used to help homeless people, declare Teresa May today.
The move seems to be an entrance to neutralize the success of the move of Jeremy Corbin to attract young voters, with promises to provide a cheaper place and focus on higher incomes.
No. Bullets will be charged with people and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, and the addition of revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those who are in difficult circumstances.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current ball tax, including higher tax levels on two locations and real estate investments for wages, may reach up to 3 percent.
The treasure expects the move to take up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the new assets built in London are purchased by foreign residents, the situation in which the prices are rising and the first ones to acquire assets to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas in the country -- and especially in the capital -- have become the ghosts because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for an end in the ballbox to help young people get a first house.
He accused large building companies of the precious property prices, since they are land-grabbing but not using them, and the effort to abandon the house-to-house charges at a reasonable price and to correct Britain's "loose-off".
Corbin has announced a series of technical details proposed in the area of housing, including supervision of rent and the pedagogical "no guilt".
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new houses.
May say, last year, I said that I would dedicate my priestly period to the British dream universe, which they denied is that life should be better for every new generation.
And the meaning of this is to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not true that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and companies that are located in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as British workers.
The dream of becoming homeowners has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleep under difficult conditions is too real."
My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
"His ultimate ambition" was to become the Director of Scotland at a certain point.
The 42-year-old Scotty enjoys the challenge of the Nort-Ist club, now located in the third place in the first three league, three points from the top of the grade.
He went to the summer light stadium after he led St. Meren back to the first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in an international game, and that's it, Ross said to the Soco-Sportsund social BBC program.
But when I was growing up, I watched the Scotland team play a lot of ambaden with my father as a child, and it was always something that kept me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I can manage the team."
The former directors of Sunderland include Dick Adbokett, David Moiss, Sam Elredis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Cain, Gus Foy, and Paulo D'Kano.
The former president of Alewa Attic says that he was not afraid to come after such based names in such a large club, after he had previously rejected Barnsley's suggestions and the "Town".
"For me, success right now will be taught by "Can I bring the club back to Permier League?"
Because of the structure and the facilities in this club, he certainly belonged to Permier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a period as an assistant in Damburton and 15 months as a team coach of Heaths.
At the next stage, he helped Ala to get out of Magga C and raised St. Merren from the window to a position as the last of her days.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartelpoli, Polrick, St. Myren and the Metalon Academy.
"It was probably a true command," he recalls, about the failure of the command of a god.
I really believed that the management position was better than the game.
That sounds weird because I played fine, I've probably earned, and I've enjoyed some reasonable style.
But a player's career can be hard.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with everything about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt comfortable with myself as an adult."
You can listen to a full interview at the Sportfound, on September 30, the Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British summer clock.
The perfect time for Pint beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in a survey.
The heavy heat wave of British pubs struggling on their existence, but caused stress in restaurant networks.
Groups of boabs and beers enjoyed an elevator at prices of 2.7 percent in July -- but the incomes at restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, revealed the data.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Counsel, who brought out the data, said: “The meaning of continuing to the clear weather and the long-term participation of England in the world's goals is that July was similar to June's, as the Cuban incomes rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered from even more severe strikes.
The decline in the rate of 1.8% in the restaurants you saw in June was just a forced-out in July.
Robbies and houses that focus on drinks have recorded the most powerful performances, with a higher growth than the incomes in restaurant business, compared to the previous time.
Fabbies who focused on food also suffered from the sun, although they were in less dramatic conditions than restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to get a drink.
In the war of the pub and bell networks, 6.6 percent of the sales of drinks rose during the month, and the food sales fell 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM data-processing team from the Fennel and the Eugry Department, said: “These results continue the level we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sports events or social events are the most important factors in relation to the housing market outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, but that a drop of 4.8 percent in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful for all half of the regular costs.
The long summer and the heat could not have arrived at a worse moment for the food-oriented businesses, and the time would tell if the more privileged temperatures we've experienced in August would be able to distribute what they need so much."
The growth rate in sales, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and the drop in brands.

One out of five kids has accounts in social media that they hide from their parents
A survey revealed that one of five children - some 11 - have secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey, with a total of 20,000 middle school students, revealed a tumor in my hands, "a fake instinct."
The big news is concerned about a publication of sexual content.
20 percent of the students said they have a "head" account that they show to parents
One out of five children — some 11 years of age — creates accounts in social media that he keeps secret from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid rise in false "instanta" accounts as a reminder of the photo sharing site, Instagrum.
The big news is concerned about a publication of sexual contents.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "head" account to show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that she was asking others to beat me.
The study, conducted by the Digital Awards UK and the HMC of the British Independent Schools, found 40 percent of the students aged 11 to 18 to have two professors and their happinesss acknowledge that they have private accounts.
HMC head, Mike Buchanan, said: “It bothers so many teenagers who are so eager to create space where parents and teachers can't find them.”
Ilyde Doyle will be used as a voice for the Athletes at the Scotty Athletes.
Ilyde Doyle was elected to the Socottts' secretariat for an external architecture at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the hottest athlete and the head of Ian City described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who offer the sports to benefit from the rich mania at the international level over the last decade.
"Ilyde has won a great honor in the Czech, British, and world-wide chain community, and we are sure that the Scots will benefit greatly from your father's directory," he said, "Bity.
Doyle said: “I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and really help with sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlantic, and the four Olympic gold medals in all, and now used continuously as a parachute at B.B.C., lost his ability to go after he suffered a brain stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if he was sick or how much.
It was a hard job, but I totally dreamed, and I've learned how to go and now perform rapid and reactive exercises!
Thank you for the cheerleaders!
Public awareness of the importance of milk supplies that compare motherhood to that of a webcaster
A friend of Felga milk supplying online ideas that compares motherhood to that of a cow.
To point out the burden field that must be "the silent milk pump given to the first public in the world", Elvie's private user technology company published a morphist video to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new resource gives to mothers.
Four mother-in-laws dance in a cow-fibre barn full of seed to sing words like, "Yes, I'm dreaming of myself, but you can't see tail" and "in case you haven't noticed, it's not my breasts."
The song is continuing and says, "Suppose, chubbeth, I feed the babies, the doves, the doves, I'm diving my girls."
But the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused a online dispute.
With 77,000 observers and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from the audiences, and many said it sheds light on the milk industry.
“ The decision is very bad to use fruit to spread the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and have a baby to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in a few days after the escape, and she wrote someone.
Elvie's milk pump is mixed with discs within the olvie/Mother bra.
Another response said: “Tromaly, clearly, to form a circle and circle as one.
But, hey, why don't you use them to spread a mother milk pump that's worth keeping their babies?"
Another response said: "A completely cut-off publication."
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "a laugh. "
I think it's a geniusic idea.
I'd buy one if I'd still clean up.
The disease made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I've referred to her.
It's a genius product, wrote someone.
Another response said: It's a funny commercial intended for mothers who are (once close to their places of work or in the bathroom) and who are as sensitive as “pertures”.
It's not an awareness that you're playing or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group finds that they've all been running with the digital loads in their fronts.
The idea that behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women use in milk supply say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's load is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it's dissociated in the clean-up bra and gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out during the fall.
Anna Blarin, her partner, and her responsibility for the early development department in the Morter noted: "The Elvie resource is such a product that she has received a bold and procrastinative potion.
In the creation of a comparison between women who hurt themselves and women who are lepers, we wanted to put the milk’s pain and all the challenges in which it is in the light of the lightning, and to manifest in a orderly manner, which can be perceived, the remarkable freedom that the new resource will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's case makes headlines.
During London's fashion week, mother of two kids walked the path for the designer Martha Jacobosky using the product.
Hundreds of my immigrant children were safely transferred to camp at Texas border
The number of immigrant children in Zawk custody, although the number of half the monthly border remains relatively unchanged, one reason is that the director of the Trump has insisted that the children be transferred to the care center.
Usually, the majority of the caregivers were immigrants without their own documents, and they were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by submitting to responsibility for a child.
The men risk June, when the federal authorities announce that the years of potential protection and other adult household members will have to deliver prints, and these channels will be associated with immigration authorities.
Last week, he died, a senior immigration and tax official, testified to the Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had applied for protection to young people without supervision.
The permission was subsequently granted 70 percent of the detainees had not been criminal before.
About 80 percent of the beneficiaries of relief or homelessness are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albans.
With a view to treating children more quickly, officials have introduced new laws that require a part of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days after the previous regulations, the shelter workers have reported.
Many will appear by means of a video conference, instead of face-to-face, to present their case to a legal judge for immigration matters.
Those who will not be entitled to release will be forced out quickly.
The longer these children remain in care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this situation could lead to violent outbreaks or run-off attempts, said the campkeepers and reports that have been posted from the system in the last few months.
Councils say that these concerns are getting higher in larger facilities like Turinello, where signs of the child's problems are likely to be removed because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a city without giving them enough time to plan emotionally or to separate from friends could make the trauma that many have been coping with.
Syria tells the American, French and Turkish forces to retreat too far.
In her face of the U.S. general arrest, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wallyd Al-Mulse called for the secret refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in her eighth year.
Dismissed, the president, too, the Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were on the ground of Syria illegally, under the excuse that they were fighting terrorism, and would be dealt with accordingly.
"They have to retreat too far and without conditions," he said to arrest.
Dismissed, the War in Terrorism almost ended in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been visited from their homes.
He said that Dakek would continue to fight this holy battle until we cleansed the secret land from terrorist organizations and all illegal alien presences that she was as one.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in need of training and advice for the Korean forces and the prisoners opposed to the President of Israel-Al-Asad.
France has over 1,000 warriors on the country's land under war.
As to the type of crime, he said that the conditions for their return are good and the victims of "some Western states" in the "discreet outbreak" that led to crimes being kept away.
"We called the international community and the humanitarian organizations to help them come back," he said.
They're making politics for a kind that's supposed to be romantic only."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria's reconstruction assistance will not be sent until there is no political agreement between Asad to Yugoslavia to end the war.
The U.S. diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up an ice zone in Adeleve, from the last major rebel scene, created an opportunity to advance in the political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkic agreement prevented the massive attack of the secret forces in support of the Russians on the province, where three million people lived.
However, the focus of the agreement was on "extreme end dates" and expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the war of the Yaad, and on all the win-wins related to the Al-Qaida organization, which will be destroyed.
The U.S. messenger Stephen de Mestaura hopes to attend the first meetings of a new committee, which will be composed of members of the government and of the opposition, to put in place the law of the post-war and pave the way for election.
He ignored the conditions for the participation of the secret government in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to “the focus of the present constitution”, and warned of the intervention.
Why Trump Wins the Second Continuity
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberians look forward to, rejection and scandal will be completed in advance.
While there is no doubt the most dramatic conclusion in the history of the presidency at all times!
Right now, there's no signs of fatigue at the audiences.
Since 2014, the percentages of the peaks of the peaks have risen to 1.05 million observers in C.N.N. and almost cost themselves to 1.6 million observers in MSNBC.
The average of Fox News stands at 2.4 million in record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nilssen, and the "Rich'l Madow" show conducted by MSNBC, has reached the lead of cable-raying with up to 3.5 million watching important news.
"It's the fire that people are drawn because it's not something we understand," said Neal Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, which works at a state secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the beer.
Lonne Scouble, writing old comedy and "Only the funny parts" and some hard truths about sneezing into the Hollywood men's circle" have a different theory.
She remembers a cab trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he's kidding me," told me Ms. 'Scobel.
It has value in my hands.
Of course, in all other TV programs, the vacation lines from Washington could determine the future of the "Ro v. Weed" ruling, could immigrant families reunify and the health of the world's economy.
Change of channel or neglect is a gift that only the most relevant viewers can afford.
And yet, you're running out of control when you find yourselves in the panel of legal experts for six hours, using Bob Woodward as the source of the story of fear, "The Bubbers is worth $15,000 worth of Paul Manport ("in full-barried betrayment", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the historical descriptions of St. Daniels on, and forgiveness of the Bithoy, the Intimacy of Trump.
I'll never, for example, look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does, the same feeling as the one of a reality show, that he's feeding you on something every night”, said Bert Montgomery, president of the Wehlhouse International and author of the "His History for sales", about the team that replaced the Trump show and the daily turnout of the government (war with the NFL League, crediting Guong-on).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the northern coast of the Kawei, but it was a challenge to watch the MSNBC, and it recorded the CNN.
He couldn't disengage, not when Bert Quano was preparing to stand in front of the Senate's legal committee and the future of the Supreme Court is on the agenda.
"I remember the times when we had all these crazy performances before and people said "This is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Places told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

External source funds are waiting for the race to be elected to the middle of the lowest canon.
Not surprisingly, the 17th province of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganisation of Congress, which brought two Congressmen race on the same seat.
The District, a professor of Pitsburg, who recently re-entered the Democratic Representative Connor to Amb, who won his residence in another province, at special elections in the last spring.
Umb ran against another Congress member, Republican Keith Ruth Poss, who today represents the 12th province of Pennsylvania, which has been greatly influenced by the boundaries of the new province 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the earlier provinces were divided into evil, and contrary to the Constitution, the results for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district is a battle from financial shocks on the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic campaign committee (DCCC) and the Republican campaign committee (NCRC).
Umb became famous in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March, which won a broad view of the 18th Congress in Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point district.
Political principles have seen an easy advantage for Democrats.
The United States was able to punish Al Salvador for supporting China, and then retreated.
Diplomatics indicated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met in Beijing, with easy resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos and Carla, in June 2017, and he held a hotel in Panama until his partners divorced the Tamp company's management team.
The foreign officials decided to return the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama as a response to the last decisions not to be known in Taiwan, said Dr. Norret, spokesperson of the Office, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the sentence was only imposed against El Salvador, which, according to the estimate, was paid $140 million from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties offered, including cuts in financial assistance and limitations focused on entry securities, could have hurt the country from the Americas center afflicted by unemployment and high murder.
In the course of the internal meetings, officials from the North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic success so much as last year’s meeting that took place as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior officials made their wish for the promotion of the conference clear and thus completed all the prejudices against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Fence is now supposed to address the conference participants, who are currently appointed for the Octabre media, as a symbol of the importance of the administration, said the diplomats.
And three American missionaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Bulton's white house speaker refused to respond to the private opinion of the three American officials, and in all, two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal debate, on the condition that they remain in that state.
Their explanations were made by an external, close-to-machine, analist, who also spoke out there.
They learn history
The next clear statement may come from the report of the Special Adviser Robert Miller on the alleged search of Trump, whose backs now have significant evidence of public records.
Moreer turns his investigation, according to the reports, to ask whether Trump's campaign of election cooperated with Russia in attacks on our election system.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself giving justice and accountability to this body, just as soon as he is ready to stand before the voters again, and perhaps even before a jury.
There are a lot of questions that begin with "M" and I'm not meant to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even of the duty-holders who've been assigned to him in Europe.
From both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been ready to act as a revenge against Hitler, if only the West would have opposed him and supported him by the leaders of your country.
We failed, and we missed a chance to prevent the deadly years that resulted.
History moves around such points, and the democracy initiative that has not been stopped, shaken, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such points.
What do we do if Trump gets rid of Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this press reported last year that he offered to secretly record the president and raised the gates about his misunderstanding to the president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was not accurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I investigation on the subject of Bert Quano, who recently requested, is not full or fair -- or if he approves the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false charges?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the canon and become a secret Congress on Trump's responsibilities?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter season.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew who was assigned to Oswech by the Nazi police, who also had a lamb in the old house that I had.
She survived, emigrated to America and then 60 years later, sent me to light a Saturday candle on the same table that carried the ice cream.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

A knee wound prevented Graham Dorans from first encountering the season until the 2-2 with Viral, but he believed that the Ring 'rers could use this result as a jumping ground for better performances.
"It was a good point for us because Viral is a good team," said 31-year-old football.

We could have won at the end, but, by the end of all, the case was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were out of the Cape Town in the second half, and we were the best team.
Thursday's gonna be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game because they got a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive outcome.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The good team and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, only a few people were talking about it with their family members.
As half of the participants in the Nationwede survey said they were talking to the zoomen about the cost of long-term supportive treatment.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they don't take action to conduct the conversation," said Holly Schneider, president of the company for Nationwede Life Insurance.
You can do it next time.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare the family for the treatment if you don't express your wishes long before the deadline.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, since these choices may be a significant factor in cost-effectiveness.
The consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term symposia may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy for life insurance with a sum of money that will help cover expenses, or insurance with your money -- as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early solution to legal struggles at this opportunity.
They have found from among them a power for health, a trusted man who is responsible for your medical treatment and makes sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
They've also been able to sign up on any kind of power in relation to your money.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions in your place and ensure payment of accounts if you are not qualified.
Don't forget the little details: imagine your adult parent has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs or allergys?
We mentioned these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"The financial side is not the only point of importance, but also of which are doctors?"
What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan."

Palo and Dungella have been hit several times by the waves of the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian agency to ease disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Angola.
A Nazi wave also hit the West Angola in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the zone of the Pacific fire ring, known for its seismic activity and is hit in the way determined by earthquakes.
In front of you, some of the largest ground and mountain peaks in the last few years:

Federal prosecutions are asking for a rare death penalty to suspect a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York ask for a death penalty for Sipolo Sipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City who killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Siopov was used according to the claim in the May Depo's truck to make a bike attack on the side of the fast West Side road in south of Manhattan, and a foot and a bike driver on his way to October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the claims must prove that Sypov first killed the eight victims and caused “firstly” severe injuries to the body, according to the statement of intent to request the death penalty, which was made in the South of New York.
According to the court's document, death penalty can be imposed on these two accused persons.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury for Siopov, with a 22-hour indictment, including eight charges of murder in a smuggling aid, usually used federal claims in cases of organized crime, violent and vandalized vehicles.
The injured asked for “significant planning first and foremost”, said the authors, and described the way that the victim was injured as “suffering, cruel and sick”.
“Syphipolo Avibbitz caused injury, damage and loss to their families and friends of Diego Annarika Anglyni, Nicholas Klabbs, Ann-Lour Deddek, Darn Drake, Ariel Erlich, Rennan Procho, Harnan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pinoco, ” was written in the statement of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the South quarter of New York was sued with a death penalty in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but we were finally sentenced to a world prison in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and El Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after their conviction asked for a divorce for the Council ' s alliance during the two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the Court's documents, Siepov, born of Ozbakisten, he did not express regret over the days and months after the injury.
He made it clear to the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said police.
Sypopov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack after watching his cell phone TVs, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of sedash in the hospital room where he was.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-year-old reporter.
David Patton, one of the federal honours representing Sipov, said they were "probably disappointed" in the prosecution decision.
"We think the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt that leads to a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events on all those involved," said Patton.
Sypov's Sangory Team has previously requested non-quantity claims for the death penalty.
A member of the Parliament, Marnie, says that he's got to buy Niegi L. Farug as the responsibility for the negotiations with Barczytte.
The Nig La Prague promised to recruit the people's army today during a protest at the guard's conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said that politicians had to feel under pressure from the aerocaptics - when a member of Theresa Mayi's Guard Party claimed he had to be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Deputy Prime Minister Peter Bon said that she was acting in Bramingham that Britain was already out at this point if Prague had been serving as secretary of the Brakezite.
But the challenge facing him is Mei, pius of the very divided lines of the guards, expressed by the membership of the guards who supported the stay of the European Union to display a different attitude against the Braksite in the city.
The head of government is struggling to leave her release plan, the Czars, on the way, despite attacks by the Barksite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The British have been trying to keep trying to reach an agreement with Bryssel despite counter-actions - and force the engagements and the Liber Party to choose between its agreement and the Huho and Boho.
Boone said at the meeting of the Leave Mens Leave in Solihuol that he wanted to break up from 'Cres'.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out at this point, he said.
I'm gonna protect Barksite, but we need to say good-bye to 'Cres'.
He emphasized his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn cancelled the claim that the audience's opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: the idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain completely false.
The secretary Parliament and the support of the Braksite and Andrea G. Kinkins were also active and said to the writers: "I say openly: the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The KK program is not popular among the wider public, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular in our party and among our activists who went out on the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, let go of the chrys and start listening.
In a review of May, she added: "The heads of government are keeping their duty when they make their promises."
Ferg' said at the conference that he should make politicians feel the pressure if they're about to betray the fact that they're getting on the question of the people in 2016.
It's now about the question of trust between us, the people, and our political status, he said.
They're trying to betray Barksite and we're here today to tell them.
He added, in a message to the crowd: "I want you to make our political position, which is about to break down in Brakezite, feel under pressure.
We call this country's people's army, which has given us the victory in Burksite and will never rest until we become independent, independent and proud Britain.
At that moment, the remaining supporters walked in Bramingham and then had a two-hour-old assembly in the center of the city.
A group of active people were exploded in anti-Brexite announcements after the team was set up at the end of the week.
The Lord Lord Lord Lord Masters is a witness to the opening of the security issues that they have suffered with the party app.
It's about people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology that makes it possible to establish an agreement like Canada plus plus, to cross a border without waiting and trading without borders in Ireland, he added.
It's totally ridiculous.
There's no such thing as a good barxite, he added.

Grand Perry Russia: Louis Milton finishes with a world title after the group's revolutions gave him a victory over Sebastian Walt.
It was clear, from the moment that Walter Botas was down to the next stage before Louis Milton on Saturday, that Mardez group radios would play an important role in the race.
For the first time, Lotus had a good start and he almost left Milton alone when he protected his place on the first two rounds and invited Walt to attack his friend.
Walt first came out to the middle and let the millelon get involved in the movement of the competing tail, a decision likely to be reached.
The Marsads team went out to the middle of a later round and returned to a race behind Walt, but Milton moved forward after a tight-rooted wheel fight that finally had to leave the inner path to hold safe after a double trip on the third corner.
Max and Rastapan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the rear line of the class and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.

President Donald Trump protested to Senator Diane Feinstein at the meeting on Saturday, in connection with her protesting that she did not leak a letter from Christine Balysey Ford, accused Bert Quano of the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
While speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to witnesses who gave Ford to the Senate's legal committee, and instead said that the Senate's lecture shows that people are "good and bad and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and angry, immoral and liars," he said.
When you look at the ads and suites, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Peinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you download the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added in the Senator's shots.
Fainstein received the charges against Quano more in July, and he was fined earlier in September, but she denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't cancel her story," said Finstein to the committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep his studio and to keep the secret of the letter as requested."
But it doesn't seem that the Senator's denial was received by the President, who responded to it during the meeting on Saturday evening: "I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she's not [flooding], but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continued to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by three women, and claimed that the Democrats used charges for their purposes.
They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the contempt, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're doing on the way to rule and power," said the President, according to Mediate's report.

Another black man?
A New York Spectator for Fithourin after transmission of a text "racial"
A New York husband's couple's divorce on a black background after he received a text that was not up to him from the mother who complained that the patient was "a black man."
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the prosecution to the Ripper.
Lanceis Flasco-Flexman, for two, was disappointed when she found out that her new kids, Giselle Morris, were black when it arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Morris twice.
According to the report of the New York Post, after paying attention to the oral investigation, Flasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, and said that the former therapist, who was out of the African-American, had done a bad job, and she was now expecting to pay a physical rent in her place.
Mrs. Morris got paid for one day's work and was sent to her house with Ober.
Now, Morris calls the couple on the piano, asking for $350 a day for six months of work and living where they were originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do things like that," she said to Post on a day and added "I know it's an illusion."
The couple returned a war on the claims that they were racist, and said that the end of Morris' business was requested out of fear that they couldn't trust her after they hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not raced," said her husband, "Wall Plasco to Post.
But did you play your child at the hands of someone who you were rude, even if it was an accident?
You're your tall baby?
Come on."
Palsco compared the prosecution to "sicking" and said his wife was supposed to have been born only two months before the event and she was "in a very difficult situation."
Do you want to pursue someone like her?
It's not nice to do anything like that, add investment bankers.
The case is still in the process, but the public court of opinion quickly raises the couple in social terms, and eliminates their conduct and the arguments they have used.

It's very funny to know now what we know about Pedington's great success."
After she said that her father, who worked in BBC, as a camera before the father inspired the book of children to write a small toy, it would become blood-blooding about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was "Marir-hot" after his death last year.
She added that her father was proud of his success, eventually of Pedington, which he described as a very important friend in our family.
"He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man," she said.
But because Pedington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a kid who got something: you're proud of him, even though it wasn't really because of you.
I think he saw Pedington's success like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Pedington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
After her landing, her daughter was transferred by boat to the hospital at Louis Peter 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
Said Mrs. Ednan Lafarus.
And then I got a call from Mand where he said she was about to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashie, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly and out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It's all gone.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it all happens.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Ms. Ednan-Loperus, now in Babylon on her daughter's loss, got on a plane beside other passengers who were unaware of the last noble journey.
Nobody knew," she said.
My head was empty, and tears dropped all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a sense of awe with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women are showing signs on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who killed themselves are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly the Hampez spoke on a Walsh bridge with inspired messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and he killed himself at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day." She said.
Davis, age 45, lived in Leideny, said her son was a promising chef with a stick.
They all recognized him because of his smile.
They've always said his smile shot every room."
But he stopped working before his death, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the same time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davies said: "I'm afraid without a break from a chain reaction."
Ms. Davies created the cameras, so people will know that there's someone that can be turned out and spoken, even if it's a friend.
- Don't sit in silence. - You need to talk."
Ms. Hampez, Mrs. Davis' girlfriend, lost Mark, partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the stage on Christmas Day when the kids opened the presents he didn't contact you with an eye or something.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they got over it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It turns us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Bert Cowano's future is at stake as the FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought, if we could really accept what asked for -- a time-limited and limited investigation -- we might be able to bring a little together," said Fleak on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "dispers" at the end of the inherited party.
Why were Koano and his Republican supporters not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their alarms are all coming from the timing.
The mid-Creation elections will be held only five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as an alternative, the Republicans will not succeed, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to bring to the choice of the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the Senators to try to support them in Kono, who worked at the White House for Bush and met with his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI takes out his report?
There's a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now serving.
It's still unclear whether Quano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so as to allow Vice President Mike Fence to break the equation and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of farmers in North Korea
North Korean Indians to South Korea have been down since Kim J.g.on went to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Park Bong-Sig, data from the South Korea Union office, said that last year the number of shots stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main causes of this were a review of the more remote borders between North Korea and China, and that they were in terms of people's escapes.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
Most of the farmers from North Korea eventually get South Korean citizens.
According to Saywell, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of Korea's war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, and they have north Korea’s longest border, which is easier to cross in comparison to the military area (DMZ) than between the two Korean countries.
China is referring to an illegal, criminal, and often restores them.
The relationship between the North and the South is still in the war -- it has improved dramatically over the past few months.
Earlier, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on negotiations on nuclear-weapon greening issues.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump and Kim, where the two agreed in general to act towards a time when the Korean side would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister Ri Young-ho, accused the sanctions that the United States had imposed on the lack of progress since.
"without faith in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that our first arms will be suddenly broken down by one side," said Rey in his speech before the U.S. General arrest in New York.
Nancy Flossy calls Bert Quano, and says he doesn't fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The draft leader, Nancy Flossy, called the Supreme Court candidate “Histri” and said that Jobo would not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flossy responded at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribal Festival in Texas.
I couldn't think that if a woman ever showed up, they would have said "Hystrist", Flossy said about her reaction to Quano's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on the day of 'em.
Quano turned down with emotion the claims that attacked Dr. Christine Blysey Ford when both of them were growing up.
During his opening speech, Quano was very emotional, and sometimes almost yelled and yelled when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also spoke of a democrat in the committee and called for arguments against him about the murder of Mafim and Grotsky because of the rage of the Liberians for the fact that Henry Clinton lost the election for presidents in 2016.
Flossy said that Quano’s opinion proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it was a prejudication against the democrats.
"I think he took these statements out of his mind and the way he pursued the Clementes and Democrats," she said.
Flossy failed when we asked whether you would try to distract us if we were to be happy, and if the Democrats were to win most of the House of the elect.
I say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he doesn't fit, not just to vote in the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he's serving right now," said Flossy.
Cowano is currently serving as judge in the Federal Court of the Sorceress of the District of Colombia.
Flossy added that as a democracy, she has concerns about possible discontinuations of Quana against the health records of Abmma or the judgment against Weyd, since he is considered Judge Martin.
At his approval hearing, Quano avoided questions about the possibility of canceling certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
There's no reason for a hysterical man to come to court and expect it to be said, "It's no great," said Flossy.
And women have to use it.
It's a critical review, months and years of anger rising on his back, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we get upset," she told me Mrs. Steinen 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, do I?
She kept saying, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was running somewhere else, who said she was crying too when she was upset, but she developed techniques and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to tell the man she was talking about, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears get out of the way as it goes out of anger, between the others because they are not built by them.
One of my most meaningful memories serving at an early stage in my life, at the office with most of my men, is that I found myself crying once in an inexplicable rage, and an older woman caught my neck, it was a cold manager that I was always afraid of -- and she dragged me into the stairs room.
"Don't let them see you're ever crying," she told me.
They don't know you're feeling angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy because they've been able to make you sad."
Patricia Schrewder, who was a Congress company at the same time from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the election trips for presidents.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for an affair outside of marriage on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race, Schrewer, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of self-governing.
"It wasn't a decision I thought of well," she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was to face another challenge.
Someone called it "Cultiple and Seven. "
Because she joined the election trip at a later stage, she's a fund-raiser, so she swears you won't join the race unless you make $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who contributed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount"? She'll be wondering.
During the speech that you will not be able to open up on an official election trip, the feelings were so expressed that thanks to the people you support, from the system you've put so much emphasis on raising money and focusing on choosing instead of drawings, and anger over the sexual darkness -- she's shed tears.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," she remembered that Rhoder had responded to the press.
You could have thought I got protection from Clinks.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my situation?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S. trade war between China and China can be beneficial to Big King
The opening of the U.S. Trade War in China was an earcrow, and although the fight is far from over, a conflict between nations can be useful for long-term Big Wing, they say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the opening shot earlier this year when he handed a tax on important Chinese and all solar, steel and aluminium products.
The most meaningful settlement occurred this week with new substances that have affected products at $200 billion (150 million L.S.), in cancelling in fact half of the goods brought to the United States in China.
Bigbing responded every time in the same coin, and recently increased the inflations by 5 to 10 percent on American goods of $60 billion.
China has committed to bringing back a blow on every U.S. hit, and it's unlikely that the second economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to return to it as a halt to its requirements, but a public credit to the United States will be too embarrassing for President China, which is G Yinfing.
However, experts say that if Big King managed to run correctly, the tensions from the U.S. Trade War could be positively supported in China in the long term, and narrowed the sidelines between the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision quickly in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of a financial trade in each of the countries is actually much more dangerous than they have seen in India before”, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, on the New American Security Team.
Syria is ready for the return of the refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria says she's ready to return from the will of refugees and call for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed in a long war that has lasted over seven years.
In a speech to the arrest of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Willed said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Since the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress achieved in the war of terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the free return of the refugees to the country that they left because of the single-sided terrorism and economic steps, which we meant to harm their daily lives and their pension.
According to U.S. estimates, over 5.5 million tourists have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Sudan said the secret police would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the police would not get a gifted aid or assistance from countries that had signed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 and destroyed the U.S. team in a final result of 16.5 - 10.5 on the course for her golf satellite outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times to date on Europe's soil and has not won the Ryder Hill in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the captain's team came to 14.5 points that it needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who fought all over the Turner almost sent his shot down T to the water on the 16th floor of February 3, and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari Brick in all his rounds, and became one of the four players who had reached 5-0-0 since the start of the present building, 1979.
American actor Jordan Spey's 5 and 4 by the lower-level player on the European team, the Verbourn Olsen Mannemmark.
Dustin J. Johnson, the trained player in the first place in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Pulter from England, which may be the last time he's gonna play at the Ryder Cup.
With a bag of eight involved in the Ryder Cup, the Spanish version of the Yo Grasia became a European player with the highest number of victorys in the Turins with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold back.
It was a tough year.
So I'm grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help."
He's moving the llipid to the White John Ream who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on the day of I'm done.
"The great pride I feel, defeat Tiger Woods, where I watched when I grew up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Weds lost all four games in France and his president now stands at 13-21-3 when he's the Rider Cup in career.
This is strange statistical data from one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 important frequencies, just before it is found.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend to find its way on the continents, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinao who played a high-level golf for the rest of the tourer.
The captain of the U.S. team spoke after the disappointed performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the American professional golf association and with our Rider Gap Committee and we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take off the hat.
Hobbsno."
