A study published on Thursday in the Sance magazine mentioned the creation of a new type of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Bristton, U.S.A., and the University of Obsala, Sweden reported that the development of new species took only two jellies -- although he believed that this process would take a much longer -- due to the proliferation between the traversing Darwin, medium-sized land, migrant bees and sharp-strips.
Gold can be shaped in various forms.
It can be drawn to a high wire that can be found and discovered.
It could be made too narrow, and it could be so narrow that it was sometimes used to emulate manually written images in books called the "Present Line".
It's called the HPA number of the chemical, and you can make an indicator of this figure using the red cane.
The color of the file is changed depending on the extent to which the chemical is seized or released.
The level of hydrogen is measured by the number of hydrogen ionates (H-liter in pH) in the test chemical.
hydrogen ions are electron-insulated protons (where hydrogen ions consist of one broth and one electrons).

When you contact someone thousands of miles away, you use industrial numbers.
The satellite receives the call space and then reflects it at almost the same moment.
The industrial moon was sent to space by a rocket, using space-based scientists because the Earth's atmosphere is clouded with some light and vision.
It requires an operating rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to place an artificial moon or a waiter in space.
The speed has changed the shape of the world in an amazing way; but the availability of easier and faster transport remains the most important contribution to us.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other transport devices.
There are more medium-sized cats under which they feed on pillars of medium size ranging from rabbits to sheep and geese.
Finally, there are many small cats (including squawking cats) that consume the most numerous small profits such as insects, cods, glaciers and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of position, a special function of each plant that prevents them from competing with others.
Black is the most social cat and lives in large groups called trajectorys.
The black family consists of 1 to 3 adult males, plus up to 30 females and boys.
Women are usually closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and girls.
Black cats work like wolves or dogs, and suddenly animals are similar to the lion (but not the other big cats) in behaviour and are very dead to its prey.

Scientists believe that original cats are tracked and found animals that they eat (farsa) by means of the shimmer; they poison where they were on the ground.
She can see it in the dark through night vision, and move too hard.
When a small group of living organisms (a small number of populations) are separated from the main group of their own population (for example, if they move through a series of mountains or a river, or move to a new island so that they cannot return easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment from their former environment.
In view of the fact that this new environment is contained in different resources and competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become strong competition compared to the previous strength.
There has never been any change in indigenous peoples. They still need the same adjustment as we promised.
Over time, while new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarities with other populations gradually decline.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look different to the extent that we cannot call them the same.
We call this process the emergence of species, which simply means the formation of new species. The creation of species is considered a imperative and a very important part of evolution.
The oxygen plants are produced by human breathing, and the carbon dioxide is preserved by humans (i.e., zebras).
The plants produce their food from the sun through optical representation, as well as the shadow.
We make our homes and clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat from plants as well. Without plants, animals can't stay.
The muzzasus was the dominant inspector of his time, so he didn't approach anything, except for the other mozzas.
It was as long as more than 70 years of age as the scars, as well as another group in its mouth's ceiling, which meant there was no place for anything that stood on its way.
We don't know for certain, but maybe he had a common tongue, including his food system, large fish, and other bananas, and he may have been a meat eater.
She also attacked everything that came into the water; even working dinosaurs like T. Rex did not match it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of the strange or unusual Christmas elements, including the wild pigs, the Taoos, the fact, and a kind of rock called the dove.
Another difference was that while the poor and women were eating their food and sitting on the seats, the rich men loved living together where they slept on their side during their duties.
It could not have included old Roman responses to the meals that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries to come.
For example, they didn't have any corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and neither of the old Roma had any taste.
The Baals of each god of their gods were a major temple, and the house of the LORD was the house of God.
People were approaching the gods, and priests were trying to meet the needs of the gods during the celebrations and holidays.
Every open temple that leads to a safe hole can only enter the priesthood.
At times, unique towers were built in the form of fragments called zebras to be part of the temples.
The tower was a safe haven for God.

If you have seen the national treasure film, you may think that the Kens map has been written on the back of the declaration of independence.
But that's not true, even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a text map.
The opening of the declaration of independence was written with the words “the original declaration of independence on 4 July 1776”. The text appears below the document, closed.
Although the writer of this part of the text is not specifically known, we know that the large column (as measured by 293 % in the range × 241 by weight) was a comprehensive inventory at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the code has been added simply as a designation.
On the next day, the incursions and subsequent battles have led to the liberation of northern France, but the South has not yet been released.
These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the ghetto instead of fighting them.

In just two weeks, the U.S. and the free French forces released south of France, and were on their way to Germany.
Culture is an individual culture shared by a wide range of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The root of a cultural word from Latin civilis, which means a civilian, which is related to Latin, meaning a citizen, and the city or city, i.e., the city or city, which also defines the community mass.
Civil culture implies the transfer of knowledge through several generations, with the remaining cultural impact and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microculturals are often confused without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the RUW, the 13 states first formed a weak central government – the Congress was the only element in which – under the Statute of the Federal Union.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and because of the absence of national or judicial executive authority, it relied on State authorities, which were often uncooperative, to impose all its laws.
Furthermore, it does not have the power to exceed tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles requested the unanimous consent of all States before their amendment and ridicule had been made by the central Government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.

Because of Japan's contracts/group of islands, Japan is often referred to from a geographical perspective as "Arguil"
Taiwan started on the way back in the fifteenth century, where European seas bearing the name of the island are formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Foundation established a base in south-west Taiwan and began to change the production practices of the original grain and the employment of Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, Hemanjesz of the Ching family (1644-1912) over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan declared a province of the Ching Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Japanese war, between 1894 and 1895, the Government of Ching signed the Chimonoski Treaty, through which it withdrew its sovereignty over Taiwan for Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Matsho Bechho consists of three main buildings, namely, Antihutana, the sun's temple and the three windows room.
Most of the buildings on the walls of the complex were rebuilt to give a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 per cent of the Batsho Bethu had been recovered and the restoration work had been resumed to date.
For example, the world's most common flat image coordination is 35 millimetres, which is the size of the film at the end of the forecasting era.
Their production is still ongoing until today, but more importantly, it is that the image encryption body in digital cameras has inherited the degree to which the image is presented.
The 35mm model is in fact, you're a little confused with 36 mm and 24 mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this image would be (as divided to 12 for the most accurate number) so it would be 3:2.
Equal or similar to many common versions (e.g., the outline set of the advanced image system) of the presentation to this rise.
The misused triad rule, which is often made of forced labour, is a simple guiding principle that is conducive to dynamic development while maintaining a certain system in a clear sense.
It is recalled that the most influential place on the main theme is when the lines that divide the picture into three columns and horizontally (see, for example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was subject to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Despite differences in language and customs, the Christian religion has linked the European States to more than a thousand years.
The overall power that you possess has affected everyone from the king to the years of the people.
Among the key Christian principles, wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's cash is in particular for this reason.
The central authority of the Church in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this focus on power and money has led many to question the extent to which the requirements of the creed are met.
The British quickly took over Germany's siege by sea after the Nazis began.
The strategy has proved its effectiveness; military and civilian vital supplies have been cut, despite the generally accepted violation of international law, which has been elaborated and coordinated in several international conventions during the past two centuries.
Britain has abolished international waters to prevent any ship from entering full sectors of the oceans, threatening even neutral ships.
In view of the limited response to the tactics, Germany expected a similar response to the war of its unrestricted woundeds.
During the decades of the last century, the attitudes prevailing among most citizens and nations were peace and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the first world war, States wanted to avoid that position again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of hair, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (Director in his previous post) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different time periods; each phase of China or family in power was of a different kind.
In addition, there has been an unstable time of divided districts between each court of justice. The months of these periods have been the three 60-year-old domain of ownership between Han and Jean's family.
During these periods, a terrible war arose between many of the Babylonians in pursuit of the throne.
The three owner's gate is one of the most bloody in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died during the fighting to sit at the top of the palace in Chian.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the system, the transition from exclusion to the Republican system, nationality, and the belief that the country has a ownership of the people and not of the Governor alone.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male advancements, allowing the most ambitious and successful.
The same applies to the army because, instead of being based on the army ' s classifications, it is now dependent on the flag.
The French revolution has also inspired many other school-based workers in other countries to destroy their heritages.
Mohamed was very interested in things that went beyond this secular life.
The same giant, who has remained for ages, presents a very living picture of the prophet Mewell Muhammad spiritual.
The cave lies at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Makma, which is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find him at all, even if you knew he was there.
Nothing can be seen from the unspoiled net sky above the many surrounding mountains. It can be seen or heard very little of this world inside the cave.
The biggest riddance in the governorate is the only one of the seven wonders that remain to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the present century, which is considered one of the great horrors based on the honour of the dead branches.
The Al-Jessa tree, or the Al-Jessa City of Al-Jazza, contains a number of objects (the largest one) and small graves, houses and father of Haul.
The greatest scandal of honoring the Branches was created for fear, and many widows, graveyards and smaller mosques were built to honor the wives of their fear and family members.

On 6 October 1789, King Luis XVI and Queen Mary Antonio and their 11-year-old little children (the 11-year-old Mary Terezahs and Luis Charles Charles) were forced to return to Paris by the mobilization of a market-based woman.
They traveled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a large crowd of people screaming and screaming against the King and the Queen.
A group of people were able to force the king and the queen to open the windows of their car on her shipmen.
One of the gang members, at one time, threw the head of one of the Royal Guards in Farsai in front of the so-called Queen.
The people of the Philippines suffered the expenses of the United States of America's Umbria war in their invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and benefits on bonds placed on behalf of the Government of the Philippines via the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the surplus profits derived from the lengthy exploitation of the Philippines will constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context of the establishment of the organization, so that we can resuscitate the parts of the temple.
The era in which those events took place was known as the highest central age, the period from European history in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (13,000-1300 after birth).
The highest peaks were observed in the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended in about 1500.
The technological imperative is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice, from moving technology or technological necessity to a firm sense that the destiny of a human being is driven by a basic logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas involved in most technological imperative interpretations: the development of technology itself follows a way that goes far beyond exaggeration or scientific, and that in turn, it has “effects” on complex societies, rather than society-related.
For example, one might say that car engine necessarily leads to road development.
However, the establishment of a country-wide road network is not economically beneficial for a bunch of cars, so new ways are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to a high rate of road accidents, leading to the innovation of new health-care techniques to treat affected objects.
Romania had a large component of cultural imperative derived from a book such as his death and death.
In the context of the Roma movement, individuals have been made up of geographical individuals, and, over time, customs and culture related to those geographicals have emerged, which, as in harmony with the place of society, have been better than arbitraryly imposed laws.
As the capital of the modern world, Paris was also the capital of Constantine, which was considered to be the capital of sectoral Europe.
She was born in 400 years and continued until 1100 after birth.
Its situation during the twelfth century was identified primarily because of the fact that Cassis campaigns had returned and with them had gifts, such as silk and fibre, which were of higher value than those offered by the Belizen markets.
At this time, the capital of Paris was shot in lieu of Constantine.
The quota peaked between the tenth or eleventh centuries to the fourteenth century.
At first, in the east, Pissinian culture has had a profound impact on clothing.
Nevertheless, given the slowness of the channels of communication, patterns in the West may be delayed to some 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own method. One of the greatest developments at that time as a result of the civil war began to use the roots to link clothing.
The subsistence cultivation is the farming that is undertaken to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and his family.
Famine cultivation -- which is often organic -- is a simple system using stored seeds that are appropriate to the environmental system of the region, as well as a relatively simple crop rotation or other techniques with a view to increasing output.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence farming, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subdivisions test the thinking of individuals who are ignored by community standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultural cultures are likely to be characterized by age, race, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subcultural culture may be linguistic, collective, religious, political, nationality, geographical or group of factors.
Subcultural members refer to their membership through a different and symbolic use of the style of clothing, cost and repair.
Among the most common ways that are used to clarify the importance of social creation, the reliance on the few unfortunate situations of children who have suffered, through neglect, ill-treatment or deliberate abuse, is not socially linked to adults during their upbringing.
Some children were imprisoned by (their parents ’ usual); in some cases, the child was disfellowshipped due to the parents ' refusal to interfere with the mental or physical disability of a child.
The children may be subjected to ill-treatment during childhood or severe trauma before they leave or escape.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, the brutal child shows behaviors (within physical boundaries) that are completely similar to the behavior of the private animal, such as fear of or lack of self-esteem.
While project-based learning must make learning easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a way to learn, but rather a means of helping to provide support to individuals who are experiencing a new educational experience such as the use of a new computer programme or the start of a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtually and on the ground, and in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as a man who is involved in the paper in Micronesia Ovis.
Interactive learning is supported in the programme internally and aims at asking questions, stimulating and explaining the procedures that may be difficult for a student to deal with alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on upbringing, care and education, but does so.
We recognize that the alternative care system is a safe area for these children.
Our system of adoption is supposed to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Alternative care must provide all the needs that they have met in the homes they had left earlier.
The Internet combines both elements of public and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use approaches and networking methods.
For example, some suggest “learning” and “socialization” as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal participation” and “continuous relations” were identified as new catalytic aspects by Amy and Courd (1998) when they studied public response on web sites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of accurate facial expressions, which are continuous to a few parts of the second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can find out whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of expressions.
In his paper, Oliver Sachs noted that the presidential speech indicates that people who are unable to understand the word because of brain damage are able to accurately evaluate the finger.
It even offers the idea that these capacities will be in the analysis of human behaviour common to some animals, such as dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that two groups of ethnic diversity: one cluster and another phenomenon.
The abundance adds new genetic differences and removes them from the collection of expression differences.
The separation and reconfiguration processes are making the difference randomly and positively between the two groups with each generation.
In Savana, it is difficult for the mains to have a human-like human-substantiated system to meet their requirements for mono-missile acid from available plant resources.
Failure to do so would have disastrous consequences: underdevelopment, undernourishment, and eventually death.
Most easily accessible plant resources were paper and paper proteins, but they were difficult to combine with the majors, such as us.
On the contrary, animal food (salms, white and white ants) is not only easy to feed, but also provides high-cost protein proteins containing all essential monomer acids.
When all things are taken into account, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solve their “proton problem” in a way that is the same as the Chambanzi in Savannah.
The interruption of sleep is the deliberate wake-up during the period of your natural sleep and sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet oven to bring you back to your senses without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself taking the watch back during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up from bed to stop it.
Other options, based on biosystems, include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a known beta-arter) before sleeping, which obliges a person to promote acceptance.
The amount of internal peace a person has is counterproductively linked to the amount of tension in his or her body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive it gives it, the more positive it gives it.
The only thing that hinders us on the way to this goal is our tension and our integrity.

Germany has been a common enemy in the Second World War, which has led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but, at the end of the war, the confrontation of regimes, procedures and cultures has led to the outbreak of conflict between the two States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the cold war has begun.
This war was supposed to continue for the next 40 years, and fighting on the ground, through the Agency's armies, would have been in the areas of fighting from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 July 1939, the Polish defence had already been defeated, and the only hope was to reorganize and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans have become old among the estuarys, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish Soviet Non-Affliction Convention and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most effective way of transporting large quantities of persons and goods across the oceans.
The tradition has been that the function of maritime forces is to ensure your country ' s ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time, to oppose the ability of your enemy to transport its people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of observation is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War, where Americans have tried to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German sea was trying to address this invasion with its strength in the use of boats.
If the allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to expropriate Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.

Car routes were established in England at a time of the sixteenth century.
Although the old railway vehicles were only made up of parallel wooden panels, they allowed horses to withdraw them to achieve higher speeds and to withdraw larger loads as compared to the roads that were considered to be more frequent at that time.
The train officers were invented relatively early to establish the tracks, but it was then seen that the development of a high-road iron tape would make it more effective.
This has become a track record, but iron has led to further erosion of vehicle wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels; in 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
The walking was the first means of transportation. People have been infected for two million years, in conjunction with the appearance of the homo Eriktos.

This is just like treating symptoms in many cases, yet, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems, and we must end them.
It is sufficiently clear that the world has changed considerably because of the scientific and technical progress of humanity, and problems have become greater as a result of the increase in population and the pattern of human well-known life.
After being adopted by Congress on 4 July, a draft was sent in handline signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson behind some of the buildings to John Dunlab.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies have been put into operation, now known as the "Danlab Banknotes".
It was the first public reading of the document by John Nixon at the hall of independence on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and I read it on his forces in New York on 9 July, and a copy of it reached London in the tenth of August.
The twenty-fifth Danalap exercises represent the oldest remaining copies of the American declaration of independence document, but the original copy in hand is not written for survival.
Many secret scientists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today, and we call it birds.

Biological hours are self-inflicted and will continue for periods of follow-up even if there are no external substances.
Herschry and Chis experience was one of the main signs that DNA is genetic.
Hirschi and Chis used the furniture or viruses to bring their DNA into the body.
They have tested the name of either the DNA using a radio-fossor or its protein with a radioactive sulphur.
The babies may have a variety of effects, depending on the size, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from the anthrax cells.
It can only be transferred to the children of the rattome line cells, while other places can cause the death of the cells or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wild and animal life.
Examples of activities that could be undertaken at the site of fishing, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of information on the environmental system are examples.
An example of this is a visit, a photo and a knowledge of this larvae of the larvae, oragatuangs, in Brunio.

In this animal transport mode, each supports and is somewhat linked to the system of transport of its own vehicles.
Science now indicates that this huge carbon-dependent economy has shaken the living ocean from one of its stable situations that have supported human development over the past million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses communications systems. Everyone complains about communications systems.
Similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or bridges that fall are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transport regulations generate such complaints, and why fail daily? Is the transport engineer inadequate? Or is there something more fundamental that happens?
The traffic is to study the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, driving is difficult because driver behaviour can't be expected to be 100 percent sure.
Unfortunately, drivers tend to operate within a reasonable range of consistency; this is why traffic has a reasonable consistency and can be closely expressed as sports.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, relations have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow (2) intensity and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road facilities.
The insects were the first to fly in the air, helping them to fly away more easily from enemies and to find food and couples more efficiently.

People have known the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since old ages, where all of these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively easy way using alternative tools.
The philosopher assumed that everything consisted of a combination of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
This was similar to the four cases of the article (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also assumed that it would turn into new materials to form what we see.
Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic schedule.
And there are, of course, metals like silver and gold, as well.
You can also get your pants containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.

Theories of content are based on the creation or appeal of people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that appear self-expressed when they reach the stage of achievement.
These theories examine what makes some people want the things they do and things in their environment that make them do or do certain things.
Two common contentories are the meslo hierarchical series of needs and the second working theory of Hezborg.

Data relating to nerve science provide concrete evidence of the theoretical approach in the investigation of knowledge, thus reducing the research area and making it much more accurate.
Supports the interdependence between brain disease and the conduct of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, pests, or urination affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new techniques allows us to see and explore structures and brain processes in a way that we have not done before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build models of comparisons that will help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is a powerful symbol of scientific imagination, it is a very important component of computer science and deals with behaviour, learning and mental adjustment in the machine.
Research into artificial intelligence includes the manufacture of machines to perform functions that require smart behaviour.
Examples include control, planning, schedules and the ability to respond to client diagnosis and questions, as well as identification of the line of the hand, voice and face.
Such things have become separate areas that focus on providing solutions to real life's problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now used in the fields of the economy, medicine, engineering and the army and has been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered to be a large part of any school class, often the teacher may like to take her students to places where going by bus is not considered an exception.
The technology provides a solution through virtual field visits. Students can watch archaeological objects in the museum, visit the fish shop, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting in their class.
Participation in a prospective field trip is also an excellent way to restore a particular trip and exchange experiences with future chapters.
For example, students from the City of North Carolina school each year design an electronic site about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but old publications are kept online as a record.
Codes can also help to improve student writing, while students often begin their experience in codes with unconvinced rules, the existence of a general audience changes.
Since students are often the most critical, the author of the Code is seeking to improve writing in order to avoid criticism.
Codes “encourage students to become smarter around the world.” The need to feed public attention is inspired by students to be good and useful (Toto, 2004).
Codification is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of codes can " make students more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to the material on the Internet, students can determine their positions in the context of other writings as well as their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
