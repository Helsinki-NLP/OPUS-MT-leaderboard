At times, in the land of their growling, they will hear of the rising of the waters, and of the breaking of the bridges.
Why do traffic systems bring such complaints, and why are they not successful every day? Are transport engineers inadequate? Or is something more fundamental being done?
The flow of traffic between two points is the activity of motorists, motor vehicles, and the study of the relationship between one another.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict the nature of a driver as if it were not fought.

In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) security, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to prepare, balance, and perform street services.
