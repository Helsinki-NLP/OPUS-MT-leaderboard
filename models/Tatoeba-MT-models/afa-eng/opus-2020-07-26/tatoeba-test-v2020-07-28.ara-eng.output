Details are not important.
Last night it was cold.
Her hair squeezing makes her look younger than her age.
I wonder how Tom feels like Mary.
Sammy wanted to focus on his study.
Is he a teacher?
From the point of my personal experience, I came to believe that the partnership between America and Islam must be based on the fact of Islam, not on what is non-Muslim, and I see in that part of my responsibility as President of the United States so that I can address negative stereotypes about Islam wherever it appears.
They had to expect it.
- Is that a bad thing? - A big deal.
We'll just follow you.

Well, you haven't accepted to help Tom in need.
You want another cup of tea?
Sammy was considered missing.
I can't hear you guys.
Were you at school at that time?
The right said, "Nobs, if you kill you, Dima, 25 people must have been Nobs."
She doesn't like Sushi.
It's dead.
I have to go to sleep.
What did Tom do?
Everything Tom really needed was something to eat.
Tom's undercover.
Don't tell me you're jealous because nobody's gonna believe that.
Tom's injuries seem serious.
Where are you going to be on Monday?

We just have to explain why.
Unfortunately, I was busy yesterday and I couldn't do that.
Hey, easy for you at Yayan.
You think so?
I've heard Lily Sammy and he's good.
What happened at the club?

Welcome home.
Can you lower the sound of the TV?
As calm as it is in the room, only the voice of complaint can be heard for an hour.
There are at least 30 students in our class.
What do you want to drink?
But I don't want to.
Wait, Sammy, until Lily's back.
Sammy could even make a friendship with a rock.
Sammy's gone to sleep about the tenth hour.
I don't know exactly when I'm coming back.
That's great!
We got friends right away.
I'll get some coffee.
This was the last picture taken by Sammy.
Let's take a picture as a memorial.
She wore her coat and then came out.

I'm his friend, and I'll stay.
Do you see what I mean?
You have to help him, and quickly.
Please know me on Tom.
Do you like it or not?
You look stupid.
I met Sammy's friends.
I need a cold character.
He did something he promised to do.
The separationists are trying to develop a false narrative in order to justify their political project.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.

My teacher always loved me.
How many times do I have to repeat that?
It's too dangerous for you to be here.
