Wales Council (AM) is concerned about "looking like a doll"
There is concern among some AM over the proposal of their title should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
It came as a result of plans to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that it can be annoyed.
An AM from the Labour Party said his party cared about ‘it's rhyme with ‘Twp' and 'Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘unclean.'
AM from Plaid said his party as a whole was "unhappy" and had suggested an alternative.
A Wales Conservative said his party was ‘open-minded' about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral leap from MWP to Puppet.
In this context, the letter ‘w’ in Wales is referred to the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation for the letter ‘u.’
The Commission of the Council, which is drafting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any presenter called a Member of the Council must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission informed the results of public talks on proposals that received broad support to call the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to AM titles, the Commission favored the members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AM seems to be proposing alternative options, but it is problematic to reach an agreement and could silence the head of Honorary Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes in a matter of weeks.
Laws on renewal include other changes in the way the council works, including rules on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of committee systems.
AM will have a final vote on what to say when they discuss the law.
Macedonia votes in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the 'North Republic of Macedonia.'
Popular votes were set up in an effort to resolve decades of dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor represents demands on its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership offer for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was only the price to pay to join the EU and NATO unions.
St. Martin's Bell Silent as Churches Are Struggling in Harlem
"The parents I met say, historically, there are bars and churches on every side of the road," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, they're both gone."
He said the loss of a bar is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways nowadays," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last long as leaders expect it, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sanctuary that remains in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in this building are white people," he said, "and will therefore make these churches completely shut down because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condominiums will be members of the churches."
The two churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black community that had been worshipping nearby had taken possession of the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by blacks under the Honored John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at 125th Street, a major street to shop in Harlem, which was opposed to taking or promoting blacks in employment.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bells.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Priest Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as the ‘poor bell of the poor.’
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural treasures’ and ‘historical instruments that cannot be replaced.’
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St Martin over the past few months has become a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestri space - the church's administrative body, composed of civil leaders - wrote in July with concern the bishop "would seek to approve the cost" for the vestri space, even though the vestri space was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the church complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's section.
Sharks injuring 13-year-old boy while diving in search of reef shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in search of a reef shrimp in California on the opening day of the reef shrimp season, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch the shrimp, but he "noticed that the boy was screaming, "I've got to bite!
I've got to bite!"
His entire collarbone was torn and opened," Hammel said when he noticed the boy.
"I yelled to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that the species of sharks were harmless.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the top of his body.
Officials shut down coastal access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty-style room in a convenience building run by an expert assistant.
As part of a hard drive into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow while fashion sales and home appliances are returning, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and brought to more buildings next year if it succeeds.
Investments in beauty emerged when supermarkets were looking for ways to use shelf spaces that were previously claimed for TV, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket has also relaunched a variety of Boutique makeup products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly demanding by buyers from young people.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury supermarkets, the first opening in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards buying a little bit of food every day in a local convenience store means the supermarket needs to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, said the branch would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain tried to fight the big business of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has placed Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since it bought the two chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made earnings more profitable.
The supermarket had previously wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boot in the early 2000s, but it ended after a fight on how to divide income from pharmaceutical stores in its market.
A new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Lloyds, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the show, adding a variety of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the look and appearance in our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with specially trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our wide range of brands are designed to meet every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location means that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'great' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11m bid
Peter Jones, Den's Dragons star, 'brown' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for home goods and accessories from the True Brand.
The couple's business is likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that he would quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Den's Dragons star, Peter Jones, in a rage by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business in the final moments - to focus on her new extraordinary contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was ‘broken’ when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote home goods and accessories from the True brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truely, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
Sources said: "Until now, Holly has been a priority.
It will be his long-term future that can see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that's ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most acceptable stars, could harm millions of firms due to massive investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and household items, and potentially delaying its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40<0x25> stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We're not going to comment on his business."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making reviews that would partially consider "unnatural to the president" and were very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in the wake of a “news reader.”
“I never give up losing.”
He said Kim was interested in his second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was crowned by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But the negotiations for the ceasefire of the nuclear program have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "a similar answer" from the United States about North Korea's initial gunfire movement.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rallying speech.
"Our relationship is good with North Korea," he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing the remains of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastate islands, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition to catalyze international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly did not ask for international help, so it was a bit of a challenge," Mrs. Subuk said.
While Save the Children together in a team going to Palu, it's uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the scene.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquake that Indonesia is often facing, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal areas.
The shortage of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings have taken effect, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for victims of the quake was heading for Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made severe infrastructure improvements a key point in his election campaign, and he has given high allocation to roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi is facing pressure from school tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have received a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri when it was about 30 miles away from Chelsea's goal with his side ahead of 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt soared high above the goal goal as it hovered towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I'm trying to slow down as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a kick and don't think long and make a shot."
Chelsea went ahead 1-0 in the half-time after getting the net in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before hovering in the middle of the pitch and running into central Liverpool.
Kovacic giving and sending can be quickly in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal goal.
The danger of passing the defence and scoring away with a left foot kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the wreckage of a building that collapsed in a 7.5-magnitude quake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's agency spokesman told a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with fragments from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation was carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with the 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera futej to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who found her body was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said the investigation was underway, they were in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He'd become a slut when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime site.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He kept repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers were standing inside the cordon monitoring the apartment block of the rental.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 quotation log 247 from 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament commemorates the latest hit 're-writing history'
His removal would be a poetic justice for destruction like his Taliban with so many of England's artifacts and religion cultures carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figures outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for Thomas's ancestral actions in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwella is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of many people believe it is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in the situation of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped our country's next development, and Cromwell is an individual who is known as a figure representing a divided part.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig kills Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a disconnected artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig breeder prepared to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005, in <0x58>ining Province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead and found a pig door open.
He said in a pig cage was a large male pig with his mouth bleeding.
Forensic examinations confirmed that a 550-pound pig had stabbed farmers to death, according to the report.
Wu's "family," said, as quoted by Guiyang's Evening News.
Safety camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40am Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Night News that pigs had been locked to prevent him from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly making compensation talks for his death.
Although rare, the case of pigs attacking humans has been recorded before.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not always aggressive but that blood taste could act as "a trigger."
They're just kidding.
They're nippers, so curious... they don't come out to hurt you.
You just have to pay with the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa overloads extensive rainfall to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves into the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in northern Mexico and southwestern the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 Storm to 5 a.m. East Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward towards the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to resist the tropics north-southwest of the U.S..
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacts with the approaching trough that creates heavy rainfall in the Southwest the next day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, streams of debris and landfall likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern part, especially more than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in severe condition due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to splurge into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to flood rivers and thunderstorms that will bring to the country strong winds and dust blowing.
The nearest trough will bring heavy rain on the coast of Southern California.
The amount of rain more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to small streams of debris and slippery streets.
It was the first rain in the region in the dry season.
Several tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona by Sunday and early Monday, before the rain gets further by Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October it could see some fierce temperature changes crossing the U.S. when the Arctic became cooler, but the tropics remained slightly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short distance temperatures.
There is a great example of temperature differences through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer warmth will continue to try to build and grow again.
Most of the U.S. centre and east are expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeastern part.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touch: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain Kavanaugh was groping him and trying to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said 100 per cent definitely didn't happen.
It may be more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put in perspective, it is the size of the audience equal to the football game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks the host has supported Kavanaugh's appointment, heads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in the drama this Friday.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning screaming by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to the hearings of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with a handicapped eye for a few minutes as he preached, airing live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," a woman said.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when a lot of women don't have power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closes, he would have said a lot at the committee's hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasts all covered hours live later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will see charges against the nominee next week, a minority democrat pressing.
Flake is confident part of a conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation between Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice does have power, as it is clear that Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the newspaper's front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attacks said to be Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU reserves should accumulate tariffs of each "totally unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson with LSU player death
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on charges of killing two degrees, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted Wayde had physically shot dead.
The bond has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Defender reports.
East Coroner Officer Baton Rouge East issued an early report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department credits a team of Louisiana State Police chase officers, a state police crime laboratory, the Southern University Police and the people of the area in assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "consciousness and justice efforts".
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "terrible" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoes explode in Mexico City
Dust spews from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern regions of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and it registered 183 24-hour gas and dust emissions.
The center monitors a variety of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of car windshield covered in a layer of ash in residential areas in Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Political clashes with Catalan followers ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters collided with riot police, and thousands joined the demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the separation of Catalonia's polarization election.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police hurled them with eggs and released paint powder, creating a dark cloud on the streets that tourists used to visit.
The fight also occurred later with the police using their sticks to fight.
Hours later the pro-independence group chanted "No Forget, no forgiveness" face-to-face with the unionist protesters shouting, "Spanish life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protest, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region of independence a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but was welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for their independence, although the percentage of votes out was low with those who opposed the separation largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections at electoral stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the country's police.
The protests took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
I saw my parents crying happily to be able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
While management is crucial if it comes to victory in the regional elections in December, the Catalan pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with its crowded leaders either in exile or in detention to await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before his trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Winning as a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn the regression in the values of democracy and oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man detained after being hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossroads may also have opened fire on the car at some point.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard over to a second defeat in 18 matches as manager of Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face head of Hearts, which they will track with eight points on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the losing run in this section to six matches, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to fight against the opposition.
Holt's team were supposed to be far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort past the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after slipping into Craig Halkett's lead.
The hosts are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can cause trouble to the opposing side with a set cut.
And that’s how important goals are.
Rangers admitted a free kick and Livingston opened the curtains, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took a touch and a goal network from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered possession but had found a home defense that could not penetrate goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely inconsequential.
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scoring from another Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into the Livingston box and continued cleaning, while two penalty claims - after the challenge of replacement Halkett Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - bounced away.
'The phenomenon' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent achievements and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
The style of the game and their staff have barely changed since returning to the top level, but big credits have been forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett is very brave, realizing a great defense that is organized, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
Rangers are not inspirational.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall away from that standard.
The last ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut off the host team - and it was a call for the wake-up Rangers, who found themselves at the mid-table.
Erdogan has received a variety of awards in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, the freedom of the press and Turkey's involvement in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish residential home outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — most of them Kurds — also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war protests depicted the happiness of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicycle rider dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a run-off collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and bus turns in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured in harassment in high-security men's prisons, the Prison Office said.
The disruption occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" expert was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight occupants and had one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been assigned to deal with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June he reportedly received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Lightning Floods (Drought Area Benefits)
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind energy track crosses the Southwest Desert, the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flooding hours for Monday and Tuesday for western and eastern Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical cyclones remain a storm or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert include the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote number so it may be 4 inches.
For them from the risk of flash flooding, Rosa rain may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some whose rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences the worst drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, with a strong Sunday morning hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm faced cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generated a drop.
Therefore, it is expected to collapse in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be heavy, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of rain of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, so it's probably 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main dangers expected from Rosa or debris are extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and streams of debris in the desert, and land collapses in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four attempted assassination arrests
Three young men and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officers appeal to those who may have a cell phone recording of what is going on to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"The Kavanaugh Judge's vote is a vote to reject the cruel and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered very badly, angryly" the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, decisively and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted during the decade during her teenage years.
Ford also testified to the hearing of his allegations.
The TP president said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawmaker with outstanding records in public service," he told the public supporting West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when discussing the importance of Republican elections in general elections.
"Five more weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place that fights for great candidates."
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and stop."
The first major procedure vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's naming is expected to take place no later than Friday, the GOP's senior assistant leadership has informed CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with toll figures rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that crashed on the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration at the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot)-high wave crashed on land at dusk, sweeping many deaths and destroying anything that was on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and did not run and eventually became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster arrest agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it attacked all on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before a strike on the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centers in Paluu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridge turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final concussion continued to shake the city off the coast on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "expanding" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho said casualties and destruction may be more devastating along a coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It is close to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications were completely disconnected without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy but it can be even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the tsunami occurred during the warning period.
In a video on social media, a man's voice was heard screaming at people on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave stormed the coast and pulled together buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami resulted in massive power leaks that cut communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid with cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced population still needs food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's very bad.
As the World Vision Staff of Donggala survived to the town of Palu, they went through the scene of the disaster. Workers took refuge under a tarpal cloth erected in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Although aid teams began providing disaster relief in a dismal setting, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply of material needs and delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster zone is declared a disaster zone of the country.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can only receive help from abroad but for now there is no status."
As the second night approaches Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing victims hope that their loved ones will be a miracle that emerges and cheers them from feeling sad.
On Saturday, a boy was found in a barn.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued the victims of a woman trapped under a stone wreck for two days with the body of her mother next door.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach, has trained two people who were missing from the quake for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recounted how he was passionate about sending WhatsApp messages to skaters in Palu who joined the beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the skater communities.
The message sent has only one grey ray mark compared to two rays of blue.
"I don't think the message has arrived," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 while recharging ATMs in Newport on the Levee
The thief stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink workers who filled money at the Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink worker vacated the ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's worker was busy doing his job, a man ‘runned towards his back' and stole a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed her name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed her name - to Ye.
Announcing his change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was dubbed Ye for a while and she used the nickname as the title of her eighth album published in June.
The change took place during his appearance on Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
“He replaced the singer Ariana Grande who canceled her appearance in the plan on ‘emotional issues,’” the plan’s creator said.
Kanye West said the name has religious significance and is also an abbreviation for its current professional name.
“I believe ‘yes’ is a common word often found in the Gospels and it means ‘you,’” Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of her album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you too. I'm us too. We're us.
It switches from Kanye which means only one, to Ye - a reflection of our pros, vices and confusion and everything.
The album is more than a reflection of our own image."
He was one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former partner, JAY-Z, can also accept it without or with a cross-section and large letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military action against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO pledged at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the army to curb Mexicans."
The military opened fire on civilians at the square on October 2, 1968, which killed 300 civilians as left-wing student movements began to take place across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support young Mexicans by subsidizing monthly to those who are studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to engage in crime gangs.
U.S. should double artificial intelligence funds
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China is becoming increasingly active in the field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the U.S. government made an announcement of artificial intelligence despite the U.S.'s overall lack of an official strategy of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year with the aim to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Regarding the provisions of the study of artificial intelligence is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling the funds could increase the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's most famous companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that had defeated American Othello players who were in the best position while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so that he could identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes on academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued a Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions. It equates the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds to US researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at gathering partners from industry and academies. The White House announced the ranks of the Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. bill attempting to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented in recent months.
The Macedonians voted to change the country's name
The Macedonian people made a referendum on Sunday to determine the change of name to the ‘North Macedonian Republic’. An act that would resolve a dispute with Greece that had lasted for a decade in which Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory named Macedonia, asserts that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents demands on its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonia’s participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name-change in June but nationalist opposition said the conversion degraded the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians whose population was Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the startup raised doubts as to whether the referendum would reach a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper reads: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with receipt of agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said: "Receiving the new name is a well-paid price to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally valid, parliamentarians said they would comply with the voting decision to make it final.
The change of name requires two-thirds of the majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of non-compliance with the rules until 1 p.m.
However, the voting presence was 16 percent versus 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections after 66 percent of registered voters threw the ballot paper.
"I came to vote because of my children. Our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko removed the vote paper in Macedonia for the country's name change that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with a sense of pride instead of this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said participation in NATO would provide adequate investment to Macedonia where its unemployment rate exceeded 20 per cent.
"I believe the vast majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population votes for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the ‘yes’ decision was a ‘confirmation of our future.’
A vote was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies saying between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the polls - below the required amount.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum, the number of voters coming must be 50<0x25> plus one vote.
Failure in the referendum will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigated through Brighton's entire line-up of defense to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton's defence at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced between Brighton's three defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green-clothed players.
He rejected a defender before chasing a few more men at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he refused to send to the left, looking for Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball in the Brighton area in the match.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took some touch before leading Sterling towards a distant position.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the network before sliding out of the limits.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group played at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the game's clashes, there is no reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face a stronghold on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are run-out implications for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special opportunity spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first-part champions.
"Although we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams will play probably at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I fight in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce novices for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a draw in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, holds a body-heating session on Thursday and will make a throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed propeller from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 hits precisely in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
The president by not directly referring to the situation surrounding the High Court voted for Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not competing but I'm very competitive and that's why I'm in all places fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible radical Democrat, you see it's happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back by any means, you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they are hurting, who they need to break to get power and kawala. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and stop.’
"And you saw that for the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats 'em angry, evil and untrue."
He referred to the position of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Are you leaking the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's the worst body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Workers are no longer a large church.
It's not tolerant for anyone who expresses their views.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I was the latest in the AP Labour line was told that we weren't welcome - all because of the voice of our views.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment as he supported anti-Jewish people.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically the issue is almost the same as what Jeremy did not agree with the previous leader.
The meeting notice for the Nottingham East Labour party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that encompasses all and is productive."
For nearly eight years as a local Labor AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really encompasses all of that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises of ‘better, softer' have long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour party and each opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a previous colleague, I think sharing almost the same political outlook began expecting me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - either on national security or EU single markets.
When I talk outside - and no matter what I say - it will be followed by criticism for abuse on social media, being told not to vote, denouncing the political center, telling me to get out of the Labour party.
And that’s not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than my co-workers because of comments on me more about politics.
I'm impressed by the professional attitude and persistence of my colleagues who are flooded with sexist and racist oaths every day but never give up.
One aspect of the political disillusionment of this era is how the level of abuse has become accustomed to.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church and with every ‘distrust' proposal or change in election rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years urging me to remain silent, not to be too prominent and then I’m going to ‘be good.’
But that’s not my intention to enter politics.
Since I was a 32-year-old Labour student, raised by the neglect of Thatcher's government that allowed my entire class to be destroyed, I've been trying to lead a better public service for those in desperate need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East may be confused about my position and the division of discrepancies with the current leadership.
To those who backed the proposal on Friday, what I wanted to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will push our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise un-elected threats or political fitness doesn't stop me from acting in what I believe is in the interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmatched Ayr climbing to the summit
Two slow attempts may make a final decision, but no doubt Ayr deserves success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now in the top spot on the table, the only one that has never lost out of 10 people.
Eventually, their superior defence, as much as they took the opportunity, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We have been tested on our game so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson conducted the trial in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the network and Jason Baggot catch a non-conversion attempt.
Climo preceded Ayr with a penalty, before, at half-time, he got a point then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was brought out, and from the start, Ayr went straight ahead again through Stafford McDowall's trial, a conversion by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose countered additional players with Bruce Colvine's non-conversion attempt, at the end of a fierce pressure period.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for Climo's ballless tackle, from the outer line of the penalty, MacPherson hit behind the forward Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did nearly as a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away Gregor Henry's flanker for the home team's fifth try.
Star Still Game is seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran's Still Game star was seen ready to move to the hospitality industry after he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, where he wrote and starred alongside old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the ninth series will be the last on the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to the official record report, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources gave the shadow that Kiernan wanted to engage in a ‘developed restaurant business.'
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marine guards at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public building lifts the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon is scalded with the motto: 'The ocean is ours in fact.
Getting back is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal loss to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century remains clear - like a yearning to navigate the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is probably the highest of the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course hope for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's results on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will favor the Bolivian demands - after centuries of talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial match for next year's re-election - was also of much interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if it happens a little it will change very much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to grant the area to Chile, and has determined that it will not determine the decision for the possibility of discussions.
Regarding the ICJ's decision to come out just after six months of final arguments were heard suggesting the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chile's international law expert.
And it’s not to slow down Bolivia’s basics anymore, for these four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of entry into the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little mercy, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold discussions later on.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia a "great opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "finish a 139-year dispute for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's famous presidents - was using maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to get a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not carry out their nuclear weapons if he did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to carry out promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart a cease-fire nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “just a dream” that continued U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang making a pistol.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is as serious as launching weapons that are seen as the only way to ensure the security of its country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest designs of a large head decoration on its way to the main road near you.
If you want to add your hat collection or completely block the sunlight, then there is no need to look far.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a variety of large-sized weird headpieces for their SS19 collection on stage that charmed the Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has swept through Instagram this summer and this designer has sent out their charming designs to the stage of the show.
The outstanding design by Valentino is a great water-colored yellow hat decorated with thick imitation feathers that wide cover the model’s head.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-decorated melons, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head hot.
Thom Browne also reveals an odd choice of masks - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been sewn his lips and more resemble Hannibal Lecter than the graceful outfit.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkel and gogal, while the other looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the big fashion reality - you're lucky.
Style observers predict that a very large bonet may be heading to the main road near you.
The large, medium-sized hat of 'La Bomba', a full two-foot straw hat has been seen to be worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king's label behind the very impractical hat has been posted on social media to send another big design to the stage - a straw beach bag is almost as big as the model covers the shower he wears.
An orange-burned rafia bag, decorated with a rifle edge and coupled with a white holder, which stands out in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the coming summer - because the designer has made a very big impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding examination results, strengthened by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Board of Scottish Private Schools (SCIS), strives to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector that they can and implement earlier school curriculum, we see modern language continues to be well-known and the subject of choice is desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, it's going to get into your head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will come into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is the top subject in the league schedule with the highest graduation rate in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who study a foreign language receive a higher grade A.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, shows 72 percent of students get a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learn German, 69 percent of them learn French and 63 percent learn Spanish as well.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject of choice, are being held the same way as subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers struggled to meet vacancies, 17 percent were linked to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, over and over again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring language, these skills are very important in this globalized world.
Regardless of one's career choice, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who has mastered many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent cannot speak a foreign language well enough for conversations, with French as the language of conversations spoken only by two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for children today.
Having multiple languages, especially developing countries, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that are seen to be very important for the UK when looking forward in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages to choose from within a private-like school, with an instructor who specializes in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and supply them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as ‘international communication skills.’
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's good to be fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron will make his first Lakers appearance on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to play hasn't been determined yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell said James might play in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump Meeting Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a rush-to-day rally campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, including stopping at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the verification vote being held for him to vote to fill the void in the Federal Court, Trump aims to win support for the next midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET on this night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to face a trial this week for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over prosecution of sexual misconduct with the verification of a Senate vote that is expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main target of the hasty rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of November elections.
President Trump's campaign said the next five meetings would be to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in our country heading for a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won more than 40 per cent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. teams show courage to fight in ensuring hopes are still heading for a single match on Sunday
After three side-by-side matches, Saturday afternoon's corner game is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time.
Swinging momentum is a concept of sport that is an invention but it is truly trusted by players, and more so in a game like this.
Where's the momentum now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now it's four points, so we're bringing a little bit of momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe of course has an advantage, four points ahead with twelve more points to grab.
American players, as Spieth says, feel they have a little advantage and a sense of encouragement, not only from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth displays the game of venom from start to green area and serves as an example to other players.
A lively outcry sounded even more intense as he continued to move forward, making an important streak to match the four points when he and Thomas missed after two points.
His streak that gave them victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are a different character from Europe but love four points out of four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do the night on Saturday evening, but they also avoided the night on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their energy is given and demonstrated by supporters is evidence that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player is more popular to block the possibility of a European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best that both of them are in different places.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson simplified the work of Sergio Garcia, the four-player hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One night and two doubles in the first nine holes made it difficult for the Spaniard and the Swedish player.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and ahead on the last day, but the four sessions also showed the U.S. team had the courage that was previously doubted by many, including local fans.
European teams go 10-6 ahead to the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable edge on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball and four-player game with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari ahead with two wins over Tiger Woods who are struggling to bring their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side led by Thomas Bjorn sought to retain the trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the mistaken American side on a four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 draw.
The U.S. forces gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two matches, but were unable to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points during him and Molinari, dubbed "Mollwood" after a thrilling weekend was the second pair to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together beat Woods and new American player Bryson Dechambeau in a 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, showed excellence but has now lost 19 of 29 games four balls and four players and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the four-ball morning session, returned to match with Henrik Stenson in a four-man game to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2<0x26>1 - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe is not lucky on a quiet and relaxed day in southwest Paris.
Three-time major championship winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became gaugewood for America by two points on Saturday.
They gained a 2<0x26>1 victory defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4<0x26>3 match in a four-player game that lost in two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team that missed four points heading into a singles match, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
After taking second place for two days, Sunday's counterattack seemed beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's "impossible" to disarm voluntarily without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that persistent sanctions have caused their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that his country will voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "essential goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down nuclear test sites and promising not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in the security of our country and in such circumstances, it would be impossible for us to disarm ourselves voluntarily first."
While Ri reprimanded North Korea's opposition to Washington's "steady" approach to nuclear termination in which North Korea would be rewarded for it taking its step incredibly, the statement seemed important as it did not reject the voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to seek a "nuclear termination of the Korean peninsula" while Trump assured North Korea's security.
North Korea tried to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang should release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to comply with the recommendations to loosen international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "first termination" and increases levels of pressure in sanctions to achieve their goals forcibly, and even opposes the "end declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can weaken us is the empty dreams of those who don't know us.
But the problem is the ongoing restrictions that worsen our disbelief."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the U.S. leader during the United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the parties in the issue of the termination were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear termination from the Korean peninsula would not have met a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "Mr. Evil President" named Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations conference, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and restrictions need to remain until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time period for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we experience a fully, definitive and final nuclear termination."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile financing program.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after that he had condemned him for making "a gangster-like claim."
North Korea has pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that "the same steps" that Kim was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and headed towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken the course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to combat the increasingly becoming-so through caffeine-based learning culture.
A teacher finds students in the world's number one university often unable to understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard School of Medicine and an expert at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
He gained inspiration to start the course after giving lectures on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help with academic and sports performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students lacked sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of the dormitory room, where students click coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture proud of ‘wake up all night’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep quality, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in the mode of starvation, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and after sleep, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' released by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat in the opponent's spot when Dolly Menga's tie tied weaker Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side are still looking for the first win in the opponent's spot since February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as a manager to cause his side to miss eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's predecessor Hearts.
It exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equalizing the position.
With Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And Rangers may face problems again after the lineman, Calum Spence was forced to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from his team area.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on his team that reached the semi-final of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt retains Livi 11's side who stole one point from Hearts last week and he is certainly happy with the way his team plays that worries their opponents all the time.
Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston did more attempts on the goal.
They were supposed to score just after two minutes when the first touchdown of Menga gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
The free kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained only hopeful in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian man's appeal.
Rangers only managed to make two attempts right in the first half but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly easily sidelined Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's weak-kick.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite to the rhythm of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' planned moves.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher dragged the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made an exchange during break time by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate effect when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the impressive Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing teams to play the games they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending away for a long pass.
Holt's side were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor defended well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's lead missed from the goal point.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty kick as he collided with the Jacobs but once again Thomson ignored him.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Calculator
And now, the page of our Almanac's "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as Penger.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has become the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Calculator, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use these earphones, you can actually hear the effect of atoms being given by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: Yeah, it sounds now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify evil cells as part of treatment
The method involved is extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory.
It can "see" proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then re-injected.
The experimental vaccine showed a stimulating result in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells, recovering from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from patients, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is prevalent to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating this type of leukemia.
Kanye West joins Pro-Trump Cercaan, wearing a MAGA Hat, after her SNL appearance.
It's not well received.
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would compete in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town in which he wore a ‘Make America Great' hat, he continued to oppose Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Many times I asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racialist?'
If I'm concerned about racism, I've moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star reappeared Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee on alleged sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to taunt the West with the shipment.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulties behind the stage about his hat.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said, "I'm in a place that doesn't matter," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that point of no importance?" by saying that he's going to "put on my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
The comments he invited ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio is quiet."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised a lot of people with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's conservative group leader Candace Turner, who wrote: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for your work on Criticism."
Karen Hunter, a spokeswoman for the interview, said West was "just being her and that's great."
"But I chose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accept and share ideologies that harm my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the man who used to be known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist previously known as Prince.
An attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be present at the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington tosses toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has stereotyped the Maco hero, by mentioning his character played on-screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "there's something wrong" and questioned how to deal with toxic masculinity issues in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strong" about dealing with the issue.
"I think it's quite personal, right now - where's our fault with masculinity?" he said.
"What did we learn when we were growing up, from the problems we're seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What's natural and what's being taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they need to be like this?
I think that's one of the most important questions nowadays - how do we change it?
"There's something wrong with young people today."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not perform any preliminary or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series expires next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in the reprocessing film True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed that he considered a meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this plan, so by the way, it gave me a future family and my life started from here," he said.
Rose brought in the character of Ygritte, Jon Snow's love of heart played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are infected through sex, signaling a change from before.
HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasingly becoming.
Because of the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies his staff leaking GOP senator data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the claim had been spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and websites.
"Scams, scams and more serious scams are serious," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information is reported to include the home address and phone number for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses that identified the cause of the posts linked to Waters offices and spread the information of Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These baseless allegations are false and a lie," Waters said again.
"My staff - where his identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false allegations - has absolutely nothing to do with this information leak.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and fraudulent."
Waters' statements promptly brought criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he has no characteristic of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motives of the defendants.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who looked too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competed to beat Waters in the mid-election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news that it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities about these false allegations.
"We will make sure the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can be devastating and dangerous to any and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Review Again - Rowan Atkinson's weak intelligence scam
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of Johnny English's action-comedy fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a joke about how bad we are to become a new exporter of the country?
In any case, Johnny English, who likes to shake his eyes and face bored the chance to ruin the situation for the second time - the signal's name is more than anything else that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the territory of a non-English movie audience.
He is, of course, a bizarre secret agent to relax glamour in the nature of Clouseau, little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious international traveler and intelligence agent Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving behind the chaos afterwards.
There was one or two great moments in JE's latest film.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing a medieval armor and fan blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being aired, but his humor feels very weak and bizarre, especially "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke felt like it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me the mistake of Johnny English was accidentally uninnovated and focused on Atkinson's films in the Bean persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field and disappointing the agent in charge - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for a proud prime minister who was struggling with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gave her best with Teresa May's side character but there was nothing good in the script for her character.
His advisor told him every active spy had been compromised, and he had to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is clumsy and now works as a school teacher in some luxurious places, but gives an inappropriate lesson to be a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers spying science in academies like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played back by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a rather destructive character hosted by Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the brilliant Batman and Robin in Her Majesty's Secret Service, return to action in the face of Olga Kurylenko's beautiful teaser female character Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the malicious Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their adventures with a small task: disguised as waitress, lit fire and set fire to French restaurants; ventured to smuggle himself into the luxury cruise ship Volta; and English sparked chaos as he tried to use the Maya Reality headphones to familiarize himself in Volta's house.
All the funny scenes were brought well for the last half, but because it looked friendly and low-lying, there was a little taste like a child's television show about it.
It's a very simple movie.
And like other Johnny English movies, I'm always thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that fits his talent?
Nafi Labour Party plans for British citizens to work four days a week but is paid for five days
Labour Party chairman Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will see British citizens working four days a week - but paid for five days.
The party reportedly wanted the company's bosses to channel savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It will see staff enjoying the weekend for three days - but still bringing home the same pay.
The source said the idea was "compatible" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
Switching to work for four days a week is backed by the Congress of the Working Union as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A right-hand source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "Policy studies are expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It won't happen overnight, but working four days a week is an aspiration that suits the party's approach to balance the economy and favor the workers and the overall industry strategy of the party."
The Labour Party was not the first to back up the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, these aspirations are not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor trial last week by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the "faceless director" and "faceless" at the utility firm.
The plan also meant that current shareholders in water companies might not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government could make a "cut" based on the reason they were deemed guilty.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company's board of directors and establish an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 per cent of private sector firm equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the findings of the bureau could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview posted on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy looks more open than his friend from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I told you I wanted to go to the trial, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, whose allegations appeared, and said, "Did you do it?"
He's strong, strong, clear."
However, Graham's decision was made.
"I've already made the tenting decision of Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take heavy charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett persistently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he calls can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any changes."
Is the World People's Party and has the event done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that has an impressive array of great stars and a equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands gathered at the Central Park Great Site to not only watch performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive free tickets for this event (unless you are willing to pay for VIP tickets), these concert visitors need to complete some tasks, or "actions" such as being a volunteer, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
What is the extent of the world's success with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand something, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" - making someone feel they've done something by just signing a petition online or by sending a breach?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said they have recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, urging movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of them had already been distributed or collected.
The group also estimates that the identified fund has impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Several important committees, including the Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK-based investors and implementations committed to "helping children achieve their full potential", pledged to donate <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 shots from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this unbalanced dietary social injustice a history," Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman said during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has pledged to finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answering one of the Frequently Asked Questions on his website asking "What makes you think we can end hard poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and will take time - there are times when we will be disappointed and desperate.
But, just like the movement demanding civil rights and antiapartheid before, we will succeed, because as we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among several artists who also performed at this year's show in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "restriction" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Secretary of State
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved at the invitation of the Syrian government - was said to be looking for a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to master the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open, and if necessary, to prevent them from being marketable," he said.
Zinke said this during a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of oil consumers" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, stressing the same action.
"Economic choices over Iran and Russia are roughly the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its oil-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquid natural gas exports to Europe that are much cheaper to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade the German nation to withdraw from the "heavy side" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin blocked by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will estimate the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin denies Washington's so strong opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we agree that the energy supply should not be used as a weapon to pressure and consumers should be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has invited Germany's dissatisfaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called for the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there is a third country interfering in our country's energy supply issues," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Think Cook-Up” to Compete as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senators said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think about cooking" before becoming presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When questions were open with residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes putting a woman at the top of her head," she said in a report by The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll think about his timing to be presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern for President Donald Trump when the question was open, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before a vote is made."
However, a one-quarter greeting on Thursday showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to a survey of the University Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The survey also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest, with 38 per cent supporting him potentially contesting and 48 per cent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democrats who are also discussed as potential contestants in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin highlights post-Trauma stress disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are suffering from this PTSD problem and those who are returning home with injuries," he said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his son's detention event was "significant" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "they went home differently, quite harshly and wondering if they would be commended for their sacrifice to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports a ban on the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support against a U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing from attacks by groups of violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts made friends registration to a court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who opposed this policy, NBC news reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. The suit session made by the American Union of Civil Liberties filed in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "a member of his son's violent group" had been hurting him but U.S. officials had rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's in Texas.
Prosecutors from the states in favour of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who have the highest number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with bad group problems and domestic violence.
The new policy of the US asylum application returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Appeal Board of immigrants has allowed migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The prosecutor, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "did not regard the state, federal and international laws that existed decades ago."
"The federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances that led to the application, and prevents it from violating the principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy that prevented the entry of immigrants would deteriorate the U.S. economy by saying the possibility of these immigrants becoming entrepreneurs and "being the necessary workforce."
Public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judge to no longer provide asylum to the victims who fled due to domestic violence crimes and the violence of the evil group in June.
Asylum will be granted to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed because of racism, religion, citizenship or because of belonging to a particular social group or holding on to a different policy," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces on a daily basis.
Rescue work is becoming more and more frequent in Palu while death toll increases
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The feeling is very depressed," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is breastfeeding her fever-stricken baby boy in the city centre of Palu who has been abducted.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
The water supply is very small."
Residents seem to be slowly returning home to their abrupt home, looking for their belongings in the water while trying to save what is possible.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been damaged by an earthquake at an overwhelming magnitude of 7.5.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the aftershock.
His tears flowed as he scanned back as the quake shook the room on the five-storey hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Not to save ourselves.
I'm stuck in a collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice calling for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to my wife and kids.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘violating’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after a Chinese official posted a four-page ad in a U.S. press detailing the common good of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid ads in the Des Moines Register - the most-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing the country of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections explain what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
Being a common practice for foreign governments posting ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now clashing in a worsening trade war with each putting tariffs on their imports.
China's initial actions in this trade war were to target exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party represented by Trump, Chinese and US national experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijng's move had troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press room in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now more bullied by broadcasting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government received the freedom practiced by the Americans, a tradition that puts freedom of speech and freedom of the press first," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the Beijing press, there is very little opposition voice and you can't see people's real views on the ecnomic direction of China's country because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China avoided an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans dismiss female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh's story, warning by analysts
While many renowned Republicans backed and sided with Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Federal Court facing sexual harassment charges, analysts warned they would invite a response in particular from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotion envelops this story and most Republicans say in their records will continue with the vote.
Such things cannot be changed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, said in an article published on Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to militarize angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" while pointing to feelings in the Senate building compound as Republicans ruling the Justice Committee voted to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic passion and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for female voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, who do not like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against him by the Federal Court candidates, analysts thought there would be a riot if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has been very complicated for the GOP," Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds in becoming a federal judge, it's also about how Republicans subscribe to the matter and how they treat him," Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be divided into two and don't know who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half in favor of Ford.
YouGov's recent survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or should have cheated in his testimony, while only 30 percent spoke the same thing about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one more charge, Deborah Ramirez reported.
Last week Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh accused him of being drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his genitals in front of Ford when a party while he was studying at Yale University around the 1980s.
World Website Creators Plan to Start a New Internet Network to Influence Google and Facebook
The creator of the World Website, Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses the open source software created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's real purpose is "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain a list of contacts, a daily work list, a calendar, a list of songs and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify which are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this personal tallan is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information required.
The company called it "personal control through data."
Ihlam for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring in certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developer staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
Starting this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their own free apps without centering on any location using the equipment found in the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team had no discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all of their business models will change immediately.
“We do not ask for their truth.”
In a press release in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "the mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the intergritency and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Website Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has argued out loud about the need for websites to be independent.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Website Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of websites," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Priest celebrated
The only clergy from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in the homeland after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Priest Benard Vann received this award on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bentenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and did not immediately find out he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest award of the British military.
A memorial stone was erected and opened the curtain by two of his grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "glorious symbol" because the stone would be opened 100 years after his grandfather's daring action.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "full of thick fog and overrunning a great assault on the gun."
Then he slipped into the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led it before jumping up with a gun alone and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Micheal Vann, 72, said her grandfather’s action was “something I couldn’t possibly repeat and was so encouraging.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a flower necklace after the movement led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Pancaragam.
Micheal Vann said it was "very honored to be equal in this movement" and added "true courage with the support given by so many."
MMA fans watch all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch the Bellator 206 but disappointed from watching the main show.
San Jose's list of 13 matches, including six major matches that will be aired live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a collision, the audience in the UK was stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they were watching the whole night to watch the game.
One of the fans said the exchange to a child's cartoon channel was "an unpleasant joke" through his broadcast.
"Government rules indicate that the broadcast at 6 a.m. was not suitable for matches so they were forced to broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior marketing and communications vice president when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa is Khinzir," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that audiences in the UK could watch it.
"I think when I talk about the re-release, I think we can do something," Coker said.
"But at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday we couldn't do anything until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, there's a lot of bad news out there and it's not good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more about the government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that's impossible for the fans.
It's a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sense of "low self" against sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley said he grew up feeling low because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she talked about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he didn't really care much about winning the Olympics.
Remaining presenter in this long-running show, Kris Young is on vacation for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" peers as he grew up because "he was not socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others are the things that have driven me and given me the strength to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to prevent more countries from turning homosexuality into a crime.
He said he spoke like this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the events of falling in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - were "imminently unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age environment who went through the same challenges.
The couple became father in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the perspectives" of his life had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's just about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's more than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Her son's name is Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether their tickets to London 2012 had been purchased - because he wanted to sit in front once.
"I didn't reach my heart to say 'father's not likely to be there to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and was legally dead until I realized that my father would not live forever."
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country at the Olympics, there's no other sense that can match this," he said.
It was also the source of inspiration for her first choice of songs - "Proud" by Heather Small - who starred at her while preparing for the Olympics and still made her roman hair swell.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not very willing to face the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be prepared to make up for the game's performance so as not to end with sadness.
Mickelson, who will play in this dual-year event for a record 12 times, has been rested by captain Jim Furyk for the games "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Behind the usual focus for the United States, the winner of these five major competitions spent time as a cheerleader and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where his long distance is extremely difficult for a hit that doesn't meet the goal.
And if the golf course is inconvenient, Mickelson in Sunday's ninth match will clash with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, a four-point loss starting with 12 single games, starts fiercely, then Mickelson's game is definitely very important.
Furyk is so confident with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and he slaps his shoulder and puts his hand on my shoulder and says he will be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is very high.
He's been a big fan of the team and has been doing a lot of work this week.
I may not have imagined that he would play in two games.
I imagined more than that, but that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he has joined the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought a spirit injection to his team.
"He's funny, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people's clothes and it's fun to be in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
He's not just playing, but more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their position ahead will soon disappear.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew from his experience that the far ahead position he had could be lost in the last day of the Ryder Cup and make things difficult.
The Danish first participated in the 1997 game at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and led the American side by 5 points but was only able to win very thinly with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 points.
"You keep reminding yourself after the forward position at Valderrama; we also got the lead position at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but won slim," Bjorn said after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead with 10-6 points at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting all the time tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
This isn't over as long as the eyes haven't been picked up and displayed on the lightboard.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
I've said I'm going to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who our opponents are - they are the greatest players in the world.
Excited by his men's achievements on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly guess.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's performances must be highlighted and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything goes well but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he'll have to give his best in him as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's views, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his player to play well as an individual player compared to a team event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three points out of four.
Furyk himself had experiences on the last day where positions changed, while in a winning team at Brookline before losing shock when European teams performed "Miracles in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said in response to Ben Crenshaw's question, the captain in 1999 burned the player's spirit on the last day.
"We've got 12 more tomorrow, but if you all want to start it as fast as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medinah.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're going to put our players in line with a procedure that we think is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of battling back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who are in the top of the first division.
"I made this rule because I think it's going to keep it and cover it all at once," Bjorn said of the choice of individual players.
Germany's new warship is delayed again.
The German Navy should accept its newest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War era, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the warship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-office problem struck the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class frigate.
It is understood that it will contain features such as high-powered cannon, a variety of flying antiship and antiship fittings as well as some unseemly features such as reducing detection by radar, red light and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature is a longer long-term maintenance distance - this new frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its base.
However, a range of obstacles means that this sophisticated warship, which is said to be able to highlight German power overseas, will be outdated by the time the ship joins the Navy service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was headlined last year when German Navy officials refused to authorize the warship and returned it to the construction company Blohm <0x26> Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known about why the ship was returned, but German newspapers mentioned some of the damage to the "properties and devices" made these warships useless when sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software should be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be operated by only 120 sailors - half of what is needed to handle the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is also a matter where these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tan "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warships in the same class used by German troops during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including training for the sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - rising from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem that hit the new frigate warships shows how much German naval capabilities were missed.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in parliament, admitted that the navy was facing a shortage of capable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not receive replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is the life of bats.
A recent study underway at a Scottish highlands estate aims to explain why bats use the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to recent discoveries about the unique behavior of mammals capable of flying and can be used as a guide for conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual bats, and soprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in certain locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also make moving surveys using mobile detectors.
Experts analyze the sounds of all recordings will identify the frequency of each type of bat and its species and the actions of these bats.
A map of habitats and reports will be produced to create a picture of the earth's surface on a scale with respect to the behavior of bats.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results of this study will show the most important habitat areas to bats and the way they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making grasslands and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably since the last century.
Bats are threatened by building and development work that interferes with where bats live and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats similar to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location tracking techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very concerned with bats.
They have ten well-trained experts who frequently conduct surveys, checking for shelters and sometimes saving bats.
The organization has also established the first bat protection centre in Scotland in Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland live.
David Thompson said this estate is the most suitable place for bats.
"In Thereave we have a very suitable place for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, many large trees and suitable habitats.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we run here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to conduct inspections before starting maintenance work in real estate because there is a possibility that by accident we can destroy bat nests that will contain bat children where this is capable of killing 400 bats and bats, and possibly destroying the entire population of local bats.
Bats are protected and are mistaken for killing, torturing or disturbing or destroying the spot where bats nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help.
He said: "There's still a lot to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their population grows."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyer prepares to sue German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of raping him as "fake news" and that some people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer will prosecute the German magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was then said to have paid <0x24>375,000 to close the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they are saying today is fake news," the winner of the 5 Ballon d'Or awards told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Normally.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "a report that is unfounded and disrupts personal space," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim damages for "moral damages that directly interfere with his personality, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident was reported in June 2009 in a luxury room of Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of violating the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident that the player knelt in front of him and said he was "99 per cent" a "good man" and only fell for "one per cent."
The document confirms that Ronaldo claims to have sex, but on the basis of likes.
Mayorga also claimed he made a police report and took pictures of the injuries he suffered while in the hospital, but later agreed to resolve it outside the court because he was "fearful of the response" and worried that it would be "overwhelming by the public."
The 34-year-old now wants to cancel the previous solution because it is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester when the charges took place, and this summer he has moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ for losing car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He also added that it was a bit "difficult" because Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would temporarily stop production of its factory cars in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the consequences of this would result in shipping problems at the border if there was no solution for Brexit and this would lead to job loss.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis - installed nearly 150,000 units of cars last year, 90<0x25> of which are exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion if Britain is out of the European Union without any solution by the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW as well as Jaguar and Land Rover, said they were worried that the UK would leave the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said they would shut down their mini-car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The car manufacturers' main concern is about the risks to supply networks in the event of a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's production of cars depends on the installation base based on the receipt of timely supplies without having to be kept with car parts brought to the factory every 37 minutes from around the UK and the European Union for the booked cars.
If the UK is out of the European Union without any solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be unrest at the border that industry players predict there will be delays and shortages of replacement materials.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plan on bilateral relations with the European Union "must be done with certainty to avoid any border checks."
“We need a solution. We want a solution that will enable not only success for the moment but for us to achieve this opportunity,” he told the BBC on Radio 4’s Today programme.
"Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to continue this highly successful supply chain.
Toyota can't say how long its production will be stopped, but over the long term it warns it will increase costs and reduce the factory's competitiveness and in turn will result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the working union responsible for the management of the union at the factory, said members of the union had already begun to worry: "According to my experience, the lost job will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and solid plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may have been "rejected to next week" because of a dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a candidate for a federal court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of Robert Mueller's special lawyer's probe on Russian interference in elections, relations between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is going to fire a deputy prosecutor or not and further disrupt Mueller's freedom to continue investigations has become Washington's hottest gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein planned to use a secret recorder tool to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president using a 25-constitutional amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, behind reports saying he would resign.
Instead, it was announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to prevent him from colliding with the confession of Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of violating her, before the Senate's judicial committee, which both of them gave confessions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which had further suspended a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, maybe this week, I think it may be delayed in a week due to some of the things happening in the federal court.
We'll see later and I'll always be giving the latest updates to the press.
Some reporters will dispute this: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold a lot of press conferences not because he didn't like TV journalists who were trying to find "attention," but he added: "I don't agree because they really want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would increase.
"The president has held the most question-and-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without giving any evidence. "We have made a calculation."
The press conference will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen that we've done a lot since last week and this will replace the press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press when on the way out of the White House or when participating in an open question-and-answer session or during a press conference along with honorary guests.
Individual media meetings are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he occasionally made an independent and bizarre appearance in front of a gathered reporter.
Health Secretary writes to European Union employees in the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State has written a letter to all employees of the European Union who work in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to bear the cost of the application of European Union residents working in its public sector.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the withdrawal have continued, and are heading towards achieving results by autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face a scenario without a solution.
I know it's something that's really bothering you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each of you's contributions, regardless of your nationality.
Co-workers from across the European Union and other countries, bring together many experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is where you all live and we want you all to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Chief coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly fell there," Reed said.
The trainer and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the stove and taking him for further treatment.
A Tennessee State official told Chirs Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the type/how far the injury is currently" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red first-year student, played in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had already made five starts on Saturday before leaving the game, his total of starts this season was 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they purchase real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and this surplus money will be used to help homeless people under Tory's latest plans.
This will lead to Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
These stamp duties will be charged on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasures are expected to quote up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK - money from this will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The move seems to be to bolster Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
This increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these proceeds will help the government overcome the problem of people who have no place to live.
This addition is an addition to stamp duty that has already been imposed including higher duties that have been introduced two years ago over a second house and a house purchased for rent that may be charged three percent.
Treasury is expected to be able to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this step.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new properties are bought by non-UK citizens, causing prices to soar and make it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Most of the luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" because many of their owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could afford their first home.
He accused the large construction company of deliberately maintaining high real estate prices by purchasing land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable homes to address Britain's "humiliating housing problems."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including rental controls and abolishing the expulsion of "innocents."
He also wanted more power to be given to the councillors to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restore the British dream - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that's meant to improve our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to stay, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies to buy homes compared to British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is very far away, and the fact that living in a place with disdain is a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "main goal" was to become a Scottish manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to re-emphasize the North-East club, ranked third in League One, less than three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and so far," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always attracted me there.
The only chance would come if I was successful as a manager at the club level.
Ross' successors as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athetic said he did not feel threatened by the name of the big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me, the success at the moment is 'can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities that are in the club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I think I'll be successful if I can get this club back into the Premier League."
Ross was only three years in management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being relegated and changed the fate of St Mirren from being relegated to Champions next season.
And Ross said he's more comfortable now than he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalled, when he took care of Allaah.
"I know that the game is better than playing with me.
It may sound strange because I'm successful, I can live a happy life and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and pressure working as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I always wanted to take care of it and now I’m doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something that I liked throughout my adult life.”

The best time to drink beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heat wave brought good luck to British pubs that faced problems but networked restaurants were under pressure.
The pub and bar groups showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy firm, which collects these figures, said: "The continued hot weather and the longer England World Cup campaign mean July will follow the June pattern, where pubs rose 2.8 percent, except restaurants dropped worse.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June worsened in July.
The performance of the pub that puts drinks and bars ahead is very strong compared to the declining restaurants.
Pubs that prioritize food also have bad luck as a result of hot weather, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
Most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst from RSM, said: "This decision seems to be the same and continues since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the outdoor market.
It's no surprise that restaurants have fallen by 4.8 per cent this year, and the prices will be even worse.
"The long summer weather hits restaurant operators at severe times and only time will determine if the colder weather like we experienced in August will bring relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July showing moisture in the brand newly introduced.
Observers for the sales sector in UK pubs, bars and restaurants The Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data performance from 47 operating groups with a turnover worth <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion is an industry benchmark.

A study by the UK Digital Awareness and the Higher Teachers Conference (HCM) of independent schools found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they were keeping personal accounts.
HCM Chairman Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming to see so many teenagers get stuck creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics board as the non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a renowned Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explains this move is an opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from Doyle, who has had a lot of international experience for more than a decade.
"Ilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly with his participation in this board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport at Scotand.
The American athlete who won the gold medals for the 200 meters and 400 meters event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta now has four Olympic gold medals and is now making coverage for the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a heart attack.
He said: "Today I was hit by a stroke.
I can't walk.

Mother's milk pump advertising that makes comparisons with cows brings conflicting opinions online
A company producer of breast milk pumps got a wide range of contradictory opinions online because their ads compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked for milk.
To launch what is said to be the world's first "silent and wearable mother's milk pump" consumer technology company Elvie has released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers who use the new pump can feel.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow ward to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this is not a nipple, this is my breast."
She said, "I'm going out, pump out, pump out, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping out my breasts."
However, these ads published on the firm's Facebook page have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has invited a wide range of reactions from the public, many say it provides a cheerful picture of the dairy industry that is "thrilling".
"It's an unnatural decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"Like us, cows need to bunting and have children to produce milk, but unfortunately the calf is divorced from the mother within a few days of their birth," one author said.

Another commented: "Of course it's a trauma for cows and calves.
"But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another adds: "An advertisement that doesn't have anything to do with it directly."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "very funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give the body milk.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's kind of crazy.
It's a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at moms who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "cow."
This is not an advertisement that praises or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all dancing with a hidden pump in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the response that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be loaded secretly in a shirt in breastfeeding, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women pumping with milk cows, we would like to put the body's milk pumping and all the challenges associated with it as a primary focus, while demonstrating ways of entertaining and connecting with feeling free through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Ellie's pump has become a headline.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved silently to tent camps on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrants is increasing even though monthly border transfers have not changed much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making the placement of children with guarantors increasingly difficult.
Traditionally, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid of affecting their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective guarantors and other adult members of the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either guarantors or family members of guarantors, are here illegitimately and most of them are unauthorized immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt down the individual,” Albence said.
In order to process children faster, authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through video convocation calls, from personal attendance, to appeal their case for a legitimate position before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are under detention, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to angry acts or attempts to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents say that such concerns are higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children struggle with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They add that by moving children to a camp city without preparing time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends may exacerbate the trauma they face.
U.S., French and Turkish troops withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, although war in the country has reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the trick to combat terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terrorism has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we eliminate Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specially for training and advising Kurdish and Arab Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is held between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the rebel-held region of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Russian-Turkish talks have diverted major attacks by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "real time limits" and hoped that military actions would target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, which "will be abolished."
The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to organize the first meeting of the new committee, which contains governments and opposition members to draft a post-war campaign and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking current constitutional articles," and warning against interference.
Trump will win the second term
With that in mind, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expect, dismissal charges and scandals end his presidential post before his time.
In a situation that is undeniable as "the most dramatic finale for a presidential post!"
At the moment, there is no sign of a sneak peek.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average audience time of 2.4 million, an additional of 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" has ahead of the cable rating, up to 3.5 million viewers on the night of the prime news.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," a story about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of entertainment in the game.
True, unlike what is on TV, a storyline originating from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether the immigrant family can reunite or the health of the global economy.
Not keeping up with developments is just a pleasure for the lucky audience.
However, it's far from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing about the use of 'deep background' by Bob Woodward' in search of a source for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 ostrich skin bomber jacket ("the thick fabric of the magnificently self," says The Washington Post, Daniel Stotor) and a full-sense description.
I'm not going to see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Part of what he does looks like in a reality program that looks like he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with actors' exchange and daily plot exchange (starting a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

He could not leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh was set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was still uncertain.
"I remember when we made a crazy show before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it was real."

External money floods into the middle-election council's fierce competition
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th elections show a flood of money, as the re-election of congressional districts shows two ministers currently competing for the same seat.
The reworked suburb of Pittsburgh contested representative Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current employee, Republican deputy Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, who overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was reprinted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been gerrymandered alongside the Republican.
The new 17th competition has begun a fierce financial campaign competition between the major party financial machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name heard in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political intelligence has given the Democrats the advantage.
U.S. plans to end El Salvador due to China's support, then retreat
Dominican and Panama diplomats have recognized Beijing, with few negative responses from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Government officials decided to call back the head of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominica Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, will have a negative impact on the Central American country with high rates of harassment and murder.
After an internal meeting was held, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any considerations for fining El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import of administrative places in the meeting, diplomat said.
And all three American representatives returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Republic of Dominica with no decisive messages or fines from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of sterling.
Their descriptions are supported by external analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on condition of stereotypes.
Historical Studies
What is to come next may be Robert Mueller's special lawyer's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has strong evidence in the general record.
Mueller will also direct an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our elections.
If congress changed hands, Trump would face responsibility for the party, as soon as he was prepared to face the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury containing his counterparts.
It's all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's downfall must have happened - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact how long this struggle will take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup attempt against Hitler, if the West had not followed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the cruel murders that took place in the next few years.
The journey of history revolves around such a point of inflection, and the journey of undisturbed democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these points of inflection now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, last year, he had planned to record the president and speculate that the president was not eligible for the post.
Rosenstein said The Times' statement was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the new request for the FBI's investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is certified to the Agong Court despite the apparent charges of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for the congressional debate over which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika.
With that being my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his advance appearance this season up to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers use this decision as a stepping stone for a great win.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the belief that we're going to get something and we've got one point.
We might win at the end of the game, but the series may be a fairer result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
"We hope we get three points but the match is difficult because they got good results in the previous game but, the audience support us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
"Last year it was difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries, and the progress in the club, but there's a fun factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team is having fun; training is good too.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of this anxiety.
While the participants' surveys have a clear idea of how they want to be preserved, some have even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the indududus in a nationwide study reported that they had discussed with their partners about long-term maintenance costs.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but don't take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the nationwide insurance business.
Here's a way to start.
Talk to your spouse and child: You won't be able to prepare the family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your advisors and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as such choices will be an important factor to know the cost.
Take your financial advisor: your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Financing funds for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Complete your legal documents: Complete the legal war at one time.
Set a healthcare representative in place so that you can appoint an individual you trust to supervise your healthcare and ensure a professional according to your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a representative's letter of authority for your finances.
You'll choose the person you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're not able to.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the money that's set, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What is medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set the pace."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and a strong tsunami breaching the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communications system, authorities were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, a northern area of Palu adjacent to the epicenter of the quake with a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary during the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area is 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The territory, the administrative region under the region, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming became the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala waters.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morawali, on the shores opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismicly located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and has always been hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western region of Acheh, Indonesia in northern Sumatra on Dec 26, has triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A modest quake struck the Pidie Jaya government area in Acheh, causing devastation and panic, reminding residents of the massive destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsumnami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful quake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded during that time.
Sarah Palin's daughter arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son-in-law of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been detained on charges of carrying out an attack.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of conducting domestic attacks, disrupting domestic violence crime reports and opposing detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while a female friend tried to make a police call to report the allegations of the crime, she had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was detained remanded at Mat-Su's pre-speech facility and detained with unreserved bonds amounting to <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He was confronted in court on Saturday, where he had confessed "certainly, innocence" when asked about recognition, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A minor offences, meaning he may be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a Class B minor offence, sentenced to a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been charged against Palin.
In December 2017, the youth was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the allegations of the attack.
The case is referred to in the Alaskan Military Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic attack, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons in a drunken state related to the incident.
Palin's girlfriend claimed the man had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are also affected by the death toll expected to rise the following day.
Gepa Earth struck outside Tangah Sulawesi located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos published on social media show the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate a party in the town of Palu during the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors demand extraordinary death sentences for NYC terrorist attack suspects
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City suspected terrorist attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary punishment that has no longer been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his lane on Oct.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intended" to kill eight of the victims and "intended" to impose serious bodily injuries, according to notice with intent to demand the death penalty, in a file in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges lead to death, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder for illegal activities, which were always used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "meticulous planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "generally, cruelly and degrading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and losses to Diego's family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has long been indicted for the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty imposed for the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death by using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan resident, did not feel guilty on the day and month after the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to the investigators that he was happy with what was done, according to the police.
Saipov said he was pushed into the attack after seeing a video of ISIS on the phone, according to allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to demand the death penalty instead of receiving the conviction for a life sentence with no possibility of being released, only extending the trauma of this event to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously called for the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during protests at Tory's conference.
Former Ukip chief said politicians should "feel the fragments" of ‘Eurosceptics' - as one of Theresa May's MPs, suggesting she should be given the responsibility to handle negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a parade in Birmingham that the UK "would be out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But May's challenge was to resolve the split between members who supported the Tories Remain Members who joined the protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure Chequers' tolerance plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The allied party insisted May was conducting negotiations with Brussels despite the impact it had on - and the Eurosceptic and Labour powers to choose between his package or 'cause of chaos'.
Bone told the Outgoing rally meant Out at Solihull who wanted to 'dispose Chequers'.
He recommended Farage to be nobility and was given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had been given that responsibility, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MPs added: "I support Brexit but we must throw away Chequers."
Setting up protests against the EU, he said: "We are not fighting in the world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain incorrect at all."
Brexit Tory supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also followed the parade, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voices.
"Chequers aren't popular among the public, the Opposition won't vote in support, it's not popular in our party and the activists who are on the street and who have voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their positions if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians would need to "feel the jaws" if they wanted to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a belief between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them escape by doing so.'
In a message to a passionate audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is nearly betraying Brexit, to feel its shade.
"We are preparing the army of the people who gave us victory in the Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-government, proud."
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
A coalition of activists flew a Tories banner against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives about the safety issues they faced with the party's application as the conference began.
"They said they could hold IT systems in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradictions, for trade without borders," he added.
"It's all a play.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "exercise" to compete for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "studie to contest for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that members of the Massachusetts Democrats delivered their future plans during the ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a strong critic of President Donald Trump, is competing for re-election in November with GOP state rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the 2016 Trump Massachusetts campaign.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's midday event in Holyoke is his 36th meeting with gunners using the ‘town hall’ format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to contest the president's position.
Warren replied it was time for women to go to Washington to repair the broken kingdom, and this includes a woman on the top ladder.
Capture made in the death of the Sims shooter from the LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been detained in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and claimed to be on the scene, had a gun and claimed to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without incident and placed under detention of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior with a height of 6 feet 6 raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and a rebound of 2.9 per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the gap of world championships when his team orders him to win, defeating Sebastian Vettel
It was clearly visible at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's order played a key role in the race.
From the start of the match, Bottas started well, nearly defeating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that was supposed to be final.
Mercedes then went into the pit in the next round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire action to the tyre that made the Ferrari driver leave the inside free of risks for self-defense after the third-angle defense action.
Max Verstappen started from the rear grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went ahead for most of the race and did not change tires to target a quick termination and bypass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He then went into the pit in the 44th round but was unable to increase the speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It was a tough day for Valtteri who had made a good race throughout the weekend and the gentleman nature allowed me to bypass.
The team has done a good job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's a language that's not good.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally on the urging of a woman who he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not respond directly to the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate shows people "cruel and ugly and lying."
"One thing that can happen and a beautiful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you look at the exposures and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Are we leaking...No, we're not leaking," he added, making the senator's facial expression.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaughohleh Ford in July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it as difficult and I kept it as difficult as asked."
But the woman's denial was disliked by the president, who made a comment during Saturday's rally: "I tell you, it's an unpleasant language of gestures.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, crap, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're sacrificing to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee's star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went ahead with a two-goal win through a blow from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored the home standings before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed victory for them.
This was the third Elite League defeat for the season to Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous matches.
The opening for Dwyer arrived at the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's help, with David Rutherford providing assistance while Beauvillier doubled the advance four minutes later.
With what seemed like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the host's eye at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the match during the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first time.
The hosts then gathered again and Bouchard again equated the situation with scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first victory in a late match in the second, and he secured the victory with a fifth team in the middle of the final.
Giants, who have lost four out of five matches are at home, Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Guards Killed to Ensure Hundreds Aboard Fly Over Earthquakes
The Indonesian Air Traffic Controller is considered a hero after being killed after ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Despite his escape from his friend, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan the Great, he refused to leave his place of control at the powerful control tower at Sis Al Jufri's Pearl Airport in Palu.
He did not take steps to ensure that the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to listen to this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many cannot be contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's agency spokesman said.
A 6-metre high wave destroyed the Palu, which will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings the body back.
Clean water is hard to find.
Small stores are being rebuilt everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross organization has rushed to provide assistance to the survivors but we do not know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you willing?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says a passenger is missing after the plane crashed.
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia, said a passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the company has been unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further requests for details about such passengers, such as age and citizenship.
The local boat helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airline and Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the tracks.
Some witnesses felt the plane was missing from the runway.
According to U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency gate of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only got a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the nearby crew on the repaired dock also provided relief using a re-inflatable boat to move passengers to the coast before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network said 111 people had been killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give a woman's night timeline burned alive
Prosecutors rested Saturday's case in a re-talking of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to organize the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was there along with Chambers on the evening of his death, in conflict with previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone along with Chambers' phone as he claimed along with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had "deceived because my truck was in Nashville."
Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they know each other only for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's text and contact information from his phone.
"He's taken this woman out of his life," Hale said.
The prosecutor is scheduled to begin the closing debate on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio want to change the negative outlook of this genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, namely a political message and a social problem.
They want to go back to the base and make hip hop sensibly popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen the latest rise in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY babysitter sued couple who fired him for text "racist"
The New York babysitter sued the couple for discriminating after receiving a text that had been wrongly sent from a mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The pair denied them being racists, equating the suing act as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"Nobody's ever going to be black," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Maurice, and said that the previous caregiver, an African-American, was not doing a good job and she expected the presence of a caregiver from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a working day and sent home with Uber.
Currently, Maurice sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanded compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, compensation for the residence he had offered, without contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't have done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple had retaliated against claims they were racist, saying the act of terminating Maurice's service was reasonable because they felt the woman could not be trusted after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you put your child's care on someone you've been rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
It won't."
Calling the prosecution a "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just two months of childbirth and was in a "hard situation."
“You want to put on someone in such a situation?
"It's not a good thing," added the banker.
As the case progressed, public opinion courts quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publisher fears readers find it difficult to connect with talking bears, a new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the state of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's very exciting when we know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiring to write a children's book, a little toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, adding, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet sweet" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"My dad is a quiet man, he's not a big talker," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like feeling like you have a child who achieves something you're proud of even if it's not what you're making it.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I have to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, the girl's daughter was sent to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice in a hurry where doctors have done her best to save her life.
"Nad called me often to say that things were bad and he wouldn't be able to be saved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave the system.
He died before his time and this is all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was all going to happen.
I can't scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I have to hold it."
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her son, boarded a plane with other passengers - who did not know about the bitter experience she was experiencing.
"Nobody knows," he said.
“I bowed my head, and tears were flowing all the time.
It’s hard to describe, but on this journey I feel sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman sends postcards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one who committed suicide, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mom to feel like I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said her son was a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knows him with his smile.
They always say that their smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother at the time met his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried that this will cause other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to inform people that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit still - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his attitude.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or anything."
He said the death of his partner was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "He made a big hole in the family.
It makes us split up.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the FBI's investigation
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited time investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to the unit," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "difficult" in a deadlock based on bubble-rooted beliefs.
Why do Republicans and Kavanaugh don't want the FBI to investigate?
Their disapproval is due to their discomfort.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and on November 6 - if as expected, Republican results are unsatisfactory, they will weaken to get the person they want to appoint for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush had made a call to the Senators, lobbying them in support of Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became secretary to Bush.
What will happen after the FBI has filed a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats convened.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, deputy president, to equalise the series and confirm his position in the Agong Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has diminished since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - dating to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang does not provide any public reviews.
Most of the North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ Free Zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants not political refugees and often sends them back forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on a delayed nuclear power depletion talks.
This comes after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of delaying the development of talks since the incident.
"Without any trust from the United States, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not start nuclear disarmament in advance," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "emotions," and is inappropriately held in the Agong Court
House Minority Chairman Nancy Pelosi called Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his resignation was inappropriate to hold office in the Agong Mahlamah.
Pelosi made the following reviews in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they'll say she's 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both adolescents.
At the opening of the statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when talking about family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "extremely and defamatoryly organized" handled by liberals who are still angry Hilary Clinton was killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was not eligible to hold office in the Agong Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel that he has eliminated his own qualifications and his actions against the Clinton family and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to prosecute Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he wasn't eligible to hold office in the Agong Court, but only in the courts he is now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was held as a conservative court.
In the verification trial, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the ruling of the Agong Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'How much fun,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to show it.
It was a reasonable word of nista, an inflammation that was months and years abundant, and he did not hold back his anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's an amazing thing, do you agree?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had created a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most unforgettable memories of the old job, in a man-dominated office, I found myself crying with an unstoppable irritation, I was pulled by an older woman at the neck - a cold manager I was stunned - pulling me into the ladder room.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having a secret relationship in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, feeling there was no reason to stop him from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates competing and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to the events taking place at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an effort to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete until she got <0x24>2 million.
It was a vain struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man would give him just <0x24>250.
"Do they feel I have a discount?" he said.
When he said that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt a variety of feelings - grateful to those who supported him, disappointed by the system that made it difficult for him to ask for donations and who targeted non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and he felt a shot.
"You'd think I had a broken soul," Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking at the time, what would I put on my nesting stone?
"She's crying?"
The U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The start of the Trade War between the United States and China may be confusing, and although the fighting is not yet over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most noticeable increase this week with new tariffs that will impact <0x24>200 billion in items worth, such as taxing half of goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing responds in the same way every time, most recently, imposes five to ten per cent tariffs on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington backwards means to submit to the U.S. will, but to subjugate the U.S. is too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War could positively support China in the long run by lowering the interdependence between the two countries.
"A quick political decision by whether Washington or Beijing can initiate uncontrolled economic conditions in any country and looks more dangerous than what observers have previously understood," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think group.
Syria is "ready" to return political refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said the country was ready for the country's voluntary return of political refugees and asked for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations Agong Summit, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for voluntary return of refugees, to the countries they are forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and search points.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to develop the devastated country.
But he insisted the country will not receive conditional assistance or assistance from a country that supports the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. side with a final score of 16.5, 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got the 14.5 matga needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, released a tee blow into the water in the par-3 hole of 16, giving up losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers excelled in all rounds, being 1 out of 4 players 5-0-0 since the format of the competition began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World's top player, Dustin Johnson, went down to 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who may have played last time for the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became the all-time winner of Europe with a peak of 25.5 points.
“I rarely cry but can’t stand today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm very happy and happy to get the cup back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He had handed over the assignment to John Ram who had defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The feeling of pride I felt when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching the man play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods suffered a loss to all competitions in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup job.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players, won 14 major second place championships only on Jack Nicklaus.
USA teams struggled throughout the weekend to find a track, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good golf game throughout the match.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance from his team, "I'm proud of them, they worked hard.
This morning, we're going to give a little bit of money to the European team.
We try our best.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll gather again, I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I love all these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."
Latest Installation of Red Curtains: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

According to the FWC, clustered development conditions were reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier Districts - indicating a reduction in concentration.
The development of the Red Curtain Palast passes an estimated 130 miles of coast from north of Pinellas to the southern Lee area.
The patch can be found at 10 miles in the direction of the Hillsborough district, but in less areas than last week.
The red stripes are also visible in the area of Pasco.
Medium concentration in or towards the sea Pinellas District reported in recent weeks, low to high concentration towards the sea Hillsborough County District, background to high concentration in Manatee District, background to high concentration in or to the Sarasota Region sea. Lower background to moderate concentration of sea areas in Charlotte District, background to background concentration
Respiratory sensations are reported to be ongoing in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier Districts.
Respiratory intensity has not been reported in northwest Florida in recent weeks.
