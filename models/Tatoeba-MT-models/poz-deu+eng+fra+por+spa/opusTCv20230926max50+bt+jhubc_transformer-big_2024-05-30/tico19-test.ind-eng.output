The rapid cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1, to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/Economic Territories and the United Kingdom that confirms that, although the stages vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic develops very quickly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients that will require health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the disease's causative agent was a new coronavirus now called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80<0x25> of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospitalized treatment, while another 6<0x25> of cases develop critical illnesses that require intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we reviewed the cumulative incidence trends of the European Union/EEA (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) in comparison to the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during January 31–March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 2020 Eurosurveillance issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on WHO's definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases were first reported by France on January 24, 2020, on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and Great Britain (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative figures and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified by each country around the world is updated every day at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative incident of 14 days, so take into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and the UK, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present a cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. compared to Italian cases during the period of 31 January–15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK generally follows trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, then sharply increased around February 28, 2020 (additional materials).
This trend is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a trend of increasing similar cumulative COVID-19 incidence (additional materials).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period of January 31–15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative incident of COVID-19 signals that the pandemic is increasing at comparable speeds in all countries.
This is despite differences in stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10<0x25> of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on receiving COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available for 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> of cases (data is not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and mortality rates.
The 2010-2011 study showed a huge variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modeling scenarios related to saturation of healthcare capacity, with an estimated prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK country related to risk <0x3E>90<0x25> beyond intensive care bed capacity, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far cases are classified in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve populations of specific regional service coverage, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Regional Unit Names level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is the case in Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as a rapid increase in cases, as anticipated, may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt appropriate responses if not applied beforehand.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available as the country has the possibility to further increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA state health care system will likely face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has lower levels of severity and mortality than SARS, but is more contagious and more contagious than older people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this newly emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the fast-growing subject of research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review helps to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people ordered to stay at home during the holidays and a few weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus was highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being returned home and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number 1 audience's enemy" and potentially destructive more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established the sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this fast-growing new subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-induced diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15<0x25> of the cold 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each leading to an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the cluster of unknown origin pneumonia was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, an infection of health care providers was reported, signaling that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, the quarantine of the territory was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was discontinued.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients contacted directly with the Wuhan seafood market were considered the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
As the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak is still to be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentered study on 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at age 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected people are over 50 years of age, few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men more (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the beginning to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time ranging from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05) and the custom R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, according to the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases of 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>) and customized mortality for all patients of 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large enveloped viral subfamily containing a single strand of RNA sensation.
CoVs can be divided into four types: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein protrusion or spike (S) cover binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA is accompanied by cover glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98<0x25> among the 10 samples that were sequenced; the sample was taken from the site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin portion of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the protein S SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 is weaker than it binds to the protein S SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that is not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8.
The orf3b protein SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression inhibition; however, orf8 lacks a known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM structure ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in complex with an amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, arranged to form a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which are evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of Origin and Intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96<0x25> identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bats-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, intermediate hosts that helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans are still unknown, and the transmission route remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed a snake as a viral carrier of bats to humans involving a homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that a long-sleeved mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of genetic homology on CoV found in gangiling and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1<0x25> of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence are still not obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TRR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses joined in the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to viruses, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-cells help produce proinflamatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, at worst, failure of compound organs and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by initiation clusters, is more about the elderly with participating diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent the infected person, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early COVID-19 symptom, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, strep throat, sore throat, rhinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the progression of the patient's disease progresses quickly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dispnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely a study on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Compared to that, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dispnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS letality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throat (13-25<0x25>) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support is required for about 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2<0x25> with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 amounted to 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95<0x25> confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV ranged only from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Classified poets are often found in one family or from one association or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or have contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks prior to the onset.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again. This raises alertness to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes lymphocyte count <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood dysentery rate increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels are increased, i.e. fibrin decomposition products in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Thorax photo abnormalities are found in a large number of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injuries, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tactical inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis aggravate the disruption of gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of type I and type II lowers surfactant levels and increases surface pressure thus lowers the ability of the lung to expand and increases the risk of lung collapsing.
Because of this, the worst findings on thorax photos are often parallel to the most severe disease rates.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytes desquamation, the formation of hialine membranes, and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, as well as the syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, in accordance with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occur in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/L intricately (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dip.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with new CoV, doctors mainly offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Tabel 2).
This therapy includes current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicines, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of a recovered patient is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine hurricane is a systemic inflammatory response form marked by the release degenerative of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals which are the main causes of ARDS and failure of compound organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the handling of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include T cell-directed immune response modulation; blocking of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are useless for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, a brief dose of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended to be given with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous remdesivir, an analogue of nucleotides, was found to be beneficial in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after a combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapeutic interaction with other medications used by the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients who have recovered and manufactured antibodies
There is a long history of the collection of blood of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and were injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammatory and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to file such methods for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective filtration of antibodies against proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the production scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear as they are difficult to extract or verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet existed, TCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illnesses.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top rates of recovery in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87<0x25> of its patients, which included Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>), and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which used TCM only at about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of recovery (13<0x25>).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues presented a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptoms worsening (from mild to heavy) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group alone compared to the WM group (7.4<0x25> compared to 46.2<0x25>) and lower mortality in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> compared to 39<0x25>).
However, the efficacy and security of TCM is still waiting for better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify an effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients who are suspected or confirmed to COVID-19 feel extremely afraid of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those in quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phases of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality have been reported.
Tracking compulsory contact and quarantine history, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, people suspected, and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for cutting transmission chains from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which in the long run and effectively makes penetrating antibodies and/or immunities that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-weakened vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the efficacy in vivo of these vaccine candidates in the elderly and their model of letal challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infections remains to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Conversely, the sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as zoonotic sources continue to exist in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The safe and effective development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome due to the long time to develop the vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of a disease prognosis model is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in the ages of 30-65 years with 47.7<0x25> of patients aged over 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care tended to have included comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive care (medium age of 66 years rather than 51 years), indicating age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events are also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to bind to colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that the underlying age and disease are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict the final result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thorax photos and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as supportive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered tremendous stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the early phase of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the initial phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are being made in China, which includes quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of nearly the entire population in hopes of cutting off SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
While these measures are severely damaging to the economy and other sectors within the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conka and throat of patients who had recovered and returned home from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicated that the re-identified virus could be a recurring episode, similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs occur in China, if viewed on the basis of a decline in the number of new cases, suggest that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is expected to cause one million cases with half of deaths.
However, with quarantine and tight isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Perhaps also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a virus that is not too pathogenic that can coexist with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also through direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the stools so it gives rise to the possibility of a new transmission, namely a stool-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defenses that can be used to lower the risk of infection was through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860) helped control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep the saliva splash of a potentially infected person from being air-contaminated or sticking to the surface of the material, where the saliva splash can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series numbers of the 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation by sizes as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions being able to menet fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can menet even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series number 1860s) instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear translucent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home using self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
The distance of three feet is believed to be suitable to keep the distance from the patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low spread properties and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and prevention and prevention of the disease is not a problem.
This message was soothing to the public’s fears, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, that this critical time was late to curb the small-scale illness in Wuhan.
The disease control body in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because every word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to uncommon information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) more restrictive to curb the potential of an epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often issue targeted and effective exercises of the peri to increase public awareness.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak had spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression that the SARS outbreak repeats.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to stem the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than the younger and more about men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than the younger.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91<0x25> compared to 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to curb the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains partly why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Asai RNA routinely to check for SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can give positive results again to the virus examination.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still have to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology found to be 96<0x25> between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What animal is an intermediate species to transmit viruses from the host of origin, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can’t effectively break the transmission and the outbreak can spread back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How do viruses develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become a worldwide pandemic, ending up like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, regardless of the price, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have been driving the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as selesma.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how dangerous and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a highlight again and surprised us with high transmissions, but with a lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis. Therefore, the understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Reservoir mothers intermediaries of several HCoVs have also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of CoV-induced interactions in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and translate the HCoV from the point of view of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful host transition requirements and the implications of viral evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) is from the family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positive, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has similar arrangements.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into polyproteins replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which include protrusions or spikes (S), sheaths or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to certain bloodlines are also encoded by various CoV bloodlines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genuss (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genus, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the stinging of a susceptible patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until an outbreak of SARS occurs.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most damaging outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with rough death rates of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), further called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has already sounded and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all had zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Much of the evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoV adapts well and is nonpathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The zoonotic tracking of HCoV’s origins provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of displacement between species.
The study can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries, and simplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss common topics that the parent HCoV virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after the transmission of interspecies to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV that increased transmission capability is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from stinging patients affected with selesma, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited symptoms of selesma, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and sequenced series pathways in the still breastfeeding brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other pathogenic infections of the respiratory tract such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a period of pain for about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild selesma.
Few patients with weakened immune system indicate severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third found HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super contagious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with a 4 to 7-day incubation period and the peak of the virus load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, lethargy, and shivering, followed by dispnea, cough, and breathing disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lympopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatin kinase are common laboratory disorders in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
In addition, about 20-30<0x25> of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tracts, some organs that include gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be lethal, especially in patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open pulmonary biopsy of zero patient relatives who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, elderly, and weak immune patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Descriptions of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the same virus isolation from an 8-month-old nasal specimen of boys suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and peaks occur in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called a group.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four HCoV communities have fully adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases originated in the Middle East, imports with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far only occurred in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30<0x25> of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death toll of rough cases of 3.4<0x25>.
It should be noted, cases deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2<0x25>, while cases deaths outside of Hubei were 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high homology of the sequence of nucleotides, by 82<0x25>, they both group into different branches of phylogenetic trees.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of the Community HCoV infection, which includes a mild or even nonspecific picture of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions also show interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities with community HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decrease in transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, as are the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like any other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a stool sample.
“Whether the fecal-CoV-2 transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still has to be clarified by subsequent studies.”
Also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
However, the description of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capability, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread in some pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the fate of the final COVID-19 outbreak.
Four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be a species of survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoVs have been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to enable the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in human populations and triggered selesma in immunocompetitive people.
This virus does not require an animal reservoir.
Conversely, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and its transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs of the community.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like a community HCoV, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediary, and simplifying HCoV hosts.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have close related ancestors and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV on a sustainable and long-term basis.
In both cases, the host is infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if the new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate inn can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and plays a host of amplifiers by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have a dead-end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with prey animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that the seller of the animal had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The moonworm (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is backed by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all foxes in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the lunar weasel from the wild or farm that is not exposed to the live animal market largely gives negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that the lunar weasel may only act as a host of intermediate amplifying, but not a natural resorvoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80<0x25> of the various animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as host of SARS-CoV intermediate amplifiers.
All these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV subsequently revealed a closely related bat CoV, called a relative-SARS HKU3 Rhinolopus bat CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horsebacked bats.
These bats gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92<0x25> nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are the host for emerging human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The modified enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of bat stools was shown using ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of convalescent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestral closest associated with SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95<0x25> sequence homology of nucleotides.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct host virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same host receptor, namely dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a pathway to the virus.
The RNA sequence of dependent polymerase MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its match in the beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels provide seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels from the Middle East in some African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is synonymous with the virus found in humans is isolated from the nasal wear of the Arab camel. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms is observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that the infected camel decomposes the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving an unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> of nucleotide homology with RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless a nearly identical bat CoV is found later in life.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts are among the wildlife species sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a group of endangered small mammals, known as trenggiling (Manis javanica), may also carry beta-CoV ancestral associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The new Trenggiling CoV genome shares 85-92<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90<0x25> at the nucleotide sequence level.
The two are grouped into two sub-lines of virus-like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with a similar amino acid sequence of 97.4<0x25>.
Significantly, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the homology rate of the whole genome is higher.
Previous studies on sick trenggiling also reported the detection of contig viruses from pulmonary samples, which turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methods of drafting and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3<0x25> complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of trenggling as one of the host of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from the trenggiling due to the differences in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, trenggiling, and other mammals remains to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest homology at the level of the whole genome sequence.
It is too speculative if it is said that the high level of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the evolution of convergents whose selectivity is mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination occurs widely among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, under the name Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also being its intermediate host.
To be clearer, the current knowledge of the origin of the known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV transmission between species in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species of livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmissions between species is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is an alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may contact bats in shared ecological niches.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E exist diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaka causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaka is not found in ferral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting a relative's alpha-CoV-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alpha-CoV bats serve as a trough of HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and Arab camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the initial identification of the virus and is also reinforced with subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich canyon of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and interspecies transmission.
Long lifespans, close-range colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, are all conditions that support bats to become the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmissions, the role of trenggiling, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmissions is different.
In particular, beta-CoV trenggling is highly pathogenic in trenggling.
Tenggiling may be the final host for the beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, bats could have been a reservoir host for a relative SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, trenggling may be one of the hosts of intermediate amplifiers for the newly-induced SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of prey meat.
It is possible that many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of antibodies to pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that are in contact with both bats and trenggiling.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus side are also important to facilitate CoV across species barriers.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chained RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new host.
CoV has an exoribonuclease corrective, deletion that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV replication through this exorubunuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its host mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutations is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, signaling a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoVs that have adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoV when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the end of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand shifts often occur during transcription of RNA CoV.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can undergo recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence of recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-induced interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another major factor that affects transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the incidence of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolation and weed, SARS-CoV is thought to have undergone rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively the host antibody response target.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its corrective pathway to the virus.
The RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, weasels, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus allowing transmission of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human virus isolation and weed in RBD and 4 of them were located in the receptor binding motive for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV ferrets have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of protrusion protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implies the affinity of binding S proteins to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the affinity of human ACE2 binding and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
Also important to know is whether there are any other corrections that may be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teresetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after an interspecies transmission of its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by dependency factors and other host restrictions.
These differences in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the host's dependence factor and break into the host's restriction factor in order to be successful in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in the area of these important viral-virus interactions still need to be identified and characterized.
Filtration of the whole genome is unbiased to look at the dependence factors and restrictions of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bats' CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat's CoV functions as a drainage of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoding gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in human adaptation because the isolated SARS-CoV relative bat virus was found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports the host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between various lineages are shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in Saudi Arabian camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs are recombined with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes to the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the pressure of the selection experienced, such as by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka indicates single nucleotide insertion resulting in skeletal shifts.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir host.
Symptoms are mild or non-symptomatic when bats are infected with CoV, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in activation of a proinflammatory response in bats will decrease the pathology that CoV triggers efficiently.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats was suppressed due to the increase in regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low histocompatibility primary class I molecule expression levels.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of bats can suppress CoV replication and affect rectification by exoribonuclease so as to put pressure on selection for the creation of highly pathogenic strains of viruses as they enter the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, which results in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret of carriers without symptoms and causes of severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the excessive activation of the immune response as well as cytokine storms, with lung damage getting heavier if the immune response gets stronger.
Conversely, in carriers without symptoms, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding on the relevance of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflamasom in bats is defensive.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflamasom with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also bat coVs that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While foxes and other animals on the market were found to carry the virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A highly homologous beta-CoV trenggiling with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that trenggiling may act as one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV trenggiling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or inadvertently.
CoV was again at the center of attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bats and transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wet wet markets, it may be the wet market closure and the killing of all wet wet weeders in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trenggiling should have been removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV trenggling bloodlines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truths and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through trenggiling and other mammals still need to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arab camels.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be made to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we successfully eliminate this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
Specifically, the potentially zoonotic bat CoV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and undergo recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparations and countermeasures plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until there is an opportunity for spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human chances of contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Sustainable surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoonosis is that humans must keep distance from the ecological niches of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to trenggiling, conditions when bats and trenggiling share ecological niches are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way that the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and trenggiling, should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be carried out.
Whether bats, trengglings, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified at its natural host in the future.
Continuous investigations in this field will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates to the diagnostic criteria of "predictable cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fighting a worldwide pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answer one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "expected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus is named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also constantly being updated.
As an example of the Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with part of the context having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 (the seventh version of the trial) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm suspected cases is required a combination of one of the epidemiological history descriptions with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a class history of travel or living in Wuhan city and its surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive cyclical acid test); (3) contact history with patients who experience fever or respiratory symptoms with the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or elsewhere community
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire viral genome indicates high homogeneity to the new known coronavirus; (3) positive to the lipidated IgM antibody and a specific IgM-positive antibody in the Ig-SA changes to SARS-CoV-2 in the test
We can see that a real-time PCR test of nucleic acid in a sample of respiratory or blood tracts was added to the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added in the fourth editions (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on continuous research by researchers to look for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood retrieval, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of positive results of certain antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a growing amount of evidence that reminds us to be on the lookout for patients with atypical and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and complying with the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of infectious cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured cases living at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Merjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was hospitalized at the Kuwaiti Hospital Maitree.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Obaidul Quader, Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, said public transport would be stopped for longer than originally planned, until Saturday.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded incidence of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, at two people who had just returned home from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia suffered its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Agency reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that there have been more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. due to coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region's quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said Russian citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote in opposition.
Saudi Arabia extends the night hours in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina until the whole day; earlier, the evening hours are only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement the night watch between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the residency order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet paper purchase limits per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday afternoons, the Australian store network of Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also imposed a one-size-fits-all limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on his network's Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly accumulated supplies due to fears of COVID-19 in case the public had to perform self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change follows a limitation of four packs per transaction previously implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles reported that by enforcing the four packet restrictions, "many stores were still out within an hour of delivery", calling the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales were "sharpening sharply" last week, according to one Woolworths spokesman.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered packaging larger than suppliers and increased frequencies of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase supplies, but the restrictions of local government agencies for truck delivery times made it difficult.
He anticipated an increase in production costs, as suppliers sought to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had released supplies earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill in supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue is a large-volume item so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods is increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are a lot of goods on the shelves, if products like toilet wipes and sanitizers can [buy] and exist in large quantities, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman said through the ABC News Agency.
Recycled toilet tissue manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet wipes to the first bidder of the auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held as buyers took a pause for a long Labour Day weekend holiday.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts meant to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Stores were actually reluctant to implement restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report on March 3, they said they did not plan to implement purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, hand washing soaps, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the UK's online supermarket Ocado was observed to limit the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates and mobilizes its people in response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.
We are very concerned both because of the alarming level of spread and severity as well as because of the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to a sustainable global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January, which described the outbreak as an emergency for the rest of the world.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in essence, the outbreak will deteriorate."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a World-Warning Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The fatality rate of cases is estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04<0x25> to 0.08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute shortness of breath syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatments are symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing the mouth while coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring as well as self-isolation for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposeing travel restrictions, quarantine, night hours, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and the breadth of supply of goods aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been xenophobia and discrimination incidents against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people coming from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reductions in travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are largely related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and associated with bat coronavirus, gangiling coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with later symptoms is known to get sick on December 1, 2019, and the person does not have a clear correlation with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial clusters of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reportedly declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases within China
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with people aged 19 and below making up 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. UK's head of scientific advisory, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60<0x25> of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been positively confirmed according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were a source of infection for 79<0x25> of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the infection rate in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not heal, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75<0x25> have preexisting health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The calculation of official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deceased who gave positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figures are likely not to include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, at home in treatment, etc.
Particular data from Italy found that the amount of excess death rates during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID mortality calculation by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement confirmed by a non-scientific report on too low calculations in the U.S. The too low calculations often appear in the pandemic, as in the 2020 H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. The first death confirmed in Wu 9
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded respectively in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, as well as are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and the character of populations such as age, sex, and overall health. The death rate to case reflects the number of deaths divided in the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll to case ratio was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated mortality-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for people with symptoms beginning January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for people with symptomatic onset after February 1, 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects a certain percentage of people diagnosed who died of certain diseases, and the infected fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a certain population ranging from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the overall fatality rate of infections for the pandemic between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The upper limit of this estimate range is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis that analyzed the test's impact on CFR estimates.
The WHO has confirmed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of this outbreak is unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then start to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection right now about when it happened".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argues that "this outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on delays to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that the SRS-CoV-2 "will continue circulating, possibly up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is less likely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal illness, which comes back every year."
Repeat virulence will depend on the immunity of the group and the rate of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and an infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of olfactory power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, shivering, vomiting, hemoptisis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including breathing difficulty, depressed chest or sedentary chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, sepsis and sepsis.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those with close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure they are not infected.
Chinese estimates asymptomatic ratios range from some to 44<0x25>.
The period of incubation (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients losing olfactory power initially 30<0x25>, then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Details about how the disease spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur mainly at close contact times and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that an uncovered cough could cause a pushed droplet of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be able to be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Breathing droplets can also be produced while exhaling, including while speaking, although these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can fall in the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Spreading can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at a further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which signal transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few reports of asymptomatic cases have been lably confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that the infected person may already have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All new features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line of descent B) along with two stripes of bat derivatives.
The virus has a similarity of 96<0x25> at the level of the whole genome with other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the gangiling virus and the human virus.
To date, the comparison of the whole genome found that there was at most 92<0x25> similarity of genetic material between the Tenghilling coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the Tenggiling is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Testing using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, these tests are performed on nasopharyngeal wear, but throat wear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests have proven to be accurate enough to be widely approved for their use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) features in symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glass ground opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlapping with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered a filtering tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutionary neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing tissues while coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or appealed to stop all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a stage of spreading the scale of society in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers dealing with people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for these purposes has sparked privacy concerns, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of users' distance to other mobile phones.
Subsequently, users will receive a message if they are close to someone tested positive for COVID-19.Distributed misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwashing is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This recommendation is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps that damage its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60<0x25> alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71<0x25>, isopropanol 50–100<0x25>, sodium hypochlorite 0.1<0x25>, hydrogen peroxide 0.5<0x25>, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5<0x25>.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the sufferer should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with elbows bent or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and mileage of respiratory droplets spread while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the time and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch the face with insufficient hands, which is a major source of transmission.”
WHO recommends using masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people who treat COVID-19, although the WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already started encouraging the use of masks to members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to a healthy community, especially when adjacent (1 meter (3 ft) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit its people from going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since mid-March, requires intercity train and bus passengers to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the home, as well as recommend the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also called physical restrictions) are infection control measures intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restriction methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments are obliging or demanding social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations is rapidly reduced, ranging from 250 people (if there is no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune system disrupted that have a risk of serious illness and higher complications are advised the CDC to keep as far as possible at home socially in areas that are subject to a physical outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change terms.
The use of the term "social restrictions" implies that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic period.
These recommendations include recommendations to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have any viruses or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend independent quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest independent quarantine instruction is issued for people who belong to the high-risk group.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with the widespread spread of COVID-19 are advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
Strategies in outbreak control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Contemplation is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease across the population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and the public.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be performed at the same time.
Supression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive rate to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is attempting to lower the epidemic peak, known as ramping up the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed with health care and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restriction, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meeting events; community involvement to encourage the increasing acceptance and participation of the entirety of the circumference in this kind of intervention; as well as measures that swell at the environmental level, such as other drasive outbreaks.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass censorship and quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who quarantine independently and impose large fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and penalizes the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak demand for health care by up to 2/3 and death by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Supression can be chosen, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because otherwise the transmission will surge back rapidly as the suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have had an impact on social and economic development.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19 yet, but development efforts are underway, which includes testing existing drugs.
Taking free-sale flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
Some of the previously approved compounds for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO says increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and European regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, separating and isolating positive COVID-19 patients, as well as improving intensive care skills by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patients).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with unknown causes was observed on December 26 and handled by Zhang Jixian doctor at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's Central Hospital told their colleagues about "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued a public announcement on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Quite a number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transport hub and railway transit venue.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Official data further show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest confirmed number of cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and make border controls.
National responses include containment measures, such as quarantine (known as home stay orders, in-place shelter orders, or region quarantine) and night hours. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are in a kind of quarantine region in the United States, more than 50 million people are quarantined territory in the Philippines, about 59 million people are quarantined region in South Africa, and 1, billion people in South Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a region quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest cases on November 17.
Zhang Jixian's doctors observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; this observation was notified of his hospital to the CDC Jianghan on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patients samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine referred to as the "largest quarantine in human history", the cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to halt travel in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Lunar New Year celebration (January 25) has been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was also built thereafter, the Leishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing a health declaration for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holidays.
All universities and schools within the country are closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implemented several steps, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
Steps to work remotely are applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions are imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movement is applied in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) face some sort of offshore restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" viruses from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On 23 March, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had essentially been blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were relaxed in Hubei, aside from Wuhan, two months after the quarantine of the territory was imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on March 26, 2020 that entries for visa holders or residence permits will be suspended from March 28 onwards, without any specific details about the time this policy will expire.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for the company. The State Council announced a mourning day by starting three minutes of national copyright silence on April 4 at 10:00, coincident with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage online with regard to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji adherents who visited Daegu from Wuhan are alleged to have been the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13<0x25> have reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert rate on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers were positively exposed to the virus.
Flight schedules are also affected and changed. South Korea introduces programs that are considered to be the world’s largest and best organized programs to filter viruses in populations, isolate any infected person, and track and quarantine people with whom they are in contact.
Filtering methods include the obligation of self-reporting symptoms by people coming from overseas through mobile apps, lantatural or drive-thru virus testing with results available the following day, and increased testing capability to more than 20,000 people each day.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city. At first, South Korean public views were divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment against President Moon over their claims that the government made a mistake in handling the outbreak, or vice versa, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reportedly had the lowest total of one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all newcomers coming from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for help testing the virus from 121 countries.

Shia places of worship in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.After China, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the rate of outbreaks in Iran is covered up, more than ten countries retreated their cases to Iran on February 28, indicating that the outbreak rate may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
Iran’s parliament closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights defenders detained for peaceful protests and, in the meantime, release all eligible prisoners.
It is stated that there is a greater risk for spread in closed institutions such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number in the country since the start of the outbreak.
As of March 17, there were at least 12 former Iranian politicians or government officials or those in office who died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran faces 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.

It is also said that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country’s financial ability to respond to the outbreak of the virus.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The case began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Then, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to stem the outbreak, which includes a quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the area of the outbreak, people are not allowed to come in.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events has been ordered in the area."On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationally by the time Italy reaches 100 deaths.

A CNN report said that the thing that contributed to the high mortality rate was a combination of a large Italian elderly population and an inability to test all people infected with the virus.
Initially, Britain’s response to the virus was one of the sagging among the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictions or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being deemed less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an appealing announcement to stop all trips and nonessential social contacts and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all recreational places, such as pubs and fitness centers, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of workers' wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions, namely banning meetings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities only to activities that are considered very important.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the fining and dissolution of the group.

WHO noted the differences between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up so as to hamper prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "provided routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On January 23, in reaction to the central government's decision implementing a transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the move was "clearly not a WHO recommendation," but it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to curb the epidemic in place of the epidemic in which the pandemic was most concentrated" and he called it "the first number of epidemics that have never occurred before in the history of public health."
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared “a risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have a qualified health system.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that disrupt international travel and trade unnecessarily" as well as "the WHO does not recommend trade and movement restrictions."
On Feb. 5, the WHO called on the global community to contribute <0x24>675 million to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, while citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have a system to detect people who contract the virus if the outbreak spreads."
Furthermore, Tedros made a statement that "our strength limits are on the weakest chains" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more expensively later in life."In a February 11 press conference, the WHO designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to give "an answer in the form of exertion of the entire force of the UN system".
Then, the United Nations enabled the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which according to the WHO would allow them to "focus on health responses, while other institutions can use their expertise to bear the impact of outbreaks in broader areas of social, economic, and development."
On February 14, a Joint Mission Team with China led by WHO was activated; the team aims to provide international experts and WHO in China in order to help domestic management as well as evaluate "the severity and transmission of disease" by holding a "severe level of disease" by holding a federation-related workshop and pandemic meeting of the country's nationally relevant institutions and to conduct a field visit to assess "the impact of countermeasure activities at the provincial and county levels of the WHO, 25, which include the order.
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent the Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation.

In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency program, warned that, “It’s time for every government on the planet to face the reality: Wake up.
The virus is likely to come to your place and you should be ready," and urges that proper countermeasures can help the world avoid “the worst”.
Ryan further stated that the current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration meant "essentially we accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned about the level of alarming spread and severity, as well as the level of alarming inaction."

A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed regarding the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in handling outbreaks in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected previous recognition of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, and have supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 coming from the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up action gives power to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." These words were eventually criticized by critics as racism and "distracting attention from its government's failure to deal with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government message outlining communication strategies and clearly originated in the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and performing on television."Medias such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a "geo-political component, which includes fighting to gain influence through the distortion of facts and 'politics of generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners."
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and reportedly send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's 100,000 masks for Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

Of course, this is not a sign of good European solidarity.”
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed the Russian army to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use for Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out a “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm attack.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media's reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering aid to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. equipment and medical materials manufacturers get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
The planned "Defender 2020" NATO military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defender exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only puts the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the residents of the country in which they operate."The Iranian government was severely affected by this virus, with about two dozen MPs infected at the time with fifteen political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country is having difficulty fighting outbreaks due to a lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions on Iran. This outbreak has prompted calls to the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, high-level health care, paid family leave, and more funding rates.
Political analysts suspect it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorate due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, South Korea’s public views were divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition, either calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's mistake in dealing with the outbreak, as well as praising its response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule through indefinite edicts, suspend parliament and general elections, as well as punish people who were deemed to spread false information about the virus and crisis handling by the government.
Coronavirus outbreaks are blamed for cases of supply shortages, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to fight out outbreaks, panic-related purchases, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increasing consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Some areas also experience purchasing due to panic that results in a vacancy of basic needs, such as food, toilet wipes, and bottled water, which triggers a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase of prices to twenty-fold in normal prices and triggered a four to six-month delay in supply of medical goods.
It also leads to a shortage of self-protection tools worldwide, and WHO warns that this will harm healthcare workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a scarcity of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
China and Italy’s measures in countering the hoarding and trade of important products are successful so that the anticipated acute food shortages in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks are only found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials remove pork reserves to ensure the public's nutritional adequacy.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which requires food manufacturers to store reserves for emergencies like this.
Global economic deterioration has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to prevent the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5<0x25>.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, virus outbreaks are thought to cause a major destabilization threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic collapse due to the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis said the outbreak had an impact of more than <0x24>300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be “disrupting” after oil prices have dropped sharply due to reduced demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, which included the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained the Negative Outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many people think an economic recession may occur.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency move of the central and state banks on time.
The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most severely affected due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government measures that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to minimal demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping line industry is at an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, a major travel season related to the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the annual Chinese New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities, and Chinese regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong increased countermeasures of infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The retail sector was impacted globally due to reductions in working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50–60<0x25> decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world impose additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to UN Economic Commission estimates for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million compared to situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are displaced at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak can lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32<0x25>. The quarantine of the region in India causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss in March. Nearly area in 2020, 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers filed for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers filed for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany filed for a short-term government subsidized work scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Across the world, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors are greatly affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Organizations of the arts and culture sector seek to uphold their mission (which is often publicly funded) to provide cultural heritage access to the community, maintain the safety of employees and communities, and support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been exerted to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another disadvantageous impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruption. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which fell on the last week of the Fourth Christian Conversion season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online or television live broadcasts, while others offer drive-in or lantatured worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the emptying of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and places of worship were then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events are cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "re-scheduled until after 2020, but not more than summer 2021."Around the world, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This causes many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report significant new registration increases. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or cancelling concert tours.
Many major theatres such as Broadway also delayed all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live-streaming concerts online or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, spread, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distracting amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) noted racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or receive what they claim to be a worthy reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination due to their local origins.
There is already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan became a trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in rates of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and study in major Indian cities have reportedly suffered abuse related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Party President Bharatiya Janata state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong".In China, xenophobia and racism against the non-Chinese population were burning because of the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "exiles".
Many newspapers that use paid restrictions have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made outbreak-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share the results quickly on preprinted servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) respiratory diseases and the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
These tests are specific and are designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus alone.
These tests are used to confirm new or still active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of populations.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The accurate mortality rate of the disease and the immune level of the group in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported fatality rate of cases, which are most likely to be calculated too high in some countries.
Using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal wear or sputum samples.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat slash are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from the deep breathing tract by using a suction catheter or material released through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and forming at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection tool on January 28, 2020.
The device is looking for the "E" gene owned by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based community-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools. In the United States, the Coronavirus Centers for Health Control and Prevention of the Coronavirus (CDC) is the 2019 Coron Coron-C.
One in three genetic tests in the old version test tool gave unsatisfactory results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until then that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to perform testing.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no announced quantity limits; the collection and processing of specimens must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be done within 3.5 hours of high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because it does not require a series of temperature changes, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to new coronavirus proteins (proteins N) are being developed in Taiwan, in hopes of delivering results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A bibliography review published in March 2020 concluded that "thorax photos have small diagnostic values in the early stages, as the findings of CT [computed tomography] may already exist before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current pandemic's origin point showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early filtration.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. An examination can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automatic systems with high yields in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these examinations, but their availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction measures are not required before examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notification to agencies as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test tool that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its testing capacity was up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it was much faster than a conventional PCR examination of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test tools it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong drafted a scheme so that suspected patients could stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a while later. The NHS UK announced that the NHS would be pioneering the test case of a suspected case test in the home so as to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they came to hospital or had to dinfect.
Lantature testing centers have helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest tests compared to any country. On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient order and 10,700 testing had been carried out in the previous week.
The fee is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, lantatural tests were offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany is unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospitals <0xE7><0xB1><0xB1> and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 meters of patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing.
With its construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling suggests that cases in Hubei could be 47<0x25> higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if these testing capacity did not exist.
Wuhan's laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handling.
As of March, inadequate shortages and number of reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers sought to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more population-per-capita coronavirus testing than any other country, and were prepared to increase the scale of testing to reach most of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of lantatural testing and population-scale mass laboratory purchases from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, it is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
Various testing recipes targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop on their own.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, thereby slowing the testing available in the U.S.. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test equipment; both these countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demand and recommendations of healthcare experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing waiting for work in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of usable tools and chemical reagents became precarious.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC had a "disability"; the government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private. Spain purchased the test tool from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may be a result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would pull out equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that this test tool be dumped into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test tool Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they did not "use it".The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test tools from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The testing, followed by a positive-tested person quarantine and tracking people who came in contact with people who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19 deaths in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive have no symptoms, and all cases are found in quarantine.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections were eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, incoming travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing considerably slower than in other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holidays on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territorial quarantine, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality rate, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people who had mild or symptomless symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "<0x25> positive test result" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all their populations, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning a person’s hands that aims to remove dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or selesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning your child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals and before and after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw poultry.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing meals.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce the mortality rate of infants at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased practice of handwashing can slightly increase the growth of high toddlers.
In developing countries, children’s mortality rates due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of the disease by nearly 50<0x25>.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in cases of diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behaviors performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant mortality; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing your hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet into an embedded habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, as well as reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory tract infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small side effect of hand washing is that hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Washing your hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of the disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (washing, urinating), after cleaning the child's ass (replacing diapers), before feeding the child, before meals and before/after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw poul.
Another important time to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent the transmission of the disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7<0x25> of households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate by 97 percent; the United States was nearly in the middle by 77 percent; and China at the lowest level of emerging children with 23 percent. Now available some behavioral change methodologies to improve the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soaptions of students at the critical times.
The Foundational Health Care Program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate measures to support the health and education of children.
Giving worm medicine twice a year, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soaps or detergents to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic dirt, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleaning of fats and proteins is assisted by adequate water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that examined the removal of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that transfers were unlikely to occur because the bacteria were squeezed with foam.
However, the CDC maintained that "liquid soaps whose discharge from hands-free containers are preferred."
Antibacterial soap is widely recommended to health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resilient strains of organisms.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soap, these soaps may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mentholes, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the abdomens of the abdominals and bacterials contain the same amount of soap.
Comfortable warm water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm water soap is more effective compared to cold soapy water in removing natural oils that hold dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to the belief of many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand hygiene or hand antiseptics are non-water-based hygiene agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents of water-based alcoholic scrubbers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels or together humectants such as glycerin into liquids or foams to be easy to use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand hygiene containing at least 60-95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Rubber alcohol hygiene kills bacteria, many drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol hygiene containing 70<0x25> alcohol kills 99.97<0x25> (log reduction 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> to 99.999<0x25> (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in hands 1 minute after use. Hand hygiene is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand hygiene is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol scrubbers in adequate amounts should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and tip of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
Fingertips should also be properly washed by rubbing them in two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitation rubs, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increased use of sanitation agents due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitation agents should not be used as a proper replacement for hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can often cause dry skin, unless the skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains emollients causes skin irritation and drought much lower than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcoholic hand rubbing are rare.
A lower tendency leads to disruptive contact dermatitis being the attraction of this product rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still in the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, the product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol-friendly rubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, perhaps due to a progressive reaction to side effects.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Dust or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for disease transmission prevention include the following measures:
Wet your hands with warm or cold water that flows.
Flowing water is recommended because the soaked basin may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature does not appear to have any effect.
Brush your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Brush for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer removes more germs.
Rinse carefully under flowing water.
Rinseing in the basin can make the hands contaminated again.
Dry it with a dry lap or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-contaminated. The areas that are often missed are the thumbs, wrists, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and exfoliated nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturized lotions are often recommended to keep your hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, drain water from jerigen or bottles hung and dug and/or use ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are other water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hung with a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a shaft of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more research suggests that paper laps are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper lap industry of the European Tissue Symposium, to compare paper lap hygiene levels, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194<0x25> in the fingerbooks and 254<0x25> in the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet air dryer led to an average 42<0x25> increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingerbooks and 15<0x25> in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with paper laps, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76<0x25> in the fingerbooks and 77<0x25> in the palm.Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air from the unit at a speed claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially pollute other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The paper lap showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers manufacturing, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper laps.
Washing your hands using hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative when traveling if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to cover and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed with each other with fingers attached to each other.
If there is dirt under the nail, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water that is in the hand, the hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with a clean lap.
After drying, paper laps are used to turn off the water faucet (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care order is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("weeds") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so it transmits microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could lower the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the standards of hand washing and hand rub in the health care sector.
WHO’s hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public commentary.
Relevant reviews were conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Hours" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before the aesthetic, and
After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "drugs" or "antimycrobials") serves to kill handwashing materials.
Such killing functions may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To 'brush' hands before surgical surgery, it is necessary a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidin or iodine wash, a sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub as well as other steril instruments to clean the bottom.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure requires washing your hands and lower arms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long scratch time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After finishing hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling the sick.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20<0x25> of washing, and that the additional benefits gained were very few when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap resulted in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food than washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand rubbers reduced bacterial contamination by 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubbers to reduce the A H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare order can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubbers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various healthcare arrangements.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in residential homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing faucets near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although there are options to make cheap hand washrooms.
However, low levels of hand washing can also occur due to habits that have been embedded and not due to lack of soap or water.
The stimulus and encouragement of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to be effective, supervision and evaluation is required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of handwashing promotion at school was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three stars.
Building a handwashing place can be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce illness and death of children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that attempts to achieve behavioral change goals. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emojis.
Some studies examine the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoiding Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost from illness.
One review showed that promoting hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and health-related infections made the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, a poster of “correct hand washing techniques” was hung next to a hand washing sink in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands from" means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or be involved in something.
The expression comes from the biblical chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to cleanse the imaginary stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after recalling or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after the meditation had a smaller poverty involved in compensatory measures that "clean", such as volunteering.
Religion orders hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual part of hand washing in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and yadayim netilate in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders hand washing for hygiene, especially after
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of work safety and health methodologies for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the workplace and job tasks, which are based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, it is recommended basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Exposure-risk jobs include jobs requiring close or frequent contact with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in the ongoing community or international travel.
The group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population work environments, and high-volume retail order.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection tools when meeting COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues exposed to people who are known to or suspected to have COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include controlling techniques, such as negative pressured ventilation chambers, and self-protection tools that fit the job tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns may change, either in terms of the type of item requested or the way of obtaining these items (such as shopping outside of rush hour, by shipment, or lantatur).
Finally, shipments of goods from highly affected geographic regions of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Preparedness and infectious disease countermeasures plans can be used to guide protection measures.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and plan for the treatment of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The outbreak's countermeasures include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the countermeasures taken.
A hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in work safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
If the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and lastly self-protection tools.
Technical control includes isolating employees from job-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to apply.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Self-protection tools (APDs) are considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APD should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly charged, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent handshakes, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing tissues and trash containers, preparing work remotely or work turn with gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and supplies routinely, and doing cleaning and disinfection work.
Quick identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory illnesses stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-lowering drugs or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that the disease leave policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and to get employees to know this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure-risk jobs are currently covering jobs requiring close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because a new person travels internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
The workman's intervention of the workman's intervention of the workman's intervention to the public, the work environment with high population density, and the retail order of high volume. Controlling techniques for this group and high-risk groups includes installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneeze, and installing a drive-thru or lantatur window for customer service, Administrative controlling for this group and group.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear medical gloves once-used when caring for sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other self-protection devices if the sick passenger has fever, constant coughing, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in bio hazard pockets, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial cruises, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, danger control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating themselves, and informing a medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabin of an isolated person. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is transmission in society at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large societies, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating at a cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to social restriction strategies, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and task equipment before reuse using a household cleaning spray or lap and follow standard surgical procedures to control and remove the used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare workers and morgues to be in the category of high or very high exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes at very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, known or suspected patients COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, multiple procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive specimens.
The work of the morgue is at high risk of exposure includes workers involved in preparing the dead bodies of known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes at very high risk of exposure if the worker conducts an autopsy. The control of additional techniques for this risk group includes isolation space for a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, including when an aerosol-producing procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and morgue arrangements.
Specimens must be dealt with with precautions of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come are separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of a known or suspected patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform the aerosol-producing procedure.
In the United States, N95 or better approved NIOSH face covering respirator should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothes or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at the entry point.
For people taking breathing specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing APD needs through long-distance medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct care can enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD without the necessary symptoms for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirator and removing the same APD while treating many patients with him.

SUBJECT BARIS: [Covid-19] Relieve the burden and prepare for the future
TANGGAL/TIME OF SERVICE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENCE: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human interconnection and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the building of a global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we have witnessed among all our co-workers through email, calls and chats is a remarkable validation of the existence of extraordinary humans, whom we are lucky enough to work with.
My infinite gratitude and pride can call you co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work enables this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays running, helps pay our colleagues, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, especially today.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met overnight to discuss our approaches and schedules for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain organizational continuity during this time.
We are eager to relieve pressure and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your work time.
If you’re sick, don’t work.
It shouldn’t have to be said, but we said it.
A sick leave or PTO is not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise your calendar and schedule to make sure the major areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Companies whose hour-based wages will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it once again, in honor of our commitment to contractors and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when normal circumstances.
This includes if you’re sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress on the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep going.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust <0x26> Security, as well as Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There’s a lot to do for all of us, we’ll only focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down the present will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan to "overwork catch up" after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines at the moment.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to create a budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on less schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update delegates and teams in the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to extreme concern, we employed an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in San Francisco offices.
They use hospital-class antivirus fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety ensuring protocols by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full distance work order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our longtime long-time long-time long-time colleagues realize that it may need adjustments and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting for at least an hour or two.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Define meetings clearly, create an agenda, and send previous reading material.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting note (or make a collaborative note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small meals.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared jobs
The HR Operations Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased jobs distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make them unlikely to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be penalized for having to postpone or modify those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be the grief of this disruption, but at the same time relief of clarity and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is working on setting up pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor their impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the upcoming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that might require help, feel free to let you know and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of Human Rights.
None of these changes are seen as neglecting our work and obligations.
Instead, this change is a recognition that, at the moment, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done before.
These changes are measures that we believe are important to support each other in these situations so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movements need, and provide the world of services they rely on.
The work we planned earlier will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the coming weeks and maybe the next few months.
We need all of you to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work the best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby).
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) in the pulmonary, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite to the angiotensin-converter enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a terminal-N M2 peptidase domain and a terminal-C amino acid renal collectrin transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single passing membrane protein, with enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and plain muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of a neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins on the spike or protrusion of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosoms located within the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires priming the protein S by serin protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may be able to help combat infections.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34<0x25> decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
“The use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less powerful compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant humans (rhACE2) are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appear to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipoplysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work in addition to the length of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. The infusion of rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of the app's users.
Alternatives that do not infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based app directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an application that allows citizens to check if they have contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still waiting for approval of the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking apps are in advanced development stages and will be available to be deployed within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; these applications are designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if the data the application retrieves is limited to a small percentage of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, i.e. limiting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon are implementing similar restrictions.
Proponents of privacy have voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly as to whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be halted after the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary, and proportionate";
Expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
The use of data should be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device’s operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunications (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using custom applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the location information available to the public, which was allowed with extensive changes to the information privacy laws after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a centralized system as well as a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Proximity Tracking that Protects Decentralized Privacy (DPPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Numbers, CEN), Protocols and Sensions
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or groove intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share locations and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of those data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a much overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made BlueTrace protocols used by its official government apps open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launch of tools to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address the problem of continuous data capture and surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also called giving new goals, new profiles, or new tasks on medications or therapeutic transitions) is the use of drugs that have been approved for new treatment purposes, namely for diseases or medical conditions that differ with the initial purpose of drug development.
It is a scientific research pathway currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of the drug, each protein has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed its skeletal resemblance to an approved drug and had the highest exposure to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in its preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the associated chloroquine and hydrochlorocokine were two of the four drugs to be studied as part of a Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that chloroquin and hydrochlorocokin trials in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxycholoroquin sulfate and chloroquine phosphate based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized based on the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in inpatient patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxycholoroquin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they were using the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquin combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting safety tests and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxyclorokuin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a 4-day median, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that there is little evidence to support the drug and it is too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. This drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has been multiplicated.
This medication may not be safe if it is used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against some filo-, pneumo-, paramicso-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause disease and more severe transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and another for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for inpatient people and severe COVID-19 illnesses, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of presymtomatic new coronavirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, Phase II trials are ongoing with 200 patients being recruited from severe cases of hospitalization in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colkicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so there was no need for hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients so it encourages the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentered study on 300 patients that examined the use of sodium enokosaparin on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much of the scientific attention is focused on providing new treatment goals on approved antiviral drugs and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th edition guidelines
Some of the antibiotics identified are potentially drugs that can be given new goals for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet to complete clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Large outbreaks spread around the world by 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genome to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative said in April that the things to be considered in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on a required scale, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advance to Phase I security studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials conducted early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomized, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, while determining a more appropriate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involved more participants, including control groups, and tested the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates being actively developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (still in "practical" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamping vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they are beginning to develop vaccines, with human testing targets in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were beginning to develop the vaccine.
Janssen worked with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with a similar technology to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were starting a vaccine project to make the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce vaccine candidates that can be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
Further, the partnership announced the preclinical testing and clinical trials plan of Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolations, and even on a fast track, development of vaccines took at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Candidates of this vaccine are in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "a large sum of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get preclinical testing results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stages can begin testing in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US<0x24>4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reaching US<0x24>29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine that can self-implify for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a fund of C<0x24>275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C<0x24>192 million fund to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, on mice; they stated that "the MNA that gave the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine gave rise to a specific antibody response of potent antigens [in mice] that began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, Waterloo University's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of DNA-based vaccine candidates as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A further randomized trial in Australia sought to include 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, showed the need for containment measures to reach the level of biological safety in handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there has not been a vaccine or protective drug for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, a proven vaccine for MERS has not yet existed.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in process, all of which are virus-vector vaccines, two adenovirus-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts echo conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases cause mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail compound organs.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between humans when it comes to close contact, often through sparks or small droplets generated through coughing, sneezing, or while speaking.
Although produced when exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharynx wear.
The use of the mask is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and people who treat it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or congestion in the chest that is persistent, confusion, difficulty waking up, and facial or bluish lips; immediate medical treatment is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Top breathing symptoms, such as sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat, can be seen, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitation.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
This time is called the period of incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of symptomatic people will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomatic carriers in the transmission is not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is unknown and are being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain symptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began to include symptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1, out of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78<0x25>) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large-scale load of viruses.
Speaking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that is not covered can cause droplets pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although these viruses are not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cartons, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products decompose the layer of virus-protecting fat, deactivate the virus, and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in a median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral charge, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral charge on the second day of testing.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All new features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the associated coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the enzyme modifier angiotensin 2 (ACE2), the most abundant in pulmonary type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or protrusion" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries are found in 12<0x25> of infected people who are hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
The level of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) are found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with monocyte recruitment that secretes IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported on autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of the polymerase chain of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal wear; however, nasal wear or sputum samples can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) independently to detect infections by these viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected previously) are in development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with the testing showed its accuracy was only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely found early in the infection.
Subpleural dominance, insane paving (lobular septum thickening with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can arise as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings in the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of many core giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory fatigue syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: the arrangement of exudates in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation of diminate (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Appropriate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from cloth in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large-scale meetings in public places.
The restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since vaccines are anticipated to not exist until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is attempting to reduce the epidemic peak, known as “a flattening the curve”.
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after penetrating their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60<0x25> alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizer is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with support treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Self-hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with inpatient COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care experts and pulmonary experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into free resources, namely the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminofen) more than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Air Tular-Infected Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of self-protecting devices (APD) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD robes, respirators or facial masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not facial masks) are better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized this mask for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The N95 respirator is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but its effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too severe until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed severe.
Types of respiratory support for people experiencing COVID-19-related respiratory failure are being actively researched for people being hospitalized, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal canal or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods resulted in the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal canulas. Heavy cases are more common in the elderly (people over the age of 60, and especially people over the age of 80).
Many developed countries do not have adequate per capita hospital beds, which limit the health system’s capacity to handle a sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases that is severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> entered in intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators capable of performing pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available in old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take some time until 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral medications can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO's recommended volunteers participate in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA has given temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in case a person's life is very or instantly threatened.
The convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contacts' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risks of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local healthcare workers. Madagascar analytics on mobile data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The move was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed aggregate phone location data to the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by mobile operators that "40<0x25> of residents still continue to move around".
The German government performed a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience pressure from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic deterioration are perfect storms that jeopardize people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can be mild with few or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as a cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In people most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory fatigue syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clot disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6<0x25> of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4<0x25> of this group.
About 20-30<0x25> of people with a COVID-19 picture show increased liver enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median seven-day period between hospitalization and death.
In a study that examined early cases, the median time ranging from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8<0x25> mortality rate, while women had a 1.7<0x25> mortality rate.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromicsoid exudates in both lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
The pulmonary image resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased levels of troponin or cardiac stop.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of inpatients have an innate condition. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality of the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of mild case counting can cause the death toll to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that took place in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and pulmonary scanning showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely to be acquired, if looking at the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 cured followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a deteriorating residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated from animals, through infections that spread.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of origin of the earliest symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, as well as are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of populations such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The death rate of cases reflects the number of deaths divided by number of diagnosed cases within a specified interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll to case ratio was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a certain disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a certain disease.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a certain population ranging from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7<0x25>) were dead.
At Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and the probability of not all COVID-19 deaths was classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3<0x25> of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confiscated died of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates differ for both men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between new men and women not appearing at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women was 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender-based difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunologic differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected people are men and 72<0x25> of those who die from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of women's sex workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, these viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines calling for not using the location name in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal wear and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and suppliers could not provide in the required time scale, a local company engineered backwards and printed 100 required valves overnight.
After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged regarding origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effects of the treatment of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV were used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helped the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies should be tested to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. An increase in dependent antibody has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials in progress as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxycholoroquine or chloroquine.
The new goal-given antiviral drugs make up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with reporting deadlines at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates already exists.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which includes remdesivir, chloroquin and hydroxyclorocokin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China, and Italy. Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with early results.
However, there is a call for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommends the use of chloroquin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is twice as dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxycholoroquin and chloroquine at the policy of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming against protrusion proteins by serin protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquin and hydroxycholoroquin with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in advanced severe COVID-19 stages.
There is evidence that hydroxylocloroquin may have anticytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study is completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 nonrack tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence showing that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring the purified and tightened antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccinated passive immunization method.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of work expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that relies on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, are in development.
The production of convalescent serums, which are fluid parts of the blood of patients who have been cured and contain specific antibodies against the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
