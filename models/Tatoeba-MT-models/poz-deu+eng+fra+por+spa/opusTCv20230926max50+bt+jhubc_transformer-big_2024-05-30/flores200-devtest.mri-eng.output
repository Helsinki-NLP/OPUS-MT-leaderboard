When a small group of living things (a small number) is separated from a large number of them (such as if they were to have moved more than some other surfaces from a river or to have crossed into an island where it is difficult to return) it usually comes to an environment that is different from what they know.
This new environment has different resources, different competitors, so the new population must have different features or different situations to be able to be strong competitors than those that are needed in the past.
The population does not have to be limited, and it must continue to follow the previous trends.
However, at the beginning of the new generation, the population is becoming less populated than the rest of the population.
