Welsh AM scare 'looking muppets'
There is a growing fear of some AM in the proposal to change their title and make MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It is part of a plan to change the name of the assembly and make it Welsh Parliament.
People from all walks of life are afraid they can make fun of it.
From an AM from Labour, their group is concerned that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers not from Wales: In Welsh, twp and tae mean pwp are stupid.
An AM from Plaid said the group was "unhappy" in general and that they had proposed exchanges.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open in mind" to change names, but also said MWP was not far from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of letter w in Welsh and letter u in Yorkshire English is the same.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently planning to change its name: "Any final decision depends on what the Assembly Members will call upon the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received broad support to call the assembly Welsh Parliament.
As far as AM is concerned, the Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultation.
The AMs are offering possible exchanges, but Presidential Officer Elin Jones could hurt the head of everyone, who is expected to file a bill in just a few weeks.
The child in the reforms will include other changes in the running of the assembly, including the AM disqualification rules and the design of the committee system.
AMs are the last vote on what should be called upon them when they debate the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
There will be a vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name and be called "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will be held in a desire to be resolved for decades when it is disputed next to Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that they own its territory and that Athens has repeatedly objected to its claim of membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who denounces the plebiscite for renaming, refused to respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have only changed their name to be part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Eyes Silent as the Churches of Harlem Suffer
"Once upon a time, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's nothing."
He said the loss of the bars is understandable.
"People are different nowadays," he said.
"The town is no longer the fault of the bars where people go all the time."
For the churches, he fears that it will not last as long as the leaders expect the money to be obtained from the sale of the property, "then they will return to where they started."
He added that condominiums can be replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who can't help the rest of the community sanctuary.
"A lot of white people buy condominiums in these buildings," he said, "so that it will only accelerate the arrival of the day when these churches will be shut down because the people who live in these condominiums will be far away from them."
White congregations built the same church before the black metropolis became the Harlem - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black worshipper congregation near the building took its title.
The black congregation settled St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shoppers at 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the reception or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers were making plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, called the carillon "the misfortunes of the poor."
The player who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural virtue" and "an irreplaceable and wasteful instrument."
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan is the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in these last months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were introduced by the unordered church leaders and others were introduced by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry wrote to the diocese in July - the ruler of the parish, consisting of unordinated leaders - about the concern of "transferring the expenses" of the diocese to the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the acceptance of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old man hunts for lobster in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, he spent half an hour diving on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a boy begging for help and approached him with his group to pull him out of the water.
Ari Hammel, she thought she was just longing for the lobster's catch, but "I realized the boy was screaming, 'I'm biting!
I've been biting!"
"It's all over the place," Hamilton said as he approached the boy.
"I screamed at all the swamps in the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The child was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed in critical condition.
It is unclear what kind of attack is responsible for.
Hari lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a press conference, there was a shark in the area a few weeks ago but it was not identified as a dangerous shark type.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed the coastal access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the department store style with specialist assistants.
As an integral part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and clothing markets fall, it will try bigger beauty islands in 11 stores nationwide, and will increase next year if it will succeed.
Beauty investment is rising as supermarkets look for a way to fill shelf spaces previously used for TVs, microwave, and home appliances.
According to Sainsbury's, they will double the size of their beauty sales by up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also reintroduce its Boutique makeup products to favor vegans most of what it sells - something that a growing younger consumer demands.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will try to sell at two Sainsbury's perfumes stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming year.
Online shopping and shopping for small meals every day in local convenience stores have led supermarkets to make more effort to encourage people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will make outlets more like department stores as the supermarket chain fights discounts such as Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered some Habitat since they bought the same chain two years ago, which according to them has contributed to increased grocery sales and led to increased revenues of purchased companies.
The supermarket's last attempt to change their beauty and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
A partnership of Sainsbury's with Boots was attempted in the early 2000s, but it ceased after an argument on how to divide revenue from its chemist stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy originated after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds plays a role in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We changed the look and look of our beauty islands to enhance the surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in colleagues who have special training and are willing to give advice.
Our brands are designed to meet every need, and the attractive surrounding and convenient locations mean that we are the people's leading destination for enhancement that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones has withdrawn from TV presenter Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with her business lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for Truly, their home appliance brand and accessories.
The company's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow is similar to that of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram his departure from the business.
Holly Willoughby, the Dragons Den star Peter Jones, has been hit by a sudden retreat from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on her bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "enraged" when the TV's golden girl admitted to a passionate meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of their massive business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that there was no time for the Truth, their home appliance brand and accessories.
This business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million resource.
When Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Reality, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
According to one source, "Today, Holly's really top priority is Holly's.
It would be his long-term future that will pass him over the next decade.
Everyone was shocked at his retreat.
No one can believe what's happening on Tuesday, even if it's too close to the opening.
There is a warehouse full of products in Marlow HQ ready for sale."
Experts believe that the company will lose millions of dollars to the departure of the performer of This Morning, one of Britain's most lucrative personalities, resulting in large investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing and household utensils, and those that could be delayed in its inauguration.
And it can serve as an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children were ten years closer to Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of the property in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity by ITV.
A spokesperson for Jones said, "We will not comment on his business issues."
"We're talking and then we're friends."
He joked about the criticisms he could receive from the news media for comments that could be "presidential" and for being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's reaction to the voice of the "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He promised Kim interest in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June that Trump challenged as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, denuclearization has been delayed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was unable to see "equal action" from the U.S. in what they are doing.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to restrict the imposition of the ban.
Trump had a more positive view of his speech at the rally.
"We are in a very good position in North Korea," he said.
"We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had resulted in positive results - stopping rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to stand up like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is homeless, there is no national emergency, a prerequisite for foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, on many occasions, they have made it clear that they are not asking for help abroad, so it is a bit difficult," he said.
While the team is building a team to go to Palu, it is still unclear if the foreigner can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster bureau, Indonesian officials are still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international bureaus will be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, they are not yet ready for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly seen in other coastal areas.
The absence of the siren of the Palu tsunami warning, although there has been a warning, is also likely to have reduced lives.
In the best times, travel between Indonesian islands is tested.
Natural Disasters are intensifying logistics.
An optional ship stationed in Lombok to treat victims of the quake is currently heading for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's strongest infrastructure in his election campaign, and has already provided a lot of money on roads and rails.
But the lack of funds plagued Mr. Joko's administration due to his impending re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also faced with a referendum from the remaining sects in Indonesia, where most Muslims embrace a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets with maquettes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea when he scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
<0x58>herdan Shaqiri scored Sturridge about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team went 1-0.
He turned the ball to the left before kicking into the goal post.
The ball flies at the height of the box and it flies at the top right corner of the net.
Later, the ball fell to the net behind the floating Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It's just in the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always try to play forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to take all the time I get," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanye coming, so I did a kick-off and I didn't think too much about it and I just kept pushing the tide."
Chelsea are leading 1-0 in halftime after finishing 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker pushed the ball back to Matthew Kovacic, before he went to the midfield and slid off to the Liverpool side in the field.
Kovacic gave-and-go quickly to the midfield.
He went through the ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard faced the defense and stayed on his left foot with the net of the far post just past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster bureau on Sunday.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament's latest memorial targeted by the fight for 'historic change'
It was an illustrative justice for its Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts practiced by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "planning to change history."
Ani John Goldsmith, ruler of the Cromwell Society: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's image would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or practice the destruction of sacred images during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake was to be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas had done in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's great invention of Cromwell's 19th-century opinion and part of the study of the history of a person many believe remains to be celebrated.
G Goldsmith's work in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against foreign dictatorship, in his case of course, the monarchy.
It remains the content of the historical debate as to whether it is accurate description in general.
It is only certain that the struggle of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent formation of our country, and that Cromwell was a unique figure representing an aspect of that division.
It is also worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as the Lord's Protector."
Pig Killer Surrounds Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," who was dead and had a severed artery, was bleeding near a pig cage in a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig keeper is preparing to inject a pig vaccine in a bamboo on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found an open door in a nearby pork cage.
He said there was a large man with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that 550 pounds of pig had been swallowed by farmers, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs are doubled and fractured," among them his cousin, who is known only by his surname "Wu," in the Guiyang Evening News.
The video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan and his cousin did not belong to the animal that killed the man.
A market manager in the Evening News said the pig had been detained so that it could not be attacked, as police gathered evidence in the area.
According to the report, there was negotiations between Yuan's family and market authorities for the payment of his death.
Although rare, there have been cases previously recorded by pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig clung to Welsh farmers in his tractor until his wife threatened the animal away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but may serve as a "spur" to them.
"They're just playing.
They like to be overweight, overweight, but they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's surviving strength will bring extensive and rapid rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it heads to the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rain throughout northern Mexico and southwestern the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa, which is a Category 1 Hurricane, had a windshield of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was measured 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a trough on the surface of the Pacific Ocean and it moves east to the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it starts pushing tropical humidity northwards to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will mix in the forthcoming trough of extensive and heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
In the locality, dangerous flooding, debris flows, and landslides in the desert will cause 1 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
A sudden flood with rapid aggravation of conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Canyons can become streams because of heavy rains, and thunderstorms can bring local strong winds and dust blowing.
Nearby depression will bring local heavy rains to some parts of the South California coast.
Prevention is possible to reach a total of more than half an inch, which can cause a slight flow of debris and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the region during its rainy season.
Several tropical rainfalls will begin arriving in Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday nights.
Heavy rains spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, sharp changes in temperatures throughout the U.S. will occur in October, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
At times, it causes severe changes in temperature at close distances.
There is a good example of severe differences in temperatures throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between the cities of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of summer will be tested to strengthen and expand again.
It is expected to have a hot start in October with a wide range of central and eastern U.S. sizes, from the Southern Plains to some parts of the North East.
New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees higher in practice.
Our long-term weather report states a high likelihood of higher than usual temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched staggering testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a weekly investigation of the cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had beaten him drunk and tried to strip him of a high school party.
In a warm statement, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that wasn't the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company counts the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that released it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people watching in offices.
To be clearer, it corresponds to the number of viewers of the football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel led the networks, where opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's commitment, with approximately 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 1.3 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a major figure in Friday's drama.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS caught him on Friday morning screaming by protesters as they boarded an elevator to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes low as he insulted him for several minutes, and threw it out live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," a woman said.
"You think he's telling the truth?
He said, "You have power while many women have no power."
Before the elevator shut down, Flake said his office issued a statement, which in the hearing of the committee he would say more.
It was reported live hours after all cables and broadcast networks, while the Judiciary Committee had to push forward Kavanaugh's nominee throughout the Senate to vote for it.
But Flake said he would only do so because he understands that the FBI will be investigating charges against the nominee next week, which is being pushed by minority Democrats.
Flake was somewhat convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many more senators, Flake formed a decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was clear that Republican votes would not reach Kavanaugh's approval without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses "politician" of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and smashing the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to May on the newspaper's front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's unresponsive Chequers plan for Brexit, he said the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "stupid nonsense."
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his fight mirror.
Police got the mirror on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA here, reports WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's questioning, the police said he admitted to the shooting with Wayde.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, The Advocate reported.
The Office of the Coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to it, the cause of death was a head shot that penetrated the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the crime lab of the state police, Southern University police and local residents in assisting the investigation that was pushed into the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law students for its "effort and search for justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
Baton Rouge grew up in the 6-foot-6 forward, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "stunned" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you always remember," said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City
The popocatepetl volcano has reached homes in the south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after increasing crater activity and registering 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of know-how and vibrations.
Images on social media show thin ash covering car windshields in places in Mexico city such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital following a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash against separatists in Catalan before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with pro-independence protesters against the police, and as thousands joined the opposition action to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's provocative vote in the clash.
Eggs and powder paint by a group of pro-separatists masked pro-separatist police officers stopped them, and it made black clouds of dust on the streets that were usually full of tourists.
In the evening, the police were also in a state of confusion and used firearms to control the conflict.
For hours pro-independence groups have called for "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" in front of unionists protesting shouting, "Spain lives."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries recovered in the protests, local newspaper reported.
Tensions remain high in the region calling for independence after a year of referendum on October 1 that Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of the voters voted independently, although few voted because most of the contestants voted for the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at police stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent action supporting the national police.
The move continued, but was forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer relied on the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year, we had one of our greatest moments.
I saw my parents crying because they were voting but we didn't grow up right now," he said.
Despite the high-profile victory in last December's regional elections, pro-independence parties in Catalan have found it difficult this year because of self-exile or detention and awaiting hearings from many of their prominent leaders for their role in organizing the referendum and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on her phone a protest supporting the police, which politicians of both sides blamed the conflict.
"It's just getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn the retreat of democratic principles and controls we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's Torre, defeating Livingston against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's success
Livingston surprised Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second win in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tie was needed for Gary Holt's team to equalize Hiberian in the second.
Gerrard's team remain undefeated in the Premiership this season and will face the top Hearts who score them eight points, next Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers would face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended their non-thirty division play in six games, with head coach Holt who hasn't lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost a chance against Brussels visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they were scored, if not for their directness causing problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way past, but tried to get a goal, and Alan Lithgow's tent was removed because Craig Halkett's header met him.
The hosts were happy to play Rangers in front of them, knowing they could torture the visitors at the appointed points.
That's how important the goal came.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and got Livingston an opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to support Menga, who got the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had already got the ball but they had difficulty getting into the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a little bit of trouble.
This game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow stayed away from Livingston's other set play.
There have been steadily moves on the side of Livingston and also continued to be pushed away, as two penalties - after Halkett challenged substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were ignored.
"Wonderful" from Livingston - Review
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing play and results for Livingston.
In a person, they are good, they continue to exceed expectations of upward development.
Their playing style and character hasn't changed much since they became the best again, but Holt has been a great compliment for his motivation to the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, leading the organized defense, as Menga tortured Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
The Rangers, however, failed to provide inspiration.
Regardless of what they came from under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
Their last ball failed - only once they opened their side - and it seemed like a call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdogan's reaction to Cologne's
There were smiles and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They argued about human rights issues, freedom of the press, and Turkey's ascent to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
In this city it is the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police have demanded security to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - also called for Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
Two different protests mirrored the divided visitors who were considered the heroes of some German Turks and greeted as dictators of others.
Trail on Deptford road: A cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died after a car crashed in London.
The collision took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped driving and paramedics arrived, but the man died in the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said they were already working on knowing the identity of the man and letting go of his relatives.
Road closures and bus routes were placed and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials have been wounded in riot at the men's high security detention facility, the Prison Office said.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and it is currently continuing.
Specialists "Tornado" officers were sent to deal with the riot, hooking up eight prisoners and keeping on one wing.
Officials were treated in the scene for minor facial injuries.
The Prison Service spokesman said: "There are sent specially trained personnel to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff were treated for the injuries.
We don't allow space for violence in our police stations, and we make it clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and could be held longer."
There are over 500 detainees in HMP Long Lartin, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the policeman had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, officials were called to the prison to address a serious riot in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Sudden Flood in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Drought Areas Can Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare for Arizona, but that can happen early next week because of the surge in the Desert Southwest, which carries the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service for Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona has released flooding tracking to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it is approaching on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "just ten tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with tens of volumes up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
The rest of the Desert Southwest area is likely to get 1 to 2 inches (1 to 2 inches) along with the central Rockies and the Great Basin, which is likely to have a total of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rain can be a blessing because the region dries up.
While it is important to remember the flooding, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because it is currently experiencing drought in the Southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 40 percent of Arizona experiences severe droughts, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa was first to land in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
With the storm still strong and the fastest winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific and at the same time weakens.
So it is expected to land in Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall can be severe in some parts of Mexico, bringing with it a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected in Baja California as far north as western Sonora, which is likely to reach 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa then travels to Mexico as a tropical cyclone before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which then passes through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected in Rosa or on its lip is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and debris flowing in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder, after a 16-year-old with stabs was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was seen wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon area, the Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who had a footage of what had happened on the phone to show up.
"Kavanaugh is 'hardened' by the brutality, by the anger of the Democratic Party," Trump said
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the violent and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "hardened" by the Democratic Party's "hardness, anger" in the process of his nominee.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, insisting and emotionally rejecting the charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she had raped him decades ago, as a teenager.
Ford also testified to hearing about his allegations.
The President said on Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's origin and quality and courage that day."
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most effective brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a mechanical history of public service," he said at a gathering of supporters in West Virginia.
Kavanaugh's nomination was cited in a speech about the cost of the Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
"It's only been five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm really going to run," he said.
"Wherever I am, I'm fighting a good candidate."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was "to fight and stop."
The Senate's first major procedural vote in Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be carried out by no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, as expected to rise
Approximately 384 people were killed, mostly swept away by giant beach waves, when it crashed and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when the surge of up to six metres (18 feet) at noon, with most of their deaths ruining all its passages.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach and did not immediately leave and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Not going without the tsunami, it dragged cars, houses, it hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach.
Trees climbed others to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs showed that the disaster agency released many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the city on the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have been affected by earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technolog (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bombs deployed in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city's geography, positioned at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have strengthened the tsunami's strength, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of other victims were seen stranded under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and injuries could be higher along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a place called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication was "completely cut without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can still get worse," he said.
Criticism to the agency was widespread on Saturday because they did not say that there was a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building screaming fears of approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a water wall struck the beach, taking off buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive power losses that cut communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food refugees and other basic needs are still needed.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's too much.
As World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees remained in the tarpaulin shelters built in the yard of their defense, they saw scenes of road damage, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Although aid groups have already begun the grim start of disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, equipment, and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This disaster is still at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., it's a national disaster, we're going to be open with the help of other countries but there's no such thing as this."
By the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who have lost their loved ones continue to rely on miracles that can stimulate the devastating stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman who had been stranded under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Some of those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an adult in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled that, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to Palu players, who participated in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a grey check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I don't think the messages were sent," he said.
Thieves, pulling out <0x24>26,750 while refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves swept away <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who had refilled the ATM's contents in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle removes an ATM from the entertainment complex and prepares to deliver more money, wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy at the release.
While he was busy, there was another man "running from the back of Brink's character" and stealing a bag of money that had to be delivered.
Several defendants were arrested by witnesses fleeing the area, according to the release, but police did not specify the number of defendants involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity to the Newport police should contact at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change her name to Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former acclaimed Kanye West."
West has long been nicknamed Ye, aged 41, and he used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The film was released on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She will replace the show with singer Ariana Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said in the first part of this year in discussing his album title to radio host Big Boy.
"If so, I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
From Kanye, which means being alone, to being just Ye - being just a mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album reflects more on who we are."
He was one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced the love of the names Love and Brother Love.
Contented with whether or not there were girts and big letters in the name had previously collaborated with West JAY-Z.
Mexico's military says it's not going to be used by civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised in Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to control Mexican citizens."
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, in which about 300 people died during the start of disastrous student movements throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican children by providing monthly assistance to students and opening up more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would trap youth in criminal groups.
U.S. funding should be doubled in A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments have been made after ads were made about AI various parts of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. lacks formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be No.1 on the AI change by 2030.
"It's a good start to double the research budget in AI, as the U.S. has left so much behind all other countries, and we're looking for the next success in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding will double the chance in the U.S. of making the next major success in AI, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, she cared for an AI system defeating the best American player of Otherllo, and subsequently, she became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee acknowledged past technology competitions by the U.S. government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition will be held, to help identify future visionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get help from the government," Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the top academics; otherwise the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have taken luminaries from universities to work with AI over the years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to those with a PhD in AI," he said.
China's State Council published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations fund researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to impose peers from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Regarding NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen by U.S. law seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for several months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name in a referendum
Macedonian citizens voted on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that could set up decades of conflict between Greece and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, suggests a claim to its territory is the name of its neighboring country to the north and it has denied the country's entry into NATO and EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists argued that change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic major population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The ballot in the referendum asked: "Are you in favor of being a member of NATO and the EU along with the acceptance of the treaty in Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth the effort to enter groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by law, the members of parliament said enough that they would follow the result of the vote to confirm it.
Name change requires two-thirds of the majority in parliament.
The state-run commission said there were no reports of irregularity at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted for a Macedonian referendum on the country's name change to open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and suspects seats in front of tents arranged by mob-boycotts in the referendum.
"We look like NATO and EU, but we want to join high-handed and not get into the maiden door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a good reputation.
If they don't accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the most needed investment to Macedonia, with unemployment levels above 20 percent.
"I believe that the large majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the "yes" result would be "a testimony to our future."
A vote published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another vote conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the referendum must be 50 percent and then a turnout.
The referendum's failure will be set up as the first major blow to Western government policy since it took its place in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, taking on Brighton's full defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling scored Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game easy on his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He blossomed between the three defenders of Brighton, before clapping into the open field.
Aguero then sees himself surrounded by four green dresses.
He forced a defender ahead of the run for a few more at the end of the Brighton box.
He then swung to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to grab Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan a thumb on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have reached the goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues the opening advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while deep into Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flanks to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touchdowns before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues pushed the ball forward into the net before crossing the border.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to insist on another start.
But always contender Scherzer hopes to secure the standings on Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies, but that is if the Rockies still have implications in the playoffs with an advantage against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
However, the Rockies scored a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to secure their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, we can step up to the mountain, somehow, knowing that feeling here in Denver, along with the people and the other team, is probably the highest level of any point I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals haven't announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they allegedly turn around to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and pitch on his usual Sunday break.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in the 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
The President did not explicitly specify the situation that wraps up his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the significance of Republicans' results in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November is at stake.
It's only five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm scared to fight the good candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to retract power by any means necessary, you see the consequence, the misfortune.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to have to cut in to achieve the power and control, power and control they want, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a "contested and blocked" mission.
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, as the Democrats called "enraged and twisted and sneaky and lying."
He mentioned the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received strong vocals from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, no, no, I'm waiting for one - that's awful body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
It's not a big church anymore.
It does not accept those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum activists voted on my local party to accuse me, it was no longer surprising.
As a matter of fact, I was the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told we were not accepted - all because of the expression of our thoughts.
My partner in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was falsely accused of a censorship petition for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, which is ironically similar issues to which Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
The note for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's how GC meetings are every Friday night.
Unfortunately today, this is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of "more understanding, more gentle" politics, if it really started at any time.
It is even more noticeable that opposing views on the Labour party are not allowed and judge every opinion on whether it is acceptable to the party's elevators.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as my first colleagues began to rely on me to have a similar political outlook that I turned away and took positions that I would never agree with - either on the national security or on the single market of the EU.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a next parade of social media abuse calling for deselection, saluting politics in the middle, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm even more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm directing are politically inclined.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the growing abuse of sexist or racist every day but never backwards.
One of the most disastrous aspects of politics during this period is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour party should cultivate the culture of acceptance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and along with every petition of "unconfidence" or change of choice policies, the party becomes narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years that I've been pushing myself down, not talking too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I wanted to do in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a pupil, which evoked the feeling of neglect by Thatcher's government that left the classroom literally collapsed my comprehensive school, I have tried to promote better government services for those in greater need - whether as local or local.
I've never tried to hide my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advanced Friday's petition, all I wanted to say is, when the country is plunging into a Brexit that will damage our homes, our economics, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But, to be honest, a message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, whether it's my representatives, whether it's a member of Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of secession or political expediency will stop me from acting in whatever I think is best for your sake.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ascended to the top of Ayr
The final two tests have passed, but Ayr is undoubtedly eligible to win the stunning and entertaining match of the Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the uniquely unsettled side of the ten.
Ultimately, their unique defense, such as their better chance takeover, brought home side and coach Peter Murchie every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we still haven't lost, so I should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The beauty of Ayr, they're better off on the race than we are."
Grant Anderson's try put in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, puts Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for Scottish cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors game, gave Melrose permission to score and get an unconverted Jason Bagtry.
Climo broke Ayr's lead on a penalty, before, exactly at half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt was reduced, with Baggot converting just five points.
Subsequently, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, released by the strutcher, and from the restart, Ayr attacked forward with Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
The yellow card was given to Ayr's standing captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the additional man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the storm of fierce force.
However, the home side returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson knocked down behind the forward Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanker Gregory Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
It's still a game that looks like it's ready for a new career in the food industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran appeared ready to move into the hospitality industry after discovering that he was named the director of a licensed food company.
Jack Jarvis plays the 56-year-old on the popular BBC show, which he writes and talks with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last to run the show, and Kiernan appeared to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun reporter indicated that Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant trade".
'To us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval outpost wrapped up in rigging at La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a flag that is as blue as the sea.
The oceans from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are named after the saying: "The sea is ours according to the law.
It's a duty to restore it."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody struggle with natural resources in the 19th century - such as seeking to resettle in the Pacific Ocean.
Those expectations have been at the highest possible level for several decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the World Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a sense of unity, and security, and it hopes, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens nationwide, full of hopes that the Hague tribunal will grant the request of Bolivia that - after decades of stunning talks - Chile is obliged to unite to give Bolivia a free channel to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial contest for next year's re-election - also has many things dependent on Monday's decision.
"We will soon be back in the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some people believe that the court has little chance of making a decision in favour of Bolivia - and little will change if this happens.
The Netherlands-based UN board has no power to produce Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide the consequences of possible conversations.
This means that the case is "not complicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision in just six months after hearing final arguments, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean global law expert.
And far from the progress of Bolivia's struggle, it may have been blocked for the past four years.
"The current administration of Bolivia has hacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric weakened any remaining goodwill of the Chileans, he suggested.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represented Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision rate was unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 people of misunderstanding while both sides are benefiting," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgement is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival nations.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be relaunching nuclear diplomacy after a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said it was a "deep dream" that North Korea would kneel down by continuing to impose sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration that would end the Korean War.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without taking any important steps in the reduction of weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the use of weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its survival.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris revealed the latest line of big headwear that is about to be released on a High Street near you
If you want to grow your hat collection or completely cover the sun, don't look for others.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have released a range of uniquely masculine headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway so the style set at Paris Fashion Week has become a fabulous one.
This summer's Instagram has spread out overwhelmingly unpractical hats and these designers have brought their call-panning creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's distinctive piece is a truly unique beige-colored hat decorated with a wide brim of applause that surrounds the heads of models.
Other large decorations include brilliant watermelons, a wizard hat and also a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head glowing.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of odd masks that were perfect for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have remains and are much more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
There is a creation similar to the scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while there is another that looks like a cone of melted ice cream.
If you're going to continue this great fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that large bonnets will soon be released on the high streets near you.
The arrival of the grown hat following 'La Bomb', the straw hat with a brim of two feet and seen dressed by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely non-practical hat spread on social media has sent yet another major creation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw almost as large as the swimsuit model with it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied with white leather handle, is the exclusive piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacques at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags arrive on the high street next summer – because of the size of the impression the designer has made, it is difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.’
John Edward: Language skills that are important to the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain the track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with the help of another body of excellent results of the exam, reinforcing only individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
Along with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen career and place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector that designs and implements accredited school curriculum, we see modern languages continue as popular and preferred topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it's in his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will enter his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we should not only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we will see that language is leading the league tables with the highest rate of passing to independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages gained a higher grade A.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are sporting foreign languages as essential skills that youth will no doubt need in the future.
Languages today, as a subject of choice, are considered equivalent to STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curriculums of independent schools elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, employers found that on the reasons given for the difficulty of occupying vacant positions, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are especially needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Along with the increase in potential employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these capabilities are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have future advantages for having a lifelong ability like this.
People who speak many languages will automatically gain advantage because of their ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak in foreign languages and only French was spoken in two digits, which was 15 percent.
This is why it is important for young people today to invest in language education.
Ability in many languages, particularly in developing economies, will give young people a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools can be diverse when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there is always a choice of language in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are focused on providing an environment suitable for instruction that will prepare young people and give them the ability needed to be successful, no matter what their future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in the area of global business, that language knowledge remains important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be regarded as the "faculty of global interaction."
Independent schools continue to offer this option, diversity and efficiency for young people of Scotland.
It's good to be fair.
John Edward was Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans hoping to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers is nearing completion.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"More than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James may have limited minutes to play.
Following the rehearsal in the early part of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games in the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will launch a hurricane of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five Trump's scheduled rallies next week, including visiting allies such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation awaits his choice to fill the vacant position in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to generate support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to meet on hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of abusiveness while holding the Senate's expected vote of confirmation for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the rallies was to help the Republicans gain momentum to face strong elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said that these five rallys next week focused on "motivating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for his agenda to go to the president in as many states as possible as we are heading into the busy campaign period," a Trump campaign spokesman said.
The rally is scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and it can deliver supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get reports from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it will be the second time in last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go to the president to try to strengthen him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to maintain hope for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may need this Ryder Cup.
A fully invented concept in the field of sports is the "swinging pendulum of momentum" but players believe it, especially in competitions like this.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They've only got six points, and now they're only four, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left.
The advantage is in Europe, of course, only four points and twelve more left.
The Americans, said Speith, saw that they had a little bit of pride and courage, when Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and there were three points out of four.
Spieth leads her side and she's stunned from tea to green.
The celebration's screams grew stronger as he went through the round, he was able to enter an important putt to make a table in four matches after being two down after two with Thomas.
There was at the same time his putt shouted that won them the match at 15, the kind of scream that said the match was not over for the American side.
"You just have to be careful and think about your own game," Spieth said.
This is all that remains for every player.
18 hours to make a mark.
The only players to score higher points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
Four out of four and can't do anything wrong with the unique but amazing pairs from Europe.
"Molliwood" was the only pair that did not live in the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That buzz, and how their energy seems to flow from and to a noisy viewer is proof that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and that no more popular player can determine a win for the Europeans at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible, go along with different holes.
However, it seems that the issue of European elections has been delayed.
Bubba Watson and Webb SImpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine sent Spaniard and Swede, and they were unable to get up.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's comforting to watch fourballs and foursomes closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice given and they don't give, and the possible sudden change of strategy.
Europe played better as a group today and they managed to head for the last day but this foursome session showed the strength and strength of Team USA in question by some, especially by Stateside.
Europe scores 10-6 to enter the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will only enter the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's exit from fourballs and foursome matches with just 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini's stable pair led with two wins against struggling Tiger Woods to bring their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side that included Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the trophy they had lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the American side who initiated the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more in foursomes, and won two matches but could not lower the advantage.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Mollwood" after a very good weekend, the second pair to win just four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they combined forces to defeat disillusioned Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who dragged himself into two matches on Saturday, showed short runs of well-being but had already received a defeat in 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive runs.
Justin Rose took a break for fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were in first and third rank in the world.
The weather was not good for Europe even though the weather was clear and windy in the southwest part of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a vigorous 2<0x26>1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after defeating the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point deficit into singles, but as holders Furyk's side only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of being second in position, it seems they could not afford a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it's "unilateral" to distrust
North Korea's foreign minister to the United Nations said on Saturday that their suspicions in the United States were deepened due to continued sanctions and that the country would never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under this situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives around the world that North Korea has taken "important steps with good intentions" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear test sites, and promising not to produce nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"While there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under this situation we are not really unilateral to discriminate."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of a "single" denuclearization strategy that honors North Korea as it takes small steps, his statement seemed important as it did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current President of the United States and head of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first surrender their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to reduce strict international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on denuclearizing" and raising the weight of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent way, and they are also opposed to "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions will disturb us is a deep dream of people who don't know about us.
The problem is, however, that we continue to have a deepening of our doubts."
Ri has no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States chief announced to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister announced three meetings between Kim and the head of South Korea Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States were the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not lead to a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's United States territory of rockets after Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "absolutely destroy" North Korea, hailed Kim for his bravery in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for it, and also said, "If it lasts two years, three years or five months - there is no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honor Pyongyang for measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Security Council sanctions should continue to be strictly and unprecedented until we fully know about widespread, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council jointly weighed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that there had been a progression, only to make North Korea feel guilty about his making "digger demands."
North Korea has promised a meeting with Moon this month to break down a missle site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "equal measures".
He said Kim mentioned to him "the corresponding steps" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised Singapore and the way to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students, take a course on getting enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course helps its undergraduates get a good night's sleep in an attempt to fight the macho culture of studying all night while energizing with caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's number one university often don't know about the most basic ways to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine teacher at Harvard Medical School and a Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist, designed the course, which he believed to be the earliest of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of sleeplessness on the study.
“After that, a woman approached me and said, ‘Why didn’t you tell me this, in my senior year?’
According to him, no one told him about the amount of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course was released for the first time this year explaining to students the importance of having good sleep habits and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely under-sleeping during the week.
An hour-long course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to tell you about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticity, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleeplessness increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, which encourage participants to think about their daily activities.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of having ‘all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students increases the problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should serve as the students' ‘secret weapon' to combat stress, intense fatigue and anxiety, he says - also to avoid weight gain, because the brain's sleep deprivation in the state of hunger, so they become starving constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after taking a class in his first year at Harvard.
He said that his eyes were opened and he had the inspiration to pursue a school course.
He hopes that the next step will be asked students to complete a learning program similar to this before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should think about setting an alarm when to fall asleep and wake up, and identify the adverse effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which could damage circadian rhythm, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's team down
The Rangers again experienced disappointment after Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first win at the opponent's stadium since they won 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, to suspend his side by eight points against Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't look like the Rangers' line-up was blocked by inspiration.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is third and just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more problems waiting for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be given a remedy for the head injury after apparently rocking something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to pass Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi 11 who scored against Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with how his good team managed to keep their rivals from each turn.
The Rangers had been on top of the ball handling but Livingston did more when the ball was in their possession.
They should have scored two minutes after Allan McGregor's pass to Scott Pittman, but the midfielder went a long way.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs caught up with Craig Halkett but defender Alan Lithgow was unable to do anything except to force the ball into the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, have gained control but seem to have a greater sense of confidence than to be able to accomplish their plan in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick by the end of a quarter of the game when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers made two tight-knit rebounds in the first half of the game but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to defeat Lassana Coulibaly's header and a light striker by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its opening despite the opponent's seemingly better, they could not be deemed worthy there because of their graft only.
The Rangers failed again to act against the deep-seated set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher swept the ball into the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for easy finishing.
Gerrard acted in the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch almost had a quick effect when the winger could slotch Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line quickly to block that.
But Livingston continues to torture visitors to play the exact type of game they want, where successively sweep their long ball Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's side could have just grown up in the finals but McGregor managed to keep Jacobs out of the way before Lithgow could go wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another last appeal for a penalty because they were tied up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not look back.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and PRAY YOUR MARRIAGE...the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany to become a physicist someday.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later deliver a device called Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger Counter has also been a major support in pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," which features what appears to be the vague cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that thing?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that radioactivity causes on minerals."
Evans: "It must be sounding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention attached to his name continued.
A new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to "identify" harmful cells
The new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to "identify" harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells
The procedure includes taking immune cells in the patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory
Then they can 'identify' the protein that is common to most cancers and then inject them back.
The testing vaccine provides good results to patients with various cancers.
For more than 18 months, a woman's ovarian cancer has been lost to a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure includes extracting immune cells from a patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory to "determine" them is the protein common in most cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results indicate that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon, explains Prof Berzofsky.
It works in the treatment of type leukaemia a similar method of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to destroy cancer cells.
Kanye West joined Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After her SNL Release.
The Results Did Not Be Good
The "boo" chanted Kanye West at the studio while performing Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said she would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he criticized Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to a white man many times and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I'm concerned about racism, I should have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show in a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star entertained Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Election on sexual exploitation complaints presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded a footage of West's gossip.
It's unclear if Rock is trying to humiliate West from the post.
West also complained to the audience that he hadn't stopped at the backstage about his hat.
"They beat me on the back.
They said, ‘Don’t come out wearing ‘that hat’.’
They've bullied me!
And they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the sunken place?" when he said, he did "I put on my own superman's cape, because it means, you can't dictate what I should do. You want the world to thrive?
Try to find love."
Because of his comments, the audience booed at least twice and the cast members of the SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety report, and there was a man there who declared in the publication: "The silence wrapped up the whole studio."
West was introduced as a chasing replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
Many were disturbed by West's performance of the song I Love it, where she was dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the strongest will: THANK YOU ABOUT HUMANS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "true and undoubtedly wonderful."
"But I choose not to recognize a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and expresses the ideology that is inherent in my community.
He has freedom.
We are the same," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg had the former name of Snoop Lion and, of course, died music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.
The case of a murder attempt at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a man stabbed a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
Discuss the allegations by means of the Public Tax Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Kington has been critically acclaimed
Kit Harington is best known for his starring sword Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, strongly criticized the brush defender's stereotype, according to him such roles on the screen lead to the frequent thinking of young men that they need to be tough to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to discuss the problem of destructive masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she has a 'deep desire' to discuss the issue.
"My personal preferences today - where did we go wrong with masturbation?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problems we see today?"
Kit believes television has a role to play in the rise of harmful masturbation due to its infamous characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of guy?
I thought, ‘That’s one of the biggest questions in our time – how can we change that?’
"There's something wrong with young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he said, "he's finished in the fields of war and cavalry."
Starting in November, Kit will star in the re-release of True West by Sam Shepard's story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that their acquaintance with his wife Rose was what he considered to be the best thing that ever happened to Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in the show ‘to this,' it became the way I had a family in the future, and the way my life would be from it,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who liked Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won the Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 in Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14<0x25> increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been passed through sexual intercourse, marking a change from the past.
HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increases annually to 100,000.
A chronic issue in China's LGBT community is HIV transmission through sexual intercourse.
Homosexuality in China was banned in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90<0x25> of men who have had sex with men eventually get married with a woman.
Most infections are caused by a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff has distributed the data of GOP senators, and insists on "fake lies" and "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages for legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat's "ultra-right wing" scheme has insisted on the complaints and website.
"Liars, lies, and many more lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the released information included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill as a panel hearing in the Senate was held on charges of sexual immorality against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came out a few minutes after the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
In the Hill report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState linked to Waters's office announced the IP address referring to the source of the posts and it provided Waters' staff member information.
"It's totally wrong and a lie is this baseless charge," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - who compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - has nothing to do with the dissemination of this information.
This false accusation is absolutely false and a lie."
Waters's remarks, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, have quickly picked up batikos online.
"There is anger at this refusal," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that he does not have the necessary conduct of a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He should not be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the defendant.
He should be calm and respectful."
Fleischer has come out comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' denouncement of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being too smiling during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and entities in the enforcement of the law regarding these fraudulent complaints."
"We will make sure to meet those responsible," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all the activities they are destructive and risking anyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - captured spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for significance for Brexit in any new film biased in Britain and it seems to fit into the new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 in Johnny English and made noise again in 2011 in Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be a new opportunity to export the country's eccentric self-interest with the subject matter of how remarkable our lack of meaning is?
Despite all this, the big-eyed and luminous-looking Johnny English without being released had a license to reopen things for the second time - more than anything else, his name suggests that he was a magnificent comic made for places where viewers don't speak English.
Of course, he is a crazy secret agent who despite his odds of pretending to be an elegant swabbe has a little character by Clouseau, with Mr. Bean and mixed by a portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire tune theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he caused unrest in his own eyes.
There are one or two beautiful scenes in this latest JE show.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter as he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades quickly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent can be seen in physical humor, but extreme humor has not been effective and has not been natural, especially with confidence now adding humor as an element to it brands of "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
There used to be humor that it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's comic strips were not as creative and clear as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in Bean's person.
The current premise that has long been experienced in the area is the placement of Great Britain in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker has entered Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, which has led to disappointment with the agent being duped - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the latest thing to break the prime minister who is an arrogant and arrogant person, who is already experiencing complete anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson investigates the performance of this mal-Teresa-May character but doesn't get much pressure from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since all the active spies had compromised, he had to return something from the retirement.
And that's referring to high school-schooler Johnny English himself, who now works as the head teacher at an exclusive institution, but provides private lessons on how to be an undercover operative: funny ‘to it', because English offers a high-School of Rock espionage academy.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former suffering sidekick Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, who is married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Batman and Robin have returned to action with their secret service, and they will meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is at risk of falling into the appeal of the charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer disturbances: the ill-fated Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough have begun their long adventures with ridiculous pretenders: pretending to be waiters, they start a fire at a pricey French restaurant; they make a scene to ride without noticing Volta's luxurious yacht; and he starts a huge mess with Virset Real when he tries to use it.
There's no doubt that everything is going well in that final sequence, but even though it's entertaining and complex, there's no doubt that it's a youthful TV show in its entirety.
Not so much.
And I can't stop myself thinking about other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that could give justice to his talent?
Labour denied that it was planning to have four working days a week for the British but could pay them the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to have the British four days a week working - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, they want the company's bosses to pass on those who have been spared a significant change in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them an extra rest day.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to return home to the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the country's workers.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the replacement of four days a week of work as a way to give workers the opportunity to change the economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: "Announcement of policy analysis is expected before the end of the year.
"It can't be done one night but four days a week's work is a goal that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy for the good of the producers and also for the overall strategy in the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party had promised four days of work a week during its campaigning for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party is currently not upholding this goal as a whole.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "the party is not a policy of four days working a week and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour discussion to better explain his dream of a revolutionary economic socialism.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he is determined to withdraw power from 'no-looking directors' and 'people exploiting pipelines' to utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get the sum of their stakes because the Labour government may impose "reductions" for the premeditated misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of the company and set up the Inclusive Ownership Funds to provide 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, with annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in "60 Minutes" if they could change their minds in the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett has retracted the final vote in his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and there has been a question of whether the department will be able to get Republican senators back their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there were anything from the FBI's possible findings that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina partner.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the meeting, I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘to this, after the accusation came out, I said, 'Did you do it'?'
He's full of courage, he's determined, and there's no bathing."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be unchanged.
"My mind is full about Brett Kavanaugh and a big charge will be needed for it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I do know: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not all the people to whom he has given the name can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a superb line-up of stars performing and having a similarly amazing mission; the end of world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by thousands of people who will meet at Central Park's Great Law not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge for the true purpose of the event to end serious hardship by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively resisting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those going to the concert must complete a set of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, calling a difficult phone call or anything meaningful to help out awareness.
But how much success has global citizens now with only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to encourage people to engage in action or just add it to what is called "clicktivism" - do people feel they are able to make a real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging the host of various purposes.
These actions have helped encourage world leaders to advertise provisions and assurances amounting to more than <0x24>37 billion that will make a change in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 provisions and advertising stemming from its actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of these were already spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimated that the guaranteed funds had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major providers included The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. investment and implementation partner focused on "helping children grow up discovering their full potential," who pledged to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after it received more than 4 million.
"With the support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote that has historically been the social injustice of nutrition deprivation," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 calls to focus on nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and youth through nutritional procedures.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "how do you think we can end so much poverty?"
Global Citizens responded: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like our predecessors who have taken great action on civil rights and actions against the policy of white separation from black, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together.
Along with Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe in a few performers at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy for "blocking the passage" to prevent Russia's energy export - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able to "if necessary" to use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from transporting to the market, including the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said Russia's interaction with Syria - specifically where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government - was just a cover to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers as they are in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, using our Navy, to ensure that sea passageways are open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their exercises do not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke with attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, approximately, to benefit and replace energy," he said, saying Russia "is only aware of what to do" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come out as the Trump administration promotes exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to slip into the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is why Moscow has become "controlling" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is scheduled to double the pipeline's current capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's intense opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and an example of non-stop competition.
"I believe we both have a view that energy cannot be used as a tool for masking and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s outlook from Germany drew a strong response, strengthening its stance on the project.
Germany's leading organization for the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to avoid interference in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There's a big problem when other states interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Thinking Good" by Elizabeth Warren to Run for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that running for the presidency was "thinking carefully" following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes a woman as president," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm really thinking about running for president."
Warren addressed President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that "this country is being taken in the wrong direction.
"I'm really very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our economy," he said.
Warren had previously spoken out in his criticism of Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituencies are not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the run.
The survey showed more support for running former Governor Deval Patrick, who 38 percent supported the possible run and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in connection with the possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin spent a year in Iraq, 26, after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a family violence incident on Monday night.
"With my son on his return, I understand the other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the feelings our soldiers had on their return," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "great problem not to talk about" and said that his son and other veterans of the war were "returning somewhat differently, they return to practice in violence, asking if there is any respect for anything given in the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every member of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence, particularly women's torture, interference in reporting on family violence and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports questioning of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported legal questioning of a new U.S. policy denying asylum for victims fleeing gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the friend-of-the-court district briefed on Friday in Washington to support a man seeking asylum questioning policy, NBC News reported.
The defendant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said he had been abused by his partner "and his children of violent gang members," but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which has been the source of a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "ignoring many decades of state, federal, and world law".
"The federal law decrees that all appeals for asylum will be judged on the basis of particular facts and events of the appeal, and that such a ban violates such principle," said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Attorneys in the brief argued that the policy of denying immigrant entry is harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "support the need for labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on the policy on June 11.
Asylum is never intended to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths in rescue survivors doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her stretching baby boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance carrying bodies.
There is not enough clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up their wet uses, trying to save anything they could see.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Several of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who gained a back and shoulder fracture, were resting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recounted how the earthquake felt in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she and her husband and daughter were staying.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was pressured into the fallen wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my husband ask for help, then it's gone, quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'shocking' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after a Chinese official published four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of the U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid statement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of interference in the election for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, a charge China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. elections have marked a mark on U.S. officials in Reuters' new phase of Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a growing trade war in which they exchange tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs in the first stage of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agriculture products in China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China "is now stressing the bullying by releasing advertising propaganda in our own free newspaper."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free expression through the release of paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in Beijing's newspaper stores, you will see only a limited conflicting voice and you will not see a real picture of the differences in Chinese opinions about China's disturbing economic direction, because the Chinese Communist Party is holding tightly to the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China has avoided the offer to be published" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans pushing women's voters away before Midterms to Kavanaugh's Trouble, Analysts Warning
While many major Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will face severe reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about it are so intense, and it is seen in most Republicans listed that they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be abandoned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would have enough backing for the FBI's investigation to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the modern MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is near!" as they rallied in the Senate corridor because Republicans who had control of the Committee of Human Rights chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motive will be unusual," said Stu Rothenberg, an unpopular political analyst.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it may even increase, especially with swing female voters in suburban areas and with young voters, between 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts say that there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continue the confirmation.
"This has been a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit down, it's also about how Republicans handle the issue and how they deal with it," explained Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans seem to be coming out of their way to believe in Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, when fewer are sided in the end.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford confirmed before the Senate Judiciary Committee after being sworn in last week that he was abused by drunken Kavanaugh when he was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his son while they were in a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, will launch a startup aimed at countering Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the purpose behind Inrupt was to "encompass the whole world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is that the user is completely in control of who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "self-powering through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company with them techniques, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers who have been hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to release a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this next web season," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in attacking Bentenglise and Lehaucourt.
But, a sniper killed him four days later and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was stripped of the veil of his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "a shining symbol" to expose the stone during a 100-year test from the respectable work of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in heavy dew as it rained bullets from fields and machine guns."
Later, he went to the first row and led the line forward with "greatest courage" before rushing with a field-gun and hitting all three of the team on his own.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can't match but something humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also offered a flower crown after the parade, headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that it was "the honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown by the support that many people give."
MMA fans don't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig is watching them.
Think about it, you wake up all night to watch the Bellator 206 arrow but you're not allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six of the main cards and is shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their presentation, UK audiences were surprised when coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up until the early days of the fight.
A Twitter fan said the move to the young cartoon "looks like a bad joke."
"The government's policy is that at 6 a.m. it's not appropriate to watch such a show so they have to move to the youth show," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications by Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would set up their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about the replay, maybe we can fix it," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, Monday.
But we're fixing it.
Believe me, when they moved there, there were a lot of repeating texts and all of these were outraged.
We tried to fix it, we thought technical glitch.
But no, it has to do with the government.
I can promise that this won't happen in the future.
We're just going to do five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and we've tried to give the fans a lot but we're overdone.
It's just a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘humble' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think about it until he got to secondary school that "not everyone was like him."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs loved by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that parenting has reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular longtime show's producer, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months due to illness.
Released as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than the others as he grew up because "it's not easy to accept love for both men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I was inferior, and that I felt different, the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "different," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexuality later on.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics became a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his release at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that the love of a man - the US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was shocked to me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through a lot at a young age" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find a man of age who experienced the same happiness and loneliness.
The couple became parents in June, with their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all that matters is, 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
Her son named her father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept his death and one of the last questions he asked was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front seat.
"I can't tell you that you're not going to sit in front of me, Dad," he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and it was only then that she really didn't breathe and that she was really dead that I accepted she didn't take care of," she said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her first chosen song - Heather Small's Proud - to stare at her in the upcoming Olympics and still stand on her feather.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday and 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to adjust his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event for the record 12th, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as often happens to him for the United States, a five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and training in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Since he never became the most direct driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old was unsuitable for the tight Le Golf National course, where often the wrong shots in the long rough were a problem.
And the hard course doesn't seem to be enough, Mickelson is still facing Sunday's ninth match, to British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined amateur Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who broke four points starting with 12 singles matches, were to start hot, Mickelson's match could be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understands his role today, squeezing me back and guiding me and saying he's ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more dreams, but that's what happened and 'that's what we thought we were going to go.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Ryder Cup race that never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 threes, and seven boards, although Furyk said his presence brought some invisible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, funny with people, and he's good with the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have enjoyed him, this week, and it's fun to watch.
He's given more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big loss will soon be
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows on the basis of experience that it is easy to lose the big singles only on the final day in the Ryder Cup and can be uncomfortable fighting it.
The Danish started the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain held only five points against the Americans but failed to reach the finish line because the margin was too small, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're always reminding yourself that we're just big in Valderrama; we're just big in Brookline, and we're losing there, and in Valderrama, we're winning, but hopefully," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it's not over yet.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not finished until you put the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've already said that I'm going to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players in the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
It's another monster tomorrow.
It’s an open individual performance that can be seen, and that’s another activity.
It's good to go out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you'll be able to test the limits of your golfer's ability.
That's the message you need to understand to the players, to release everything you can tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner and he has to go and get out of it as much as he can."
Compared to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of major changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing when Europe displayed "Miracle and Medinah."
"I remember every word here," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you've seen in Brookline, as you've seen in Medinah.
When the balloon goes in one direction, it brings great pressure to the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're bringing out the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the prize game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"This is what I did in order of this group of players because I think it was the best until the end," Bjorn told his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship was postponed again
Germany's latest frigate in 2014 should have been assigned to replace old warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year due to system defects and rising costs, local media reported.
The appointment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the headship of the newborn Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing what a military spokesman said.
The ship had to be included in the Navy in 2014, but the big project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be traded to the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they have strong artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas - will be old-fashioned when the time comes for them to enter service, Die Zeit said.
The lucky F125 frigate was headlined last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited some "flaws of essential software and hardware" that would make warship useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be run by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workers of the older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, the ship came out too heavy to reduce its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice as heavy as the same ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - rising from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that wrap up the latest frigates are becoming increasingly important because of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "depleted by ships that could be deployed."
The officer said the issue had grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no replacement vessels were given.
He stressed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were involved in the Navy.
The National Trust explores the secret life of bats
New research conducted outside a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their food search.
It is expected to illuminate the behavior of strange flying mammals and help guide future care activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared panic Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats over time.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound analysis experts in all recordings confirm the frequency of bats' vocals and which species makes which sound.
Then, a residential map will be created to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes to reveal the results of which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of residential management activities such as field creation and what is the best way to complete the woods for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has greatly decreased over the past century.
They are at risk from construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind powered turbines and lightning can also pose hazards, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated with building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their hunting at night their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in the path they are taking.
The bats are important to the NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country.
It has trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect nests and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only reserved Scottish bat land at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson claims that the estate is the best territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a good place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all beautiful homes.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and other assets will help to understand more about what they need to survive."
He stresses the importance of inspecting bats before performing maintenance within the property because it is possible to accidentally destroy at least one mother's nest could kill 400 women and young bats, which is likely to annihilate the entire local population.
Bats are protected and unlawful to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust Elisabeth Ferrell is urging the public to help.
He said: "We can learn a lot more about our bats and we don't know the population climate of many of our species."
Ronaldo ignores rape charges as lawyers prepare to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to the allegations of rape against him as "fake news," saying that some people "want to flaunt themselves" with his name.
His lawyers were scheduled to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While talking to an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"It's been a while," he said to the camera, winning the Ballon d'Or five times.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
That is normal.
They wanted to be famous so I mentioned my name, but it was just a job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages at the cost equivalent to the intrusion weight, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where she allegedly raped the woman, according to papers presented to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "sympathetic man" who was frustrated by "one percent."
Documents alleged that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but they both wanted it.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and photographed his wounds at a hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement because "he was afraid of retaliation" and was concerned that "it would be embarrassing to the public."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to reverse the arrangement as he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK's 'long-life regret' loss of car manufacturers
The UK's "lifetime regret" if it loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concernful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without an agreement it would temporarily split production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of the border delay in the absence of a Brexit agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year and 90<0x25> of these were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have released their fears about leaving the EU without a deal on how trade with borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what vehicle manufacturers say are the risks of supply chain in the event of no Brexit agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis where parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border disruption that the industry says could cause delays and lack of shares.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's inventory value at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "decently arranged to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow not only for us to enjoy success at the moment but for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to fully continue any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that over a long period of time, additional costs in the plant's ability to compete and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said, "In my experience, once it is gone, these jobs can't be returned.
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trumpat's crucial meeting of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" as the problem continues with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's intervention in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russia's aides and a possible presidential obstruction of justice.
Trump has been debating the deputy attorney general for months, and whether Mueller's independence is at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record their Trump conversations and the possibility of deposing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wanted not to" Rosenstein but recorded the meeting to avoid conflict in the Senate's judicial committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed full Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no set date for that, maybe this week, it may be postponed another week due to all the other things happening in the supreme court.
We'll keep an eye on the press and keep it up to date."
Some reporters will object to his remarks: Sanders has not held a press briefing in While House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a dislike for the "promoting" of TV reporters, although he said: "I'm not opposed to that they're really growing up."
Then, he indicated that there would be more direct relations between Trump and the press.
"The president is doing more Q<0x26>A sessions than his predecessors," he said, adding with no mention of evidence: "We're looking at these numbers."
There will be briefings," said Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States themselves, it's better 'that' than to talk to me.
We're trying to do that often and you see we've done it frequently in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences at visiting dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president has probably shown why, in the display of informality and sometimes odd looks in front of reporters.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU personnel working in the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter today with fewer than six months left until the UK retreated from the EU.
The Scottish Government has pledged to meet the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens working on its devolved public services.
In his letter, Ms Freeman said: "Last summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued on the departure, hoping there will be decisions this fall.
But the UK Government has also stressed its preparations for a possible non-consensus.
I know it's an exciting time for all of you.
So now I want to repeat how important each person's contribution is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Peers from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of healthcare services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Deep in Emergency Surgery After Having a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie was in emergency surgery after gaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat at Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and just fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainers and medical personnel on the sideline before he was placed on the stretcher and taken for additional evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/limit of the damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out where the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers in the UK will be charged with higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and use additional money to help the homeless under Tory's new plans.
The step is to counter Corbyn's wish to attract young voters
Increase in taxpayers in the UK
Wealth expects to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to charge higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and will use additional money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be considered to be an anticipation of Jeremy Corbyn's success to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and target those who make big profits.
Stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the UK, and will use additional money to support the Government's desire to solve street sleep.
Surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary residences and in houses purchased for rent - could have increased by three percent.
Wealth expects this step to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new-built properties are bought by non-residents of the UK, which increases prices so that buyers become more difficult to buy homes for the first time.
Many wealthy places in the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because many foreigners buy away from the country for most of the time.
The new policy comes out just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp duty to help younger adults buy their first house.
He blamed large construction companies for the continued high prices of property by purchasing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to lay aside quotas in affordable homes to fix Britain's "humiliating housing".
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of compelling proposed housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending evictions for "no reason whatsoever".
He also wanted to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would provide my premiere in restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we need to fix the problem of the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have life here.
However, it's not that easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies, to buy homes such as hard-working British residents.
Too many people have dreamed of having a home, and the impoverishment of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: "My ambition is above all the Scottish government"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ambition above all" is to be the ruler of Scotland when the day comes.
Scot, 42, appreciated the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to St Mirren's Stadium this summer after heading back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always seemed like someone was calling me back.
That's the only way I'll be able to manage the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has no fear of following such well-known names in such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The victory for me at this moment will be based on 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the arrangement and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly included in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to bring it there, but maybe I'll just consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross was only three years in his management career, after becoming assistant boss in Dumbarton and being part of Hearts' coaching staff for 15 months.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from the bottom in the third tier, and changed St Mirren from the lowest to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before when he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It must have been a great experience," he recalled with respect to the jury.
"I really believe that governance suits me, more than playing.
It's kind of weird because I've been playing well, I've been able to live here, and have had fun moments.
But playing is difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I’m still going through it when it comes to stress and pressure at work but the management is just right.
I've always wanted to rule and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling of myself in my entire life as an adult."

According to the survey, Saturday's 5:30pm is the best time for a pint
The hot summer has increased sales of difficult pubs in Britain but has brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, who accumulated the numbers, said: "Continuing sunrise and longer England's expected participation in the World Cup followed in July what happened in June, when pub sales rose 2.8 percent, but restaurants hit more intensely.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The sales of pubs and bar drinks were the main goods strongest, and when compared with the two seasons, they raised much more than the restaurants downgraded.
Summer also has no good effect on pub food, although the main goods are not as intense as restaurant operators do.
People just want to go out and drink.
In managed pubs and bars, drink sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM analysts of leisure and hospitality said: "These results are continuing the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors affecting the market market of those outside their homes.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8 percent decrease in sales each year will become more painful when it is added to the continued pressure of expenses.
The long summer weather is not good for food operators and only time can tell if the situation will improve with the arrival of the colder temperatures we experienced in August."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, suggesting slowing the brand's release.
The industry sales tracker Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's founding basis.

Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account shown to parents
One in five children - some only 11 years old - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from older people.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid rise in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news intensifies fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clean "main" account shown to parents, while they also have private accounts.

The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistress" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of about 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of these admit they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to creating internet spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "bosses for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government branch.
Doyle is Scotland's most-winning track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for game guides to benefit from his extensive global level experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a great respect for sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in standing as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."

He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time to tell me if I am well or at what level.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, I learned how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be agile!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Share the Internet's opinion on advertising for breast pumps where mothers are compared to cows
The Breast Pump company has divided opinions on the internet due to advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cows being bought.
To mark the launch of what they say was "the world's first silently worn breast bump," Elvie company released a humorous sarcastic music video advertisement to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay in the play with lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm dancing myself but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed I'm not tingling ‘that' those, my breasts are 'that".
The chorus continues: "Bring, squeeze, I'll milk the baby, squeeze, squeeze, I'll milk my boots."
But the advertising has caused controversy over the internet, which has already been published on the company's Facebook page.
There have been 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, and the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it superficially overwhelms the "terrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's really not a good decision to use cows to advertise the product.
"We need to get pregnant and have children to produce milk, so their offspring are just a few days away from birth," one said.
Elvie breast pump is synonymous without detection in the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's very traumatic for mother and baby.
"Why don't you use them to protect your baby's breasts?"
Another added: "There's no bad advertising."
Some of the people were saying that the song was "laughing" for her.
"This is an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I had been breastfeeding.
I felt like I was really pumping.
The advertisement is a bit of a nuisance, but I think it is.
"This is a product," said one.
Another comment: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their labors or cubes) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women will reveal that they are all dancing with an undetected pump inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump milk say they feel like they're cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, without wires or tubes and agrees inside the nursing bra unknowingly, so women are more movable, they are more able to handle their babies, and are even able to get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD to Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump has brought a huge change so it should be given a bold and stimulating launch.
Comparing the pumping women and cows we wanted to attract the attention of milk pumping and all the hard things about it, while showing comfortably and for the first time the great convenience brought by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has become the head of the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother came up for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children migrated to a tent camp in the Texas Border
The number of decent children migrants is rising even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly because it has become more difficult to put children in sponsorships as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration.
Typically, most sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to be put into jeopardy of their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and share data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, appeared in Congress to have arrested the agency of dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individual sponsors or family members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and most of these are foreign criminals.
So we continue to pursue such individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order for children to be processed faster, officials have implemented new policies that will appoint them to appear before the court within a month of decency, rather than 60 days later, which is the former standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will face a video conference call, rather than personally, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for help are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or lonely, which could lead to intense anger or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Supporters said those concerns were more intense in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty are unlikely to be noticed, due to its size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare their emotions or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many already suffer.
U.S., France and Turkey have been told by Syria to leave
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war is already in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the Syrian lands was illegal, denounced the fight against terrorism, and "to be dealt with as appropriately as possible."
"They had to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more had to be evacuated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "walk through the sacred conflict until both terrorist groups are expelled from all Syrian territories" and "any foreign presence that is unlawful."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly doing training and counseling on Kurds forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land forces in the country suffering from war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed the "western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We've called on the global community and charitable organizations to simplify these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing the full-fledged issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
In the Russian-Turkey treaty, the Syrian-backed Syrian forces have been prevented from attacking the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear margins" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which is "extinct."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members will soon be held to write down the fundamental law after the war for Syria and to allow the election.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warning against intervention.
Why Trump won the second term.
In that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again except, as many liberal viewers would expect, if his presidency would be terminated early by ousters and scandals.
In an undoubtedly "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Today, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have increased to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly triple to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable ratings to a total of 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which was about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol broke down in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He recalls taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
The chaos was excruciating.
Of course, unlike other TV users, stories coming from Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families reunite, and the health of the global economy.

If it were me, I'd think it would be different than Super Mario.

When I caught Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees hot outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was on record.
He could not leave the show, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and suspended the future of the Supreme Court.
"I was surprised when we were doing funny shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a good idea, but they were right."

Money from outside floods in the most tense conflict in Congress in the midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th-century cash flooding, thanks to the changes in the congressional districts that resulted in the fighting between the two currently sitting for the same position.
Recently, Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb has been battling Pittsburg's re-elected district - winning a position in another district in a special spring election.
Lamb is running against another current sitting Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently a representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is really the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after a judgment by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old districts were manipulating against the basic law in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th initiated a campaign funding battle between the main party's finance branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a special election in March watched by many for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The Republican held that position for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave Democrats very little.
U.S. Sentenced to El Salvador for Support in China, Then Retreats
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a neat meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners ousted Trump's governing body.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million aid from the United States in 2017, have only been considered, including for narcotic controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed penalties, which include financial aid trails and targeted visa restrictions, would have been extremely painful for the country in Central America and the high level of unemployment and execution there.
As internal meetings progressed, officials of North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow a similar one-year meeting that was seen as a step forward towards preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending with any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new strict message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition that they would not be named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outsider prosecutor close to the administration and also spoke on condition that he would not be named.
Learning the History
What will happen next is the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on a possible prevention of justice, which now has plenty of evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is now turning his investigation into whether Trump's campaign in Russia has conspired to attack our elections.
If the holder of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility for this branch, as he prepares to re-election, and perhaps eventually face a jury made up of his counterparts.
Many if that is, and I'm not saying that the fall of Mr. Trump - or his European counterparts - is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have many decisions that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next three years of torture.
The movement of history revolves around such points of change in direction, and the unpredictable progress of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump accuses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been troubled since the newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly proposed recording the president and even speculated that the president was not suitable for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' narrative is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in midterms for a Congress to account for Mr. Trump?
If we fell through those trials, the winter of democracy would be long.
But I do believe that we will not fall, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once took over my home as an ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit me the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika mark.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic in the upcoming Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following an impressive board in Spain against Villarreal in the first half of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from coming out of the season to a 2-2 board at Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use that result as a boost to bigger things.
"This is a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game thinking we'd get something and go out with points.
We could have done it in the end, but in general, it could have been a good result.
Maybe they're better in the first half and we're better in the second half.
It was a big night in Europe.
We hope we get three points but the game will be difficult because they have a good result in their last game, but we are supported by people, so I'm sure we will fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself but there's a good feeling in the place right now.
The team was great and the members were really enjoying it; the training was good.
We hope that we will be able to fight now, get rid of last season and be successful."
Women's rights are threatened by the fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in the survey have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people are talking to their family members about it.
About half the number of people in the study Nationwide said they were talking to their wives about the value of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
This can be started here.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't say your wishes in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because these decisions are a big factor in what will be worth.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help answer these expenses or insur yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Adjust your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a proxy for health care so that you can appoint a trusted individual to take care of your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes in case you can't speak.
You should also consider having a power of attorney for your finances.
A trustworthy person chooses to make financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid when you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about allergies and medications?
These details are included in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
"It's not just financial thinking, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare for that plan."
Man shot several times by air rifle in Ilfracombe

The victim, aged about 40, was located with Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as "incidental action."
The victim didn't see him shoot.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With the communications lines broken, officials of agencies providing assistance from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency with more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population is estimated at 299,200 in 2017 by the Regency, which is an administrative region lower in the province.
Fishing and cultivation is the main economic source of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morokali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
The tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, and nine died.
Indonesia is in the quake part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died off the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, which triggered a tsunami that rose 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of areas and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow quake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people recalled the devastation caused by the massive earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
There was no subsequent tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Severe quake strikes the tourist-run island of Lombok, where more than 500 people are killed, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put in temporary distress thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin Arrested on Family Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of torture.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting on family violence and protesting the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman known tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took the phone to her.
Palin was nadetine at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is in custody based on the <0x24>500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked for his defence, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he can go to jail for up to a year and raise <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanour, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time the criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of hurting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged injury.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was subjected to family abuse, interference in reporting family violence, and defiance of weapons while drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife said that Palin hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was first promoted by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent actions to PTSD that came from her service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude tsunami quake triggered and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Electricity was cut and communication lines were damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the centre of Sulawesi in the northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake hit.
Hundreds of people gathered to enjoy the beaches of the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in NYC terror attack
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a cycling road attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which taught people to walk and cycling his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov intended to kill eight victims and "intentionally" to cause serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, which was presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to face the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed against Saipov of 22 perfect along with eight counts of extortion support, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and accused of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of carrying out it as "mal-dull, cruel and core of the same."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade since the Southern District of New York has been persecuted in the case of the death penalty.
Prosecutor Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers but was later sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were hanged after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg was hanged in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekistan's pipeline, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the perfect.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He admitted no offense at 22 perfect.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting the admission for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma caused by these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should govern Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage has promised to "move the army of people" today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that what politicians need is "a lot of pressure" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggests that she should be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out now" if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to reconcile her hatred group was emphasized by the Torys' participation in favor of Staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the premier to keep his Chequers compromise plan running smoothly amid attacks from the Brexit Favorites, those who want to stay and the EU.
Allies insist that he will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite poor reactions - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour to choose between his plan and the 'disruption'.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'dispose Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be peer-to-peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been there, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we need to dump Chequers."
He said: "We don't fight world wars just to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone overlooked proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that Britons have changed their minds and they want to stay.'
The Tory Favor Brexit was also on the march and Andrea Jenkyns said to the announcers: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The public doesn't like Chequers, the Opposition doesn't vote, it doesn't like our party and our activists who walk on the street and elect us.
Please, just forget the Chequers and start listening."
In a preliminary message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers will stay in place if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said the politicians at the rally would have to "get enough pressure" if they planned to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about the trust between us - people - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to quit Brexit and we're here now to tell them 'we're not going to let you do 'that'."
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, who intend to turn away from Brexit.
"We move the army of people in this country that has given us Brexit victory and we will not stop until we are free, self-government, high-level United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in Birmingham marched before a two-hour rally took place in the city centre.
There have been widespread activists waving the flags of Torys Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis has criticized the Conservatives for security issues they suffered in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can put IT systems and all the technology for Canada and more, so that there is no border accompaniment, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just a laugh.
There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider" the running of the presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed his future in a town hall in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting in the area using the town hall format since Trump's seat.
One of the men asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and this includes a woman as president."
A man has been arrested for the death of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La. announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting and murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help identifying the man on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet in the head that he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defends his friend and Simpson shoots him.
Simpson is questioned and admits he was in the crime scene, has a handful of weapons, and admits he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the world title after team orders give him the win from Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas has made it clear from the moment he qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team order will play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defensive position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to join his teammates.
Vettel first stopped at the pit and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the end of the group, something that should have decided on the result.
Mercedes hit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the interception where the Ferrari driver hesitated to leave the inside for free risk of continuing to be impeached after a double-move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he led a large part of the race as he continued to run to target a fast finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
He eventually stopped pitting in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up his run in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It's been a difficult day because Valtteri did a good job all weekend and really made me a gentleman and gave me a hand.
"The team has done a great job of getting one-two," Hamilton said.
The Body’s Really Bad Movement ‘Yan
President Donald Trump denounced Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for his insistence that he did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president indirectly provided testimony by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "cruel and evil and lying."
"It's something that can happen and what's good happened in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry and cruel and bad and lying," he said.
"When you see what's going on and what's going on, they say, 'ah, I'm not the one doing it.'
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get baptized?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who baptized."
Just wait.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he added, as the senator imitated.
Feinstein received the letter with details of allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had been revealed.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he asked."
But his former rejection of the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "I tell you, it's really bad body movements.
He probably didn’t do it, but ‘that’s the worst body movement I’ve ever seen.’
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who is hurting, who they can afford to get power," the Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned home to defeat the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two early goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored the home side before Dwyer returned only the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals scored the victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third-round Elite League win of the season, coming from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth season of the two sides, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer's opener entered the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave the assist as Beauvillier doubled just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan returned home side to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's lockdown at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side met again and Bouchard kicked them out again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee only for the first time in the game in the final second period and ensured his team's fifth-half win until the final season.
The Giants, now three out of four of their last five games, returned home and headed for Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed While Ensuring Hundreds of Flights Survive Earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller was called a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
The aftershocks continued to shake the area and many were stranded in the devastated buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the sprawling control tower at Petiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu airport.
He left to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then, he jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are shattered by this news," he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, because according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is believed to be rising because more bodies are under the collapsed buildings while others are not reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palu to hold a plural funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance carrying bodies.
There is not enough clean water.
Small stores were stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is working hard in Indonesia to help survivors but we don't know what they will see there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every evacuation work.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first part of this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crashes in lake
The airline said today that the plane crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia with one man missing, after first stating that all 47 passengers and personnel were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and personnel after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“That’s a really good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to walk in the water to the waist to emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and screaming, and that he had sustained minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said it also helped rescue sailors who repaired the port nearby by using an explosive boat to take people to the shore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered with PNG over the past two decades but have not been involved with Air Niugini.
A woman's life-sustaining life timeline is set on fire
The prosecution ended its argument on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of life-burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to tap into the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis Chambers was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting Tellis' earlier statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that the man's cell phone was already with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "living, because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistencies were Tellis's remarks that he had known Chambers about two weeks after his death.
According to mobile phone records, they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information on his phone.
"He's got the girl in his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury trial to go on that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The three hip hops want to challenge a negative outlook on the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, which is from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its political messages and response to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-start the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have re-started in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
A woman in NY sued a couple for letting her work after a racist text
A New York girl is suing the couple for ice-creaming dismissal after receiving a wrong text from her mother complaining that she is "black again."
The couple denied that they were racists, and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black man when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"HINDIIIIIIII IT NAME," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her text to her husband.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he was able to send it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was accused of mistaking Ms. Maurice's former cousin, who was an African-American, and expected him to be a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day at work and was sent home to Uber.
Currently, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for decommissioning, and asks for a payment of <0x24>350 a day for a six-month, stay-in job he would have, although there is no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know this is discrimination."
The couple returned to allegations that they were racist, saying that removing Maurice from work was reasonable, fearing they could not trust him after they hurt her feelings.
"My husband sent me a message that he didn't really want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's wife told the Post.
"Do you trust your children to a person who has been abused, even if it is not intentional?
Your newborn baby?
It’s not ‘no.’
While comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said that it was only two months after her husband gave birth and that "the situation was very difficult."
"You're going to kill someone like that?
“It’s not a good thing,” added the investment banker.
As the case continues, the public quickly denounces the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers won't like the talking bear, reveals new letter
Says the letter of Bond's son Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Be still confident even though his work is rejected, he said of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from the little toy bear who wrote the book, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "happy and sad."
He describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that his father is proud of the success in the end.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington is true to him, it's like your son has achieved something: you're proud of them even though you're not the one doing it.
I think that's how he looks at Paddington's success.
Although it was created and his imagination, he then gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I said goodbye to the phone while my son died.
After landing her son was thrown at Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"Call on Nad to say that it's really bad, that there's no hope he's alive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"After that, I received a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And ‘that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I was soon there.
We're with you.
Gradually the efficacy and loss of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping.
He died before it, and “it was all shut down.”
I couldn't help but sit there and wait, as I knew it was all going on.
I can't cry or cry because there are so many families and people around me.
I had to stop everything."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning her son's death, boarded a plane with other passengers - unaware of what he was going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I was just crying, I didn't stop crying.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt too sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know he loves the child."
Ladies who are grieving put cards to stop handcuffs on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one by suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys puts on the Welsh bridge cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis's son Tyler was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is hoping to be a chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
They always say that his smile is good."
So he left the job before he died, because he was "deeply sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it will have an impact."
Ms Davis made cards, "to tell people that they have a place to go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to be quiet - you need someone to talk to."
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends for several years with Ms Davies, was left by Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed," he said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was saddened on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he didn't stick to them."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to accept it: "It was really a huge loss to the family.
We're making fun of each other.
We all have to go ahead and fight."

The next day Brett Kavanaugh suspended as FBI initiates investigation
"I thought, if we were able to do as he asked - an investigation in a limited time, the scope was limited - there would be at least a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid "to disintegrate" that the committee was amidst the party's clearing.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
It's because of their hesitation all the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans fail to succeed, they will be too weak in their attempts to vote for the person they want in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called on the Senators, talking to them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through it he met his wife Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has done its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the vote board and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Defector Countdown 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un sat seven years ago, said a South Korean lawmaker.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the more restrictive border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of human smugglers were big.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea were later offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run by China, which has the longest border in North Korea and is easier to cross than the tightly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and is often forced to return them.
The relationship between the North and the South has already been largely suspended in recent months - which is in fact still hostile.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at delayed negotiations over denuclearisation.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Singapore's Kim Jong-un, when they agreed on general terms for the agreement to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we would never have been able to discredit first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "softly noisy," not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority Chief of Congress Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "quietly noisy" and said that because of her conduct she was not eligible to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman protests like that, they'll say 'quietly noisy,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming on several occasions and crying as she discussed her family and her years in high school.
Since he also condemned the Democrats to the committee, allegations against him were "insulting and coordinating criticism" arranged by liberals infuriated by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, because it showed he was not in favour of Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he denounced the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if he could confirm her, and if the Democrats would get the majority in the Low Assembly.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he's not worthy not only of the Supreme Court, but also of the court he's now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a noisy and extorted person to go to court and we hope to say, 'It's not nice'," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a rational denunciation, overflowing months and years of anger, and he can't release it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I think it’s normal, isn’t it?”
She continued, "A female executive in one area helped me a lot, saying she also cried when she was angry, but she made a way that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think I might be sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he continued.
I think that’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a way of getting rid of anger because they are first misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I cried with unremoved anger, was to grab me to the collar of an older woman - an angry manager I was always afraid of - and pulled me to a staircase.
"Don't let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad you're crying."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, was employed by Gary Hart in his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught up with his wife in a boat called Monkey Business and retreated to the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for her not to think of running for president himself.
“I don’t think so much about that decision,” he told me when he was lying 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another.
One person called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already begun, he had already been abandoned in fundraising, so he promised not to join the match unless he could raise <0x24>2 million.
There is no victory in this battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to the men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a break?" he asked.
When he gave a speech and was announced he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion - thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with the system where it was very difficult to recruit money and target voters instead of delegates, and angered by gender discrimination - so he cried.
"I think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"I think Kleenex was the one who sponsored me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my pencil?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war is going to be better in Beijing
Initial explosions in the trade war between the US and China are rife, and although the conflict is far from over, Beijing may be better off in the long-term conflict between countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing China's major exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
This week's largest increase in new tariffs affecting the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value of goods, which is in fact taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing is retaliating each time, the latest being tariff taxing five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of goods from America.
China has promised to satisfy the U.S. in every move, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be in the near future.
In order for Washington to retreat, it is necessary to surrender to the demands, but publicly bowing down to the US would be a disgrace for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still say that if Beijing moves well, the support of China from U.S. long-term trade war pressures will be positive by lowering the level of ties between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast-paced political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would initiate economic integration in either of the two countries, is more dangerous than what observers once admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate devoted to Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in the country's revival that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country had improved.
"The situation is now more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to work rehabilitation in areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore everyone to normal.
There are already all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left due to terrorism and the only economic measures that target their daily lives and occupations.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people who still live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was open to aid in the resurgence of the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not receive any conditional assistance from countries that supported the revolt.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
There have been six consecutive U.S. triples in Europe and no Ryder Cup has been won in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The tee-shot of US star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty throughout the tournament, crashed into the water in the par-3 16th hole, and he accepted the defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari rose in all his rounds, and became a 1-4 player with a 5-0-0 since the start of the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olegen of Denmark.
World top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have been in his last Ryder Cup game.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia has been the most successful in the tournament of all time with his 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but now I can't stop.
This man has become difficult.
So I am grateful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I was so happy to get the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following European success.
He passed the duty of his countryman John Ram to defeat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in 2<0x26>1 in Sunday's singles game.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles that only seconded to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA have struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was a moment this morning that we had a bit of trouble in Europe.
We fought.
Say hello to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
The game was great for all of his 12 players.
We'll work together again, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 years and am honored to serve as a captain.
You are truly welcome.
They're just better."
Red Tide Update: Concentration on Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general drop in Red Tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, conditions of more bloom patches are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decreased concentration.
The Red Tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles of the coast from the western Pinellas counties to the south of Lee.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County beach, but fewer places than last week.
The Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Average concentrations in or far from Pinellas County's beaches were reported in the past week, low to high concentrations away from Hillsborough County's beaches, background to high concentrations down to Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or far away from the coast of Saraae County.
Breathing irrigations continued to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
There has been no reported respiratory irradiation in the North West of Florida in the past week.
