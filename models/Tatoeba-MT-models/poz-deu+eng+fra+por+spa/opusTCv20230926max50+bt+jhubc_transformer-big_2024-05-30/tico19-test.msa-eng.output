The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirms that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on experiences from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their willingness to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia from an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent was a novel coronavirus, now referred to as the acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date it has been proven that about 80<0x25> of individuals with COVID-19 have mild diseases, e.g. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients are cured.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalized treatment while the remaining 6<0x25> of cases experience critical illnesses that require intensive treatment.
The deaths of patients treated in hospitals due to COVID-19 are about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative COVID-19 incidents in each of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom and compared those countries with Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK to those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 is experiencing further geographical and dynamic transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world at this time according to the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to WHO's definition of cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), of which between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in every country around the world, is derived from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare that data with Italy.
As a proxy for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, therefore taking into account the natural pathways of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and the UK, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of cases in Italy for the period of 31 January-15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The trend in cumulative incidence is stalled by 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally following trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then increased significantly around February 28, 2020 (Additional Materials).
This is mostly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar increase trend for the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional substances).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the same number of cases as Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend of cumulative COVID-19 incidents that are being observed suggests that the pandemic is being transmitted at the same speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and possible case definitions differ in countries as well as different protocols to select patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including follow-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions in Italy described a situation that saw 10<0x25> of patients infected with COVID-19 needing intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the entry of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA level for cases of only 6<0x25> and 1<0x25>, respectively (data is not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, between 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 residents in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
The modeling scenario related to the saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country for the spread of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with <0x3E>90<0x25> risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, was provided in the sixth update of a quick risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Given that so far cases have formed clusters in certain districts in EU/EEA and UK countries, as well as hospitals and intensive care units usually handle populations of clear area focus, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided in Tatanama for regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The country, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the scenario of the gradual community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients infected with COVID-19 requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected territories in Italy.
As stressed in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a quick, proactive and thorough approach is essential to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a constraint approach to a reduction, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their responses accordingly if not implemented earlier.
A quick risk assessment also lists general health care measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that states have the possibility to continue to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce stress on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA national healthcare systems will face an increase in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more contagious and affects more elderly people than adolescents and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about the newly emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and thorough view of the fast-growing research subject.
We will discuss the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that these reviews will help in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory of Chinese people who are urged to stay at home during the holiday season and weeks after the outbreak of a viral novel disease.
The virus was highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and a related disease named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to return home and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warned that COVID-19 is the "number 1 public enemy" and could potentially be stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since its first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of viruses isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in the new and rapidly growing subject area.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, triggered in 2012).
We will also discuss what we know so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important questions.
CoV is traditionally considered a pathogen that is harmless to humans, usually the cause of about 15<0x25> of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high-pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the outbreak of their origins in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe morbidity and mortality rates.
COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, an unknown pneumonia cluster of its origins was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later the CoV series was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread quickly to cities, regions and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections among healthcare staff were reported, indicating that human-to-human infections could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was subject to a lockdown with all public transport services being discontinued.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is developing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is not yet certain.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients gave a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected patients are over 50 years of age, very few are under 20 years of age and only 14 individuals are infected are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily for large, protected viruses that contain a single thread of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genus, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, between all alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid protences form a vesicle containing virions, which are then linked to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> of genetic identities in 10 conjugated samples taken from the original site of the disease, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which happens to be similar to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new concise protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and have IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any domains or motives that work.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of the human ACE2 was entirely at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a complex with the asymmetric B0AT1 amino carrier.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed verification, has been combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug filtration to curb SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and mid-sized hosts
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov originated from bats and were transferred to humans through foxes and camels respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96<0x25> similar to two SAVs such as the SARS from bats called bats bats-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus to cross species barriers to infecting humans remains unknown, and the transmission pathway remains unexplained.
Ji, et al., suggests a snake as a viral carrier from bats to humans involving a homologous recombination in S proteins.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that ant-eating long-formed mammal always used in traditional Chinese medicine, is a potentially intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of genetic homology in CoV found in aging and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1<0x25> difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to find the evidence that concrete is awaiting (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still much unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, pesetic acid, chlorophom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidina, can effectively deactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore thought to be easily attacked by novel viruses.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern identification receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as lectins of type C, receptors such as Toll (TLR), receptors such as NOD (NLR), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).
Although different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and type I interferon cysthesis (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of the viral antigen macrophage.
However, the protein N SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid the immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the adaptive immune response was also against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> T cells and CD8<0x2B> play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
Assistant T cells produce prophylactic cytokines to help defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functioning of T cells by resulting in T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst scenario, failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, based on early clusters, are more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidity and pregnant women.
Being common for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, while preventing those who are infected but have no symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals who are exposed to, or infected by, viruses usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually a major and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without any other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic rhythms, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dispnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed breathing assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dispnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptom.
However, 80<0x25> of them need breathing assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher links by MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) are also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throat (13-25<0x25>) are the main symptoms and respiratory relief has been required for approximately 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of 14 February, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2<0x25> when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the death toll from SARS as of November 2002 was 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95<0x25> interconfidence (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality rates and RO of the disease are shown in Schedule1.1.
The figure above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to be infectious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less fatal than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustering startups often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicles as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected individual or patient in the last two weeks before starting to become ill.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have been cured who are allowed to return from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends warnings to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle and myoglobin enzymes have increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, fibrin degradation products present in the blood, have increased, and the count of lymphocytes has decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilateral spotted shadows or soil glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and rapid fibrosis adversely affects gas exchange.
Type-I and Type-II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces surfactant stages and increases surface tension, while reducing lung ability to expand and increases the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually parallel to the worst stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytes desquamation, the formation of hialin membranes and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes as well as multinucleate syncytic cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with viral and ARDS infection pathologies and similar to SARS and MERS patients pathologies.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction of transcription-inverted polymerase (RT-PCR) has been used as a major criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rates of false negatives, which may lead to an epidemic, clinical manifestations are beginning to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
The same is true with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiology discoveries is important as well as imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/L intricately to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/L less than the time of equipment (10-100 copies per microliter input rod) using.
Hopefully the new technique can significantly increase sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
As a result of lack of experience with CoV novels, doctors can generally provide supportive treatments to COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of previously used or recommended therapies for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who have been cured is recommended for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs at the initial stage and may also attack, at a lower level, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives as well as include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary grafting technique used for the treatment of cardium or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as sepsis shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that cytokine storms result from excessive reactions of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunotinidase is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immune treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restrictions; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial for severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for short periods have been recommended to be used with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antivirus therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective against an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed the possibility of inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mixture to China to carry out a pair of trials against individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects can occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used to the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients who have recovered and generated antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from getting the disease has a long history.
It is true that patients who have recovered usually have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they identify unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma has been collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been injected into 10 patients who are in serious condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced viral inflammation and load as well as increased saturation in the blood.
However, verification and explanation are needed to suggest such methods for large-scale use before specialized therapies are yet to be developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies that are specialized quickly to fight global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or filter effective antibodies against vital viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in different formulas according to the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components remain unknown or blurry as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to a specific and effective lack of therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some regions of China that use TCM in 87<0x25> of their patients, including Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>) and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13<0x25>).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be included in that assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatments only with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms and treatment in hospitals was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic conditions became worse (from light to severe) significantly lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> compared to 46.2<0x25>) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> compared to 39<0x25>).
However, the effectiveness and security of TCM is still awaiting more controlled trials at a greater level and in more centers.
It should be interesting to also describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective components in the treatment of TCM or the combination of such treatment if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a great fear of a disease that is very contagious and can lead to death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phases of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide were also reported.
The detection of mandatory and quarantine contacts, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause people to feel more concerned and guilty about the effects of infections, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people in contact with them as well as the public in need of it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are important to disrupt the transfer chain of infected animals and humans to exposed hosts and usually complement antiviral treatments in epidemic control caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made by developing a protein-based S vaccine to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Directly debilitating vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness in vivo of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and dangerous challenges models and their protection against zoonotic virus infections should be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS has ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of persistent zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using unactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits as well as some have been tested in animal models.
Safe and effective development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because a long period of time (average 18 months) is required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without being re-infected.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas lacking resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurs between the ages of 30-65 with 47.7<0x25> of those over 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 cases mentioned above.
Patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at a median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients' results.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute cardiovascular injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular disease is also a cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be tied to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and disease are intertwined and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to final therapy and healing.
A link to the CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
This enzyme is secreted in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and is removed during tissue damage.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest radiography and the progress of clinical symptoms over time should be considered together with other issues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunotinidases that are commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
High doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As noted above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from overwhelming stress as they often face long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and patient friends.
It is important to provide long-term psychological counseling and support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to a demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to doubling in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can double efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or incubation periods can produce large amounts of the virus while performing daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is thought to occur during severe illness, while most transmissions do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China, including lockdown orders in Wuhan and the surrounding cities and quarantine continues nearly the entire population in hopes of deciding on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are significantly damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling an epidemic slowdown.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end at the end of March and the drop phase will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model for predicting the consequences of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the middle turbine swab and the esophagus of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurring episode like influenza.
However, convincing signals have taken place in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, suggesting that the current strategy may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally managed to control.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, it may be that SARS-CoV-2 infections become weaker and eventually end up or become a less pathogenic virus that exists in conjunction with humans.
Comparisons between the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS are provided below (Rajah (Rajah55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very susceptible to coughing or sneezing, and can also be infected through direct contact with the substance that the virus has contaminated.
The virus is also found in stools, which gives rise to new possibilities of transmission from stool to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health workers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even people on the side of the road who are in contact with the patient or an infected person.
The first line of defenses that can be used to reduce our risk is wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and the use of N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23> 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid drops from infected individuals from spreading through ventilation or sticking to the surface of the material, which can subsequently be spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions that can penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same as SARS-CoV in size where both are about 85 nm in size.
Since viral particles can penetrate five surgical face masks worn together, healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) instead of surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, healthcare workers need to wear self-protection equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes of an inflammatory eye.
In this regard, healthcare workers also need to wear a transparent face protector or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in the affected or potentially affected area, it is advisable for all residents to wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with potentially infected individuals.
The distance of three feet is considered a suitable distance to keep away from the patient.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, high homology of SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 warns China as the SARS outbreak struck in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention tried to alleviate the concerns of its citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and that human reproduction is limited and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
The message managed to alleviate public concerns, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it was not welcome to curb the spread of the outbreak on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China can take precautions from this and make improvements in the future.
For example, appropriate agencies are (1) more cautious in making public announcements as each detail presented affects the attitudes and decisions of the people; (2) more sensitive and reactive to the extraordinary information received from the clinic rather than waiting for a formal report from doctors or officials; (3) more strongly in curbing the outbreak than in militarizing the public; and (4) more frequently conducting training to increase public awareness of the disease.
The transmission of COVID-19 was caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also almost the same as SARS, the transmission of COVID-19 has created the sentiment that the SARS outbreak has recurred.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in curbing the epidemic and treating patients.
Covid-19 affects people older than young people and affects men more than women, the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than youth.
SARS has a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 (10.91<0x25> versus 1.44<0x25>).
Covid-19 patients can spread the virus without any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in an ill condition, which results in difficulty in curbing the transmission of COVID-19 versus SARS.
This explains the causes of SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The results of RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered can be found positive for the virus again.
These findings indirectly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Based on the rapid progress in the study on COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96<0x25> of genetic homologists are found on SARS-CoV-2 and two coVs like SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is also derived from bats.
Is there an animal that is an intermediate species that spreads the virus from home, for example bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively decide the transmission, and the outbreak can repeat at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can the virus actually enter the airway cells and subsequently result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does this virus develop genetically through transmission among humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, eradicated like SARS or recurring periodically like the flu?
This is important but it will take time to find answers to the above questions and various other questions.
However, regardless of the expenses that will be claimed, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have been driving the evolution of the joint coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as the flu.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed views and revealed how HCoV is devastating and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has attracted attention to CoV and surprised us with its simple but less pathogenic infection compared to SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis and an understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non pathogenic bats.
Intermediate reservoir hosts for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
An investigation into the interaction of CoV hosts in animals enables the importance of understanding about CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of existing knowledge related to seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discoveries as well as the zoonotic origins and transmissions between species.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
Epidemic diseases during COVID-19 are discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange and implications for the evolution of the virus to the severity of the disease are also confirmed.
Coronavirus (CoV) is from the family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of single-seamed, positive-brimmed RNA viruses.
The length of this genome is between 26 and 32 kilobase and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological form that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that shares the same arrangement.
It is estimated that two-thirds of these genomes have two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which then translates to pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicase.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remainder of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including papakus (S), covers (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some specific protein accessories are also coded according to different customers of CoV.
Based on protein sequence differences, CoV is classified into four genera (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where beta-CoV genera are composed of most HCoVs and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rats act as a source of genes to most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs for gama-CoVs and delta-coVs.
For thousands of years, CoV has surpassed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, 7 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually result in moderate symptoms, such as flu and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with high probability of developing acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients suffering from the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which result in symptoms of self-control.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until the SARS outbreak appears.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the worst destructions in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread around the world.
The 2019 HCoV novel (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is a leading agent for the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings have been given and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, rats and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCov from bats, where the virus is easily adaptable and non- pathogenic but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The detection of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for the understanding of natural history, driving force and restriction factors for species leaps.
It may also drive and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries and producers for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of overflows in the future.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we outline and discuss a common theme where the HCoV virion is not pathogenic in the host's natural reservoir but becomes pathogenic after the transmission of interspecies to the new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary direction of HCoV, where increased transmission often appears with pathogenic reductions.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of a cold patient, different CoVs have been isolated in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the historical findings of HCoV in the chronological rules (Table 1) can provide information and teaching.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients suffering from germ infections in the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow inside the line of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, lethargy and sore throats, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and subsequent serial quotations in the brain of breastfeeding mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is similar to that of HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to infect more during winter in temperate areas.
Usually, the duration of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild common colds.
Only a few immunocompromising patients indicate a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-recorded HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, the third found HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the super-spreaders, it is estimated that each case can cause about two secondary cases, with a duration of incubation between 4 to 7 days and a viral-free peak appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show myalgia, headaches, fever, dedar and cold, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as symptoms of late.
Lymphophenia, a test of circulating liver function and increased creatine kinase are normal laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell breeding and increased macrophage are also noted in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30<0x25> of patients then need mechanical treatment and ventilation.
In addition to infections in the lower respiratory tract, various organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can lead to death especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a brother to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been made for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, the virus was found to be widespread among children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7<0x25> of normal respiratory diseases and the peak time of the disease occurs is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as a group.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis infected in the community, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbations.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four infected HCoVs in this community have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of the more harmful subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally speaking, when this HCoV acquires the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory originated in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS match SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from acute kidney failure, which so far is unique to MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-certified cases have been reported with a high death of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruses to hit humans.
During mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients who are retrospectively known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infections was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared an outbreak of a lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an International Public Health Emergency and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a rough death of 3.4<0x25>.
The death toll in cases in Hubei, China is 4.2<0x25>, while the death toll outside the area is 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, coughing and dispnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly escalate into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the homology of the high sequence of nucleotides by 82<0x25>, the virus grouped into different branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid transmission worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the time of incubation and the duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In one sense, SARS-CoV-2 infections show more frequent features during infections with HCoV found from the community, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in cases of SARS-CoV infections, although the ratio is slightly low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows an attractive pattern feature for both the HCoV found from the community and the SARS-CoV.
In one sense, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV found in the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to verify whether the infection of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after being passed through humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether oral stool transplantation for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain conditions awaiting enlightenment through future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be triggered according to the season as in the case of infected HCoV in the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 include infection, pathogenicity and continued spread after human transmission will affect the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs infected in the community cause mild symptoms have been adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the past HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes severe diseases in humans and people with severe HCoV, has been eliminated.
To enable this to happen, HCoV must be doubled in humans to a sufficient degree to allow the collection of adaptive mutations that counteract the factor of host restriction.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people infected, the greater the chances for the virus to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four infected CoVs in the circulating community in human populations, triggering common colds in immunocompromised subjects.
The virus does not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and the transmission of the virus in humans cannot be maintained.
The virus must remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoir and seek opportunities to spread to easily infected human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate hosts and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same features as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four infected HCoVs in the community.
It is very contagious as HCoV is infected in the community, at least at this time.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than the community-infected HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will be fully adapted to humans and spread among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origins of animals that cause HCoV, it is better to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and reproductive host HCoV.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close heir who shares high homology at the level of a sequence of nucleotides.
Hereditary viruses usually adapt well and are not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host keeps HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or its virion.
On the other hand, if the new HCoV is introduced to the intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source for human infections and plays the role of breeding host by allowing the virus to multiply temporarily and then spreading the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infections.
HCoV can develop a dead road infection if it is unable to maintain its infection in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create long-term deficiencies.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals responsively that SARS index cases have a history of contact with prey animals.
Further seroprevalens investigations show that animal sellers have higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG prevalences than the general public.
The lamari (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were first identified to carry a virus like SARS-CoV that is almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly by the fact that no SARS was reported again after killing all foxes in the market.
However, it has been reported that lantern weasels from forests or farms without exposure to live animal markets are mostly SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that lantern weasels may only host a strengthening intermediate but not a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Most notably, since 80<0x25> of different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also host reinforced intermediaries for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of this seems to be a dead road host for SARS-CoV.
Further searches for natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) Rhinolophus bats associated with SARS, which exists in Chinese bats.
The bat is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study has provided the basis for a new concept that bat hoses produce human pathogens.
Some CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than one named WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) exchange enzyme is known as the recipient for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from bat stool samples was shown using bats, feathers and human ACE2 as recipients for cell entry.
More interestingly, SARS patients who are recovering are found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related offspring for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95<0x25> of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same host receptor, the 4-peptidyl peptidase (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA polymerase sequence relies on the RNA of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in the beta-CoV of the identified bats from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest families of CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels have a positive effect on MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, just like camels in the Middle East originating from various African countries.
The living MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans has been isolated through an Arab camel's nasal swab, which in turn indicates that the camel serves as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that generally the symptoms are moderate but large decay of the virus has been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the stool-mouth pathway, which is also a pathway for viruses to be released from bats.
However, the question remains since many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms begin, possibly associated with human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown spread pathways involving an unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> of homologic nucleotides with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the irregularity of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
Granted, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 unless a nearly similar bat CoV is found in the future.
Perhaps, the intermediate animal host to SARS-CoV-2 is of a wild species sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is associated with many early cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possible event of the spread of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence have suggested that a group of threatened small mammals known as Tenggiling (Manis javanica) may also store beta-CoV offspring associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of CoV tendgiling shares 85-92<0x25> of the homology of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90<0x25> of the identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped in two subgenerations of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RDB) to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4<0x25> of the amino acid sequence identity.
In tangible differences, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more distorted, despite having higher degrees of homology of genome-wide sequences.
Preliminary studies of infected tenggiles also reported the detection of the virus contagion from lung samples, which were later found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a collection method and selected a manual stack to generate part of the semi-sequence of the genome that comprises about 86.3<0x25> of the full viral genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that tengalling is one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from Tenggiling due to the irregularity of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, hangers and other mammals still need to be established.
Whereas the highest homology sequences have been found in RBD between SARS-COV-2 and Tenggiling, beta-CoV is associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide homology.
Strong speculation suggests that the high-level equations between RBD from beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by a concentrated evolution of choice.
A counter-recommendation favors a re-combination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving force, re-enumeration occurs widely in beta-CoVs.
Studies are still being conducted about the direct zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been derived from bat CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 virions have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a three-color North American bat showed close ties to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while the camelid has also been suspected of being an intermediary host.
To be clear, the current knowledge of the animal origins of HCoV is known to be formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But alpha-CoV bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is alpha-coV.
Some lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Secondly, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non- pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca triggers respiratory diseases in animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the alkaline alpha-CoV is obtained by humans from HCoV-229E.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although alpha-CoV bats become the base of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and Arab camels may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of the transmission between species from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the beginning of the introduction and has been reinforced with subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide the depths of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long-lived, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all encouraging conditions for bats to become the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to Arab camels for decades.
It adapts well to these camels that have switched from intermediate hoses to stable and natural reservoir hoses.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is involuntary and man remains the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the camel's function in the spread of MERS-CoV, the function of tangiling, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, beta-CoV tendgiling is highly pathogenic in tendogiling.
They may be the final host for SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2, the same as the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, Tenggiling can be one of the newly identified intermediate amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughter and feed on hunted animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A review of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both bats and hangillers.
Animal origin search for SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of host animals, the three main factors in the part of the virus are also important in facilitating CoV to cross species barriers.
First, relatively their rate of mutation is high in RNA replication.
Compared to single-seam RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be considered "simple" to "high" with an average exchange rate of <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the novel host.
CoV has exoribonucleas of proofreading, its suppression leads to very high vulnerability and weakening or perhaps even the absence of life force.
Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogues are known to suppress CoV doubling through this exoribonuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV does not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high rates of mutation, the rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high level of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps it has adapted to other hosts close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the Arab camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic shifts will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional plasticity in genome changes for mutations and recombinations, while increasing the likelihood of joint evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of CoV novels when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a unique open reading framework that is abundant and protein functions are encoded towards the end of the 3' genome.
Third, CoV switches templates randomly and frequently during RNA duplication through a unique "tiru-choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixed container, yarn exchange occurs frequently during transcription of RNA CoV.
Highly homologous subgenomous and full RNA can be recombined to produce a new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence of fusion has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of the host virus is related to the transmission.
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, the re-combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choices during the transmission event between species.
Based on a comparative analysis between human impairment and SARS-CoV weasel, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD on S proteins.
Generally, the RBD on the S protein in CoV interacts with the cells and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid in S1 debris, which binds to human ACE2 as well as a joint receptor for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, weed, rats and raccoons, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed as distinct from the deposition of human viruses and foxes in RBD and 4 of them are located within the receptor binding motive for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The weasel SARS-CoV has a mutation of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the linkage of trace protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
30<0x25> of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units of S proteins impacts that the bonds of this protein S link to human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM research suggests this bond linkage is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors that exist, such as N aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O terasetyl cyalic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after the transmission between species from its animal host.
In addition to cellular receivers, the consequence of transmission between HCoV species also depends on the dependence of the host and other obstruction factors.
The difference between human and HCoV's natural reservoir hoses such as bats, Arab camels and rodents may create barriers to transmission between species.
HCoV needs to capture the hoses' dependence factor and subvert the hoses' restriction factor for the transmission between successful species.
In this case, the molecular determinants in important areas of these virus-hos interactions are still unidentified and characterized.
Unbiased genome-environment filters for hoses dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may yield results.
HCOV novel: Back to the beginning
The diversity of bats CoV provides an extensive opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this regard, coV bats act as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, acquisition or loss of novel protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been deemed important in adapting to humans, as the SARS-CoV-related bat virus has been isolated but it was found to encode the ORF8 spiking protein.
The feature of the nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV blackout has been found in isolated strains at the onset of a human epidemic.
This blackout separates the ORF8a into the ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered a customization mutation that promotes the exchange of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma descendants, of which a large number of smaller recombined areas have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
The recombined location is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to be experiencing a recombinational occurrence between different descendants, which occurs in Saudi Arabian camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination incidence was also observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoV recombine with other animal CoVs in non-structured genes.
A warning should also be given that false selection can contribute to an accidental change in the viral genome, which is most likely to result from liberating the virus from the pressure of the applied selection, such as by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 in the prototype thread HCoV-229E, as a result of the elimination of two nucleotides.
While strong ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka displays single nucleotide insertion, which results in skeletal displacement.
Finally, the evolution of HCoV novels was also driven by the pressure of selection in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms alone have been detected when bats are infected with CoV, marking a joint adjustment between CoV and bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV both anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats efficiently reduces pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is restricted due to increased regulation of NKG2/CD94's natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression for the major histocompatible class 1 complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity bats can both resist CoV multiplication and affect proof readings by exoribonuclease, while also providing selective pressure for the treatment of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for hoses adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three HCoV novels have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hoses such as bats and camels.
It doubles quickly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret causes of asymptomatic carriers are seen and the cause of severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the worse the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been disbanded from CoV multiplication.
The same strategy that dissolves the immune response may have a beneficial effect in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflamasom in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflamasom with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common themes of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also coV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While foxes and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
A highly homologous beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicating that a tangling may be one of the intermediate hosts or a beta-CoV that can contribute gene debris to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was produced by humans intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV has returned to focus as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has drastically changed our views on the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Complete evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origins from bats and are transferred to humans through intermediate hoses.
Since SARS-CoV infections are caused by human contact with wetworms on the market, shutting down wet markets and killing wet wet weeders should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, wet markets should be removed to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multigenerational beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the gangiling and other mammals need to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in Arab camels for a long time.
This camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and fur products for the local community.
These camels are found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it is admitted in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-infection of the MERS outbreak, a thorough approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot get rid of this virus, new genotypes may appear to cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are scattered in the forest.
In particular, the coV bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and rejoin, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or can kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparations and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet a long time ago.
The virus remains in a natural reservoir until there is a chance of infection.
While bats have many features that facilitate the spread of the virus, human chances of having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if society is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoonosis is by humans avoiding natural reservoir ecology for zoonotic viruses.
Some of the questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered.
Firstly, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 inherited virus to tengulls, it's definitely interesting to see how bats and tengulls can share the same ecological nic.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we must determine how humans get in contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and hangillins needs to be explained.
Finally, given that many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and infections must experimentally be carried out.
Whether bats, hangers or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar hamph virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of "suspicious cases" and "verified cases" for COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), and these guidelines provide our experience of being a good reference to fighting this worldwide pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are slowly improving based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a review of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest Covid-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus novel (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO announced COVID-10 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice guidelines and that guide has been published in Military Health Research Feb. 06, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge increases slowly based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies to be updated continuously.
As an example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have issued a total of seven editions with some contexts altered essentially.
Now our guidelines receive reviews by Zhou et al., they introduce simple scoring recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and thank them.
However, their efforts also require updates according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition of the trial) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case requires a combination of any one item of epidemiological historical characteristics with two items of clinical manifestations to produce a thorough analysis, or it is necessary to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and other neighborhoods, or communities where cases of COVID-19 are reported within 14 days before symptoms begin; (2) the history of contact with the infection of the SAR-CoV-2 case (with positive tests of nucleic acids); (3) the history of the period of contact with the patient before fever or other periods of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period, the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cells shows normal, deterioration, or a decreased count of lymphocytes in the early stages.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should rest on a suspected case with any one pathogenic item or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire genome of the virus shows high homogeneity to a known positive novel of the coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM intestinal antibodies or IgG antibodies in the SARS-Co.
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples were added to the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood samples has been included in the fourth editions (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and then serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support bringing positive results of specific antibodies into the criteria that have been confirmed.
In addition, there is a growing number of evidence that reminds us to be cautious with typical or asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, flow charts from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and invite readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "verified cases", we recommend tracking and complying with the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest mortality rate in a day caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Survey (IEDCR) reported a total number of recorded infections including 114 active cases and 33 home-seated recoveries.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Merjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr Merjady, two cases are over 60, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 as a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, Anadolu Agency, that one of the sick was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport was originally started on March 26 and is planned to expire on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medicines, oil and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
The sign of this level was present on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea has claimed, as of Thursday, that it is among several countries that are free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours ahead of 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS news reports, citing data from Johns Hopksins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, Moscow's city chief, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russian people may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; the vote was confirmed with 215 votes in favor, ten exceptions, and one opposition.
Saudi Arabia extended the order of confinement in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to the whole day; earlier, the order of confinement was only carried out between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to execute a lockdown order between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended its residential order until May 1.
Australia's stores have lowered the limit of toilet paper once a transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, the Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet wipes to two and one packets of one transaction each at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This limit was broadcast as an order on the exit list, and on the Facebook page of that chain.
Buyers reportedly buy stocks due to COVID-19 fears if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery purchases to one packet per order.
This change followed a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the implementation of a four-pack ban, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales increased in "sudden increases" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packages last week.
To continue to alleviate shortcomings, Coles booked packages larger than suppliers and increased frequencies of delivery, Woolworths booked additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks for special Wednesday plans available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects an increase in the cost of the product, when the supplier tries to meet the demand, and a little special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the initial production of stocks, some stores could not run a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores filled stock every night.
He told toilet tissue was a large item, leading to a low quantity on the volume of stock, and, when sold out, left the spacious rack space empty, reinforcing the feeling of lack.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there are a variety of items on the shelves, if products such as toilet wipes and disinfectants can be [bought] and have quantities, you will likely reduce the panic of Russell Zimmerman on ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday's manufacturers of toilet wipes recycling producers Who Gives a Crap they have run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Wipes, and Solaris Paper who made Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered toilet wipes for free to first bidders at an auction session in Melbourne, when a small auction was held as buyers faced off-time during the Labour Day holidays.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Stores initially refused to impose sanctions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, which saw them say they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, dehydration materials, dry foods, hand washing and flooring.
As well as outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres' toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) was on the verge of a COVID-19 outbreak — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to how dangerous the particular case is, the WHO is aware of the need to urge the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If the country is tracking, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and moving its people to action, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general.
We are very concerned about both the level of contagious transmission and the severity of worrying and the level of anxiety.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from emergence to ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we've never before seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to announce the outbreak as an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "shortly, things will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was announced as a General Health Emergency at the International Level on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate of cases has been estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide between 13.04<0x25> in Algeria to .08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two and fourteen days.
No specific antivirus or antivirus treatments are known.
The main treatments are symptomatic therapy and support. Suggested preventive measures include washing the hands, closing the mouth during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring as well as self-isolation for those who suspect themselves of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, lockdown orders, hazard control at work and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused global socioeconomic disruption, suspension or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of supply driven by panic-buying.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or at the local level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Wrong information about the virus has spread online, and there have been xenophobia and discrimination incidents against Chinese, others of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearances, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reductions in travel and heavy industry closures, there is a decrease in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of those cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and cause the virus to be suspected of having a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, a pangilling coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person to experience the symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no visible relationship with the subsequent wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, during the first new cases reported in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Koea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and below equaling 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60<0x25> of the British population should be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been tested positive according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have had an official policy of not testing only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections have not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections are a source for 79<0x25> of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the increase in number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the period of development of symptoms until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths are among those over the age of 60, and 75<0x25> have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count of the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the dead who have tested positive for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in the care center, etc.
Separate data from Italy found that the number of over deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the number of deaths stated] is less approximation", a statement backed by a subtle report on less counts in the U.S. Such estimates are frequent in the pandemic, as during the 2020 H1N1 swine flu epidemic in January 2009 H1N1. The first confirmed death in Wu 9.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia were in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, in every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been used predominantly to specify the quantity of deaths.
These figures vary by area and by time, as well as are influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality ratio with the case illustrates the number of deaths divided by the amount of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality ratio with global cases was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by area.
In China, estimates for mortality rates with cases decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for those with symptoms starting January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for those with symptoms beginning after February 1, 2020). Other measurements include the death rate of cases (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed with uninfected diseases, and the rate of death of infections (IFR), which depicts the percentage of those infected.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow a specific population of infections through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The top estimates for this range are consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies analyzing the effects of tests on CFR estimates.
The WHO insists that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and peak times of the outbreak are uncertain and can vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Allowed unchecked, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to deteriorate when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable projections right now about the time the situation will happen."
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be moved to comply with WHO's advice on measures to stop the transmission of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Drugs stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, perhaps for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it's so contagious—will disappear completely" and that it "may be a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The urgency of the reappearance will depend on the immunity of the group and the stage of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and the infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, cold, vomiting, hemoptisis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become very ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms of emergency as persistent breathing, pain or stress on the chest, shocking confusion, difficulty waking up, and eyes or lips becoming bluish; immediate medical treatment is advised if these symptoms of death are present. The increase in the disease can further lead to severe constipation, acuary dystrophy syndrome, acuous dym.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to the infected person should be closely monitored and examined to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates an asymptomatic ratio ranging from slight to 44<0x25>.
The period of normal incubation (the time between infection and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.For example, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell initially 30<0x25> and then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small droplets resulting during coughing, sneezing, or speaking; with close contact is at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughing will cause the ai droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets that remain for longer periods of time in the air, which may be generated during speech. Breathing drops may also be produced during releasing, including during speech, even though the virus is generally not airborne.
The droplet can land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or may be sucked into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to spray and therefore result in airborne spread.
The virus can also spread when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of stools to the mouth of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most susceptible to infection during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the infection may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease until three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission can occur before the presence of significant symptoms.
Few asymptomatic cases have been confirmed in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the contact detection investigation.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not so clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three others. The virus remains for hours to days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on carton, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have ever tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise that they wash their hands after touching an animal, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with clusters of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective sheath.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (derived B) along with two threads obtained from bats.
The virus is 96<0x25> similar at the genome level full of other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequence between the viruses from the gangiling with the virus from the human.
The overall genome difference to date has found that at least 92<0x25> of genetic material is shared between the Tenghiling Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that it is intermediate.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although the inducement eventually through transcription of reverse polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR) for infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specifically, with most of its imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being issued on January 17.
The test used reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
These tests can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is carried out with nasopharyngeal swab but throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use by laboratories only certified.
Feature imaging features on radiographs and computerized tomography (CTs) for symptomatic oangs include asymmetric peripheral glass relief and absence of pleural efusion.
The Italian Radiologic Association is gathering an interbanga online database to find imaging for confirmed cases.
As a consequence of intercourse with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR's authentication tnpa imaging has limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infections, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting considerations of the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect virus imaging cii with both radiograph and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining good self-hygiene overall, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on tissue and putting the tissue directly into the trash container.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised to avoid all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who take care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method to determine the source of the infection and to avoid further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement requesting limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to close a user with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Wrong responses are circulating about ways to prevent infections; for example, rinsing the nose and mouthwashing with a dessert is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop the vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the plague.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by a home soap, which destroys its protection bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation with at least 60<0x25> alcohol by content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to decontamination for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71<0x25> ethanol, 50–100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5<0x25> povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chrohexidina gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or daily care centers, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by the sick, should be decommissioned.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouth and nose with bent arms or tissue during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of the exhalation drops travel scattered while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the time and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of people with COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have started promoting the use of face masks by members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made from fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community members, especially when in close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask while using public transport or in a crowded area.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering a person's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has decreed that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid-March, asked intercity train and bus passengers to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has been obliged to wear a face mask when it comes out, while also recommending making a face mask at home for those who cannot buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social imprisonment (also known as physical imprisonment) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using touchless greetings, and physically separating themselves from others.
Many governments are now obliging or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the rally recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune system face an increased risk of serious illnesses and complications as long as the intercourse of the CDC is the same as it has been advised to stay at home as much as possible in an area with an epidemic. "At the end of March 2020, WHO and the body
The use of the term "social imprisonment" has led to the implication that people should undergo full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to become negligent in relation to others through alternative means. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes suggestions to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been suggested to those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or proposed self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected area.
The most decisive self-quarantine directives have been issued to those who belong to high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
Strategies for controlling outbreaks are stemming or oppressing, and reduction.
Containing is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected and introduce other infection control measures and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the transmission of the disease, efforts then move to the level of emissions: measures are taken to slow the transmission and reduce its impact on the healthcare system as well as the community.
A combination of constraints and reduced measures may be carried out at the same time.
Stress requires a more decisive step to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic breeding to less than 1. A part of the population managing the transmission of infectious diseases is trying to lower the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services being overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage transmission include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large-scale gathering events; the intervention of China's intervention to encourage the reception and participation of the whole intervention; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning the surface.
Other countries also take various targeted measures to limit the transmission of the virus.
South Korea introduced massive screenings and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who are quarantining themselves and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that reductions (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and emphasis (reversing epidemic growth) had major challenges.
The optimal reduction policy may reduce healthcare demands peaking to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to be burdened.
The runway can be an option but needs to be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if it comes first), as the spread will immediately bounce back when preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Eating a cold medicine that is given on the counter, drinking water and resting will help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the consequences.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also noted that some "traditional and home treatments" can provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and healthcare adaptation for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a basic step in response to the outbreak.
ECDC and European regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for major hospitals and healthcare services to move resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures when necessary, separating and isolating positive COVID-19 patients, as well as increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and available beds.
There are various theories about where the first case (called an empty number patient) came from.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei slowly increased.
The case is mostly associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus is derived from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origins. The unidentified pneumonia cluster was observed on December 26 and was treated by Zhang Jixian doctor at the Hubei Regional Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, have been warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, has been scolded by his superiors for evoking this.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger investigations in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubles approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other areas of China, aided by Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan into major transport hubs and railway exchanges.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and exercised border control.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantine (known as home sitting orders, shelter directives, or emergency) and lockdown orders.As of April 2, almost 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are under a form of emergency in the United States, more than 50 million people are in emergency in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in emergency in South Africa and 1.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in an emergency form, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID 19 was traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggested the earliest case was on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases on December 26, then his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic tests for patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of coronaviruses such as SARS.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was announced on the same day.
During this notice, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission to humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by China's Communist Party chief secretary <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
Under circumstances that have been dubbed the "largest quarantine in human history", a quarantine siege was announced on January 23 that stopped travels into and out of Wuhan, which has extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebration (January 25) has been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of the temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was later built, the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also renovated 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government began its next step to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holidays.
Schools and universities across the country are also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau began several steps, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Working from a distance has begun in some parts of China.
Travel restrictions are designed inside and outside of Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) face some type of external restrictions. After the transmission entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has enforced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, the mainland of China was only one case of spreading in the country within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the cases of widespread domestic transmission were essentially blocked and the transmission was controlled by China.
The same day travel restrictions have been eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the emergency was enforced. The Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister announced on March 26, 2020 that entry through visa or resident permit holders will be suspended from March 28 onwards, without specific details on the timing of this policy.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and the preparation of financial stimulus packages to firms. The State Council declared the day of mourning beginning with three minutes of silent time at 10:00 p.m. 4 April, coincident with the Qingming Festival, although the federal government asked families to show respect online as complying with physical distancing to avoid the repeated COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to be transmitted to South Korea on January 20, 2020, from China.
The national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely linked to a rally in Daegu from a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji adherents who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the cause of transmission.
As of February 22, among the church’s 9,336 followers, 1,261 people or about 13<0x25> reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level warning on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, up to 3,150 cases on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule is also affected and therefore the schedule is changed. South Korea introduces a program that is considered to be the world's most organized and scalable program to filter populations to detect the virus, and isolate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine the people they relate to.
Filter methods include compulsory self-reporting of the sympton by new international arrivals through mobile apps, past-guided virus testing with results available the next day, and improved test capability allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak even though it did not quarantine the entire city. South Korean society initially split for President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans signed a petition to either claim Moon's dismissal on matters they claimed to have been blamed by the government on the outbreak, or praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of cases a day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that starting April 1 all new overseas arrivals would be quarantined for two weeks.
As reported by the media on April 1, South Korea has received requests for help testing the virus from 121 different countries.

Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although crowded intercity traffic before Nowruz's Persian New Year continued.
Shia meals in Qom remained open to visitors until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.

A CNN report notes that a combination of Italy's crowded elderly population and the inability to test all infected with the virus to date may be contributing to high mortality rates.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most peacefully affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for seeing less rapidity and earnestness in its response to the concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an advisory announcement to avoid all unimportant travel and social contact, suggesting people working from home when possible and avoiding places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.

South Korea has criticised "an obscure and passive quarantine effort" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on a site determined by the government.
South Korean society was initially unclear with President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition asking for Moon's dismissal of what was deemed to be the government's mishandling of the outbreak, or praised his response. The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in return.
Some commentators have voiced concerns that the action would allow the government to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow prime minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree permanently, suspend parliament and elections and punish those who were deemed to have spread misinformation about the virus and handled the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus outbreaks have been blamed for several incidents of supply shortages, resulting from the use of equipment to fight the growing outbreaks around the world, panic purchases, and disruptions to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand as well as supplier disorders.
Several areas also saw panic purchases that caused slippery shelves of essential items such as food, toilet wipes, and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology industry has especially warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to a delay in supply of medical items over four to six months.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would harm the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has led to a shortage of infant formulas in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Behind the prevalence of high COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan province, as well as the constant high demand for food products, both regions have survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to fight the accumulation of essential goods and sales of goods have been successful, avoiding severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural production has not seen a significant reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks only take place temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials release pig stockpiles to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
The same law exists in Italy requires food manufacturers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to control the transmission of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5<0x25>.
Since mainland China is a major economic and production hub, the virus outbreak has been seen as a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will remain downward until a clearer image emerges of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts concluded that the economic collapse due to the epidemic of the world's growth could have surpassed the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis gave an impact of <0x24>300<0x2B> billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "disturbed" after a drop in oil prices due to lower demand than China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On Feb. 27, due to increased concerns about coronavirus transmission, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industry Average reported the worst fall since 2008, with the Dow 1,191 points falling, the biggest fall in a day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, the GmbH Scope Assessment confirmed China's credit rating capability, but maintained a Negative Survey.
Stocks fell out of fear of the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many people think there will be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central and state banks.
The central banks responded faster than they did during the 2008 financial turmoil.
Tourism is the sector most severely affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the government's recommendation not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional airlines in British Flybe have been buried.
The impact on the cruise ship industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic occurred by accident during Chunyun, a massive travel season associated with Chinese New Year holidays.
Several public involving events have been cancelled by the state and provincial government, including the annual New Year festival, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and festivals in traditional temples.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extend the New Year's holiday to Feb. 10, ordering all workplaces not to be reopened until that date.
The region represents 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong raises the level of disease infection response to the highest level and declares emergency, closes schools until March and cancels New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been globally impressed, with a reduction in business time or temporary closure.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle East retailers saw a 50-60<0x25> fall.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> drop in traffic walking to the shopping mall in March versus February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world are implementing additional measures, for example improving hygiene, installing heat scanners to check the temperature of visitors, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-driven recession could cause an additional 14 to 22 million people to experience extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the nearly 300 million migrant workers from rural China have been stranded at home in rural areas or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus transmission could eliminate 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32<0x25>, according to an estimate by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Emergency in India has caused tens of millions of foreign workers in India (paid through daily wages) to be out of work. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute of Emergency in March 2020 found that 44<0x25> of Canadian households suffered some kind of unemployment.
By mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their employees to a short-term government-subsidized employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
A short-term job compensation scheme was implemented by France and Britain.
The art and cultural heritage presentation sector has been deeply impacted by the pandemic, affecting the operation of organizations as well as individuals working on salaries and freelance work around the world.
Organizations of the arts and culture sector strive to enhance their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their workers and communities, and support artists whenever possible.
As of March 202, around the world and at varying levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, event and performances are cancelled and postponed to an uncertain time.
In feedback, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platefom. Another recent and increasingly plunging fallout as a result of the outbreak is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, tech seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent's Christian repentance season, had been cancelled.
Many bishops have suggested that older Christians sit at home instead of attending the Church Ceremony on Sundays; some churches have held church services via radio, live streams online or on television while others offer guidance worship in the past.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop closing the church and the small church as well as the square of St. Peter vacated from the Christian congregation, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gudwaras.
Iran's health minister announced Friday's cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and tombs were later closed, while Saudi Arabia blocked the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the shrines in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to sports calendars around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or suspended, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak affected plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "re-scheduled to date after 2020 but not exceeding the summer of 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have been closed as well as live poker matches have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gambling legs to turn online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rate. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling tour concerts.
Many great theatres such as theatres on Broadway also hang all the performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to jokes and entertainment behind uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and roughness have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments depicted in various groups around the world saying Chinese people deserved the virus or received what was claimed to be a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most of the residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their home territory.
There is support for China, both on and offline, as well as against those in areas badly hit by the virus.
Following the development of the pandemic to new hot areas, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, can also be victims of suspicion and xenophobia. People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a lobbying petition to ban Chinese citizens from entering the country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan fence mark went viral on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported levels of racist disorder, as well as escalating attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "China virus", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-China.
Dissidents in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, who share the border with China, and study in the main Indian city have reported experiencing disorders related to the coronavirus outbreak.
President of the Bharatiya Janata State Party unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese people had destroyed the environment and "that's why God rewarded them for their actions."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens have been aggravated by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposure".
Many newspapers with paid ads have issued them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to outbreaks available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results immediately on preprinted servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus as well as methods to detect the antibodies produced in response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA coronavirus.
The test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and supervision.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
The exact rate of death from disease and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
As a result of limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has expected data on the virus prevalence in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of their population, and there is a huge diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect the reported death rate of cases, which may be overestimated significantly in some countries.
Using reverse transcription of polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR) real-time tests can be done on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat swabs can only be trusted in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to double in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second mingu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airway in the use of an inhaling catheter or the material causing a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time polyemerase reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) response, and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed tests by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tracking kid, calinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for "E" genes shared by all beta coronaviruses, and RdRp genes specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for the Healthcare Detection Kits of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus-based PCR. In the United States, the Center for Control and Prevention of Dise disease (CD).
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results as a result of the damaged reagent, and bottle neck testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this affects an average of fewer than 100 samples a day of this successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two components are uncertainly reliable until February 28, 2020, and before that state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also makes COVID-19 tests available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests have been developed and produced by the VECTOR National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be done within 3.5 hours in high numbers, while allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 hours in the test time.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use (EUA) permission to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar permissions to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid enlargement technology instead of PCR.
Given that this test does not require a series of variable temperature cycles this method can give positive results in as soon as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to accelerate production to send 50,000 tests a day. Tests that use monoclone antibodies that specifically bind to novel coronavirus proteons (N proteins) are being developed in Taiwan, in hopes that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes just like rapid influenza tests.
In March 2020, a written review concluded that "the chest radiograph had a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the discovery of CT [computerizedtomography] may have been present even before symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include multilobar ductile soil glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions.
Subpleura dominance, insane opening and fusion are formed as diseases evolve.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the current pandemic's origin point has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging features acting with pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals starting 7 days or so after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance. Assessment can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a point-of-care test (PoCT).
A high-speed automatic system in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this assessment but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT single specimens peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of extraction measures are not required before assessment. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provide notification to agencies as required and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the permission of emergency use.II By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kit, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore is much faster for conventional PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection starts. In early April, the UK found no antibody testing kit purchased was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme that saw suspected patients stay at home, "an emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient", they spit into the tube, send it back and get a test result soon after. The British NHS has announced that it is taking a test case to test a suspected patient in the home, which removes the risk of infecting a patient in another patient if they go to the hospital.
The past driving center has helped South Korea perform among the fastest, most comprehensive tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Experts Statutory said on March 2 that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory atmosphere and 10,700 were tested in the previous week.
The expenses are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, driving tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey of the laboratory of the year revealed up to the calendar week 12/2020 of at least 483,295 samples were tested including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital and Rambam tested and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients.
With construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown cases in Hubei will be 47<0x25> higher and the corresponding cost of handling quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan laboratories have been immediately followed by Hou Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily amount is 50,000 tests a day. Open source, multiplex design released by Origami Assays has been released which can test as many as 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 ratings. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid operators.
As of March, inadequate shortages and amounts of reagents have made it crowded for mass tests in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for further tests.On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emergency is testing more of its people for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and is on the right path to scale the test levels to reach a majority of the population.
This is through the combination of past driving capabilities, and the purchase of large-scale population-processing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)
Built within 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world's first on this scale to be operated outside China.
Different test brothers targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German methods for the production of kits shipped to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until 28 January, slowing existing tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of its trigger, and this country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet demand and recommendations for tests by health experts.
On the other hand, experts tell South Korea's broad willingness to make tests helps reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called on to improve test programs as the best way to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests as a result of the widespread spread of the virus led to the abortion of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of sweeps and chemical regeneration became limited.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had a "weakness;" the government subsequently issued bureaucratic restrictions that had blocked private tests. The country of Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The firm explains that inaccurate results may be the result of failing to collect samples or using the kit correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would retract the kits that returned the wrong results, and would replace them with different test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test kits the Chech Republic bought from China gave the wrong results. The country of Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that this kit be discarded to the Danube.Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health told the test kit that Turkey bought from China had a "high fault rate" and did not "use it". The UK country bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced it could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantining those tested positive and tracking those in contact with positive individuals of SARS-CoV-2 in, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, Italy's first COVID-19 death site, conducted two rounds of tests on an entire population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day interval.
Nearly half of the people tested positive have no symptoms, and all cases have been quarantined.
With travel restrictions, this has completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact detection, entry restrictions, tests, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved more slowly than any other developing country, but without firm restrictions such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to sit at home on March 28, but the school will reopen in time after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled democracies by aggressively tracking contacts, entry travel restrictions, exams and quarantine, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with more tests, relative to the death toll, had low mortality rates, perhaps because these countries were able to detect those with only mild or indirect symptoms better.
WHO recommends that countries with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are found in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Positive as <0x25> of the test" is influenced by the state test policy.
Countries that only test individuals admitted to hospitals will get a higher positive rating as a <0x25> test compared to countries that test all people, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest is the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning a person's hands that is intended to remove soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, such as diarrhea and years, which are spread through the stool pathway to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day that watch handwashing with soap are important, including: before and after evaporating, after cleaning the child's back or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after the treatment of the sick.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the children who have used the toilet.
After brushing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before handling medications or medical care can prevent or minimize the transmission of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can result in harm or disease.
This is especially important to people who handle food or work in the field of medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronaviruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower the mortality rate of infants at home.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in the high growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the rate of mortality in childhood associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, for example washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from the disease to nearly 50<0x25>.
Interventions that organize hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in episodes of diarrhea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to avoid diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as an automatic behavior performed in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under the age of five, killing the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million children deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, inculcating the habit of washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or drug mix, reducing diarrhea deaths by nearly half and dying from acute respiratory infections by nearly one-quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene program (WASH).
Washing your hands can also protect against impetigo transferred through direct physical contact.
A disadvantageous effect when washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Washing your hands too often is also seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day where hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of stool outbreaks to the mouth: after using the toilet (feeding, stooling), after cleaning the child's back (swapping diaper), before feeding the child, before meals and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when properly washing hands should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease including before and after treating cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching the animal stools or handling the animal; and after holding the trash.
The rate of hand washing using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a handwashing study in 54 countries found that on average 38.7<0x25> of households had handshake practices with soap. In 2014, the study showed Saudi Arabia had a highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was nearly in the middle with 77 percent; and China was at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some of the country's behavioral change methodologies now exist to improve the practice of hand washing with soap at critical times.
The Important Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale measures to promote the health and education of children.
Washing your hands twice a year, plus washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with florida, is the core of this national program.
It has been implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be increased by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce barriers to the solution, and improve solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are insoluble in water.
However, the proper flow of water helps with cleaning.
Due to its reusable properties, soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on the removal of bacteria from contaminated turtle soap have found that transfers are unlikely to occur because bacteria are removed when washed with foam.
The CDC site still states "liquid soaps issued without using hands are better".
Antibacterial soaps have been highly promoted to people who are important to health.
So far there is no evidence that using antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to choose antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance to strains of organisms.
So, even though antibodies-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin conditioner (aloe vera, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts).

Water is not too hot to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, soapy warm water is more effective than soapy cold water to remove natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike what many people believe, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial content on the hands.
Hand cleaners or antiseptics are non-water-based cleaning agents.
In the late 1990s and the early part of the 21st century, non-water-based hand-cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based gossips, antiseptic hands, or hand-cleaners) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with thickening agents such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels, or humectant such as glycerin into liquids, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
By adding hydrogen peroxide diluted will increase antimicrobial activity. Hand cleaners containing a minimum of 60 to 95<0x25> alcohol are efficient germs.
Alcohol kills bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-containing 70<0x25> alcohol kills 99.97<0x25> (reduction of 3.5 logs, equal to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria in hands 1 minute after use. Hand cleaners are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand cleaners are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Adequate hand antiseptics or alcoholic beverages must be used to wet or protect both hands properly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Fingertips should also be properly washed, by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands against hand cleaners, especially when your hands appear dirty.
The increased use of this agent is due to its easy use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing except when there is no soap and water.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand cleaners can cause dry skin unless the skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effects of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand cleaners containing emollients caused a significant reduction in irritation and dryness of the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol resistance or additional substances in alcoholic hands are rare.
The tendency to reduce irritating contact dermatitis becomes more attractive than to use soap and water to wash your hands.
A non-water agent, although effective, does not clean hands from organic matter. It just disinfects.
This is why hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is high in its ingredients and formulations, and historically it is less successful than alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohols that have been shown to decrease their effectiveness after use many times, possibly due to inappropriate reactions on the skin progressively.
Most low-income people are unable to have soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Dust or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Anxiety occurs if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase from reducing the transmission of the disease.
Abu is also a soap-like disinfecting agent because it forms an alkaline solution if it has contact with water.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent the transmission of the disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the standing basin may be contaminated, at the same time the water temperature does not appear to have any effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than just with water.
Sental for at least 20 seconds.
Engrossing creates a shift, which helps remove germs from the skin, and thickens with longer disposing of more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Sweat in the back of the hand can be re-written.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet and moist hands are easier to get dirty again. The thumbs, wrists, parts between the fingers and under the fingernails are parts that are always missed.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and exfoliated nail polish.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
There are a variety of cheap options for easy hand washing if there is no pipe water and/or soap, e.g. pour water from hanging cans or pumpkins with suitable holes and/or use ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "tippi pipes" and other inexpensive options.
Tippi Pipe is a simple technology that uses a jag hung with a rope, and a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water over the hands and a taper of soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate over the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Towels Symposium, to compare hygiene levels when using paper towels, warm air dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying the hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips increased on average by 194<0x25> and at the palm of the hand by 254<0x25>.
Drying with a jet air dryer leads to an increase in the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips on average by 42<0x25> and at the palm of the hand by 15<0x25>.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the finished end is on average reduced by 76<0x25> and at the palm of the hand up to 77<0x25>. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether cross-pollution could potentially occur from other bathroom users and the bathroom environment of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air out of the unit at an alleged speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of exhaling microorganisms out of the hands and units and potentially polluting users of other bathrooms and bathroom environments by 2 meters.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing using hand cleaning wipes is an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand cleaners should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Washing hands for medicine had long been an obligation when the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that warn hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found that its use could lower the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to simmer and rub each part of your hand.
The hands need to be rubbed together with the fingers inserted in a nutshell.
If there is dirt under the nail, the wool brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and wipe them so that they are dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents your hands from becoming dirty again when touching the surface.
Hand washing in a healthcare environment is intended to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("weeds") and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient, thereby spreading microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing the standards of hand washing and rubbing in the healthcare sector.
A manual on hand hygiene by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
Relevant reviews have been conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene, if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before the aesthetic, and
after treating the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "treated" or "antimycrobial") gives the agent a killer action.
Such a killing act may be desirable before performing surgery or in a situation where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'wash' a person's hands for surgical surgery, there must be a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching by hand, some chlorhexidina or iodine wash, another sterile towel to dry the underarms after washing, and a sterile brush for rubbing.
All the jewellery needs to be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and lower arms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long brushing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinseing, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and surgical clothing.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after treating the sick.
To control stasilococal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit from hand washing comes from the first 20<0x25> washing, and very few added benefits are obtained when the frequency of hand washing increases by more than 35<0x25>.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food than washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing your hands with an alcoholic solution by washing your hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each showing that rubbing your hands with alcohol reduces bacterial pollution by 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handshakes to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Klostridium dificial spores than hands. Interventions to improve hygiene in a healthcare environment can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based handshakes, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities at home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing pipes close to each private and public toilet are extremely rare, although there are available cheap options to build a hand-washing station.
However, low hand washing rates can also be caused by habits embedded from lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy for hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raising awareness about the benefits of hand washing and leading to long-term changes in the behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and assessment must be done.
A systematic review of 70 studies found an effective community-based approach to improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of handwashing at school was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEP that prevented schools from taking easy and inexpensive steps to ensure students washed their hands with soap, among other hygiene conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to finally three stars.
Developing a hand-washing station can be part of a promotional campaign of hand-washing done to reduce illness and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries related to DALY.
But one survey showed that promoting hand washing with soap is far more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as mothers who have just given birth to children or soldiers who have been injured in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, a "modern nurse."
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more vigorously promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness about in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper hand washing techniques" were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing someone's hands from" means declaring a person's reluctance to take responsibility for the matter or sharing the involvement in it.
It comes from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespreare, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to wash the imagined stains, representing her feelings of guilt over the crime she has committed and that she has influenced for her husband to commit.
It has been found that people, after recalling or reflecting on unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to be involved in other payment "washing" actions, such as making voluntary work.
Religion sets the washing of hands for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Hand washing symbolically, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual of hand washing found in many religions including Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and yadayim netilate beliefs in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also sets out clean hand washing especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims are also obliged to wash their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control against COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for job health and safety methodologies for risk control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control at work depends on the work site and work tasks, based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors of each employee who may be susceptible to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal employment contact with civilians and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics, and maintain routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Work with moderate exposure risk includes jobs requiring frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in the ongoing community or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as in schools, high population density work environments, and some retail environments with high volumes.
Danger controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing controllers, and having self-protection equipment in case of collision with people infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues exposed to people known or suspected of having COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from people known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these employees include engineering controls such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and self-protecting equipment that fits the task.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a number of impacts in the workplace.
Employees may not be present to work due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Trading patterns may change, either in terms of the requested goods, and how to get these items (such as shopping outside peak time or through a delivery service or past drive).
Finally, delivery of goods from geographically affected areas directly by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparation and response plans of infectious diseases can be used as a guide to safeguarding measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with various work sites and job tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and risk factors of each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The preparedness and response plan of infectious diseases may be subject to the recommendations of national or subnational plans.
Objectives for response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community is where the business affects the response taken.
A hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the latter is self-protecting equipment.
Engineering control involves isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Self-protecting equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administration controls but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on hazards to employees, properly installed according to suitability (e.g. respirator), properly worn consistently, constantly inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contact with civilians and other co-workers.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include covering when coughing and sneezing, preparing tissues and trash containers, preparing for telework or turn of work if necessary, not encouraging workers to use other people's tools or equipment, and keeping routine cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing drugs or other symptom-changing drugs, and flexible pain leave policies, allowing employees to sit at home to take care of sick family members, and employees to know about this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk jobs include jobs requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission that is occurring around the business location, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with COVID-19 transmission.
This includes the workman's workplace and the work environment with high population density and some high volume retail environments. The control of the engineering for this group and the higher-risk groups of the ward includes the installation of air filters with higher efficiency, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as plastic sneezing protectors, and the installation of passive guide windows for customer service.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect other workers and passengers includes isolating the sick person from another person at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to care for the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to close the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick travelers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and perhaps additional self-protection equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biobahaya bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and dehydrated afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include delaying travel when sick, isolating and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up measures should be taken in the cabin of an isolated person. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if the infected person has been in the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is a minimum to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and coir classes or eating at the cafeteria, adding space between tables, arriving and returning stages, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with symptoms such as colds.
When there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school termination can be considered. The CDC considers the health risks for power amplifiers who perform routine activities low.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper self-protecting equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers need to clean and unload their belts and duty equipment before reusing with sprays or home cleaning wipers, and follow standard operating procedures for PPE containment and disposal used and for laying and washing clothes.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues to be in a high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratories and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It becomes a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or operate specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, multiple procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
Homework of high-exposure mortgages includes employees involved in preparing dead bodies of people known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol production procedures are performed.
Ventilation with specific negative stresses may be appropriate in some healthcare spots and morgues.
Specimens need to be controlled with Level 3 Biosecurity alertness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends patients who will enter isolated to different waiting places depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of a known, or suspected, patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform the procedure.
In the United States, the N95 or better-approved NIOSH face part respirator should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fitness tests, training and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and improve workers' comfort. WHO does not recommend cover clothes because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluid.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for entrance inspection personnel.
For those who collect breathing specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without an aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protectors, or facial protectors, protective clothing and gloves.
If an aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE via telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room of COVID-19 patients, using only the PPE is not necessary for specific tasks, continue the use of respirators equally without removing them while taking care of many patients with diagnosis.

SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Relieve the burden and prepare for the future
TAKE/JANUARY DAY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No rights reserved.
We are in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our interconnectedness in the world and the responsibility we have for each other.
We don't have challenges like this before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendships and concerns that we have seen among all our colleagues through email, phone and chat are exceptional confirmations for the extraordinary human being we are lucky enough to work together.
I am very grateful and proud to be your partner.
Last week, some of them shared their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how meaningful the world is now when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how powerful it is because this critical resource remains online and is available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you keep the website active or your paid co-workers or our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially nowadays.
This is a moment that not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Alignment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next day and month.
In the discussion, we assume what we think will be a response to what we are facing and the best way to ensure this organization can survive at this time.
Together, we want to relieve stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down a little, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy will be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week so that it will be notified later.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work at regular times, missions can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not going to record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we told him.
You don't need a sick day or a PTO - just tell your manager and help your team revise your calendars and schedules to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, notify Bryan in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure that your condition gets the appropriate attention from the management.)
Those paid by hour will be paid in full.
We have notified and affirmed our commitment to respect the commitment of our contractors and staff colleagues who are paid by hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be very satisfying to us, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can customize it accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are some things we need to keep going.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Security, and Fundraising (among them) are doing critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won’t be harmful later.
We don't plan to move "double to catch up with what's left" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work more time to meet a current unrealistic deadline.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What Happens to the App (Annual Plan)?
In order to adapt to the realities and expectations of our day-to-day working hours, we want to adjust the timeline of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan delivery.
Our desire to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for the budget to allow employees to give priority to critical work, self-care and care of their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced working periods for the next few weeks.
Extended timelines greatly reduce the workload and stress of current plans throughout the organization.
We will introduce our proposals to the Board next week and will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, disclosure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues might be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to infect all surfaces in San Francisco offices.
They use a hospital-grade antivirus solution to infect every surface as well as lobby and elevator systems that reach our level.
The building adopts its own self-care duty protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be well available when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office has shifted to remote preparations completely in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based colleagues know, we're also talking about the imposition of one location in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
We've known for a long time that it can be an adjustment and want to give you some advice:
Limit the meeting period for at least an extra hour or two.
If longer sessions are needed, consider ways to divide for a few days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the material in advance.
Create default videos, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Having a chairman to handle each meeting, someone to monitor the interview for questions and track the list of speakers, and someone to help to take notes (or do notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphone.
Use your well-being payments for snacks.
Join the channel <0x23>remoties in Slack to chat with your co-workers about the assigned tasks
The HR Operations Team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support improvements in tasks distributed across the Foundation.
Over the past few weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edits until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions can be impossible in the completion of their agreed grant activities and no action will be imposed due to delays or modifications of those goals.
In the coming week we will make a follow-up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but feels relieved at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Progressively, CRT seeks to develop a single page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor its impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the coming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We are here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will ensure that all of these pages are updated and all the information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a highly impressed country at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or any help you need, don't hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a link if needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email to Bryan Judan - Director of Global Operations International HR.
None of these changes should be seen as neglecting our work and responsibility.
However, all of this is a recognition at this time, our work and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that is unlike the past.
These are the steps we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movements with the support they need, and the world services they can expect.
Our job is to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks to arrive in the weeks and possibly the months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be ready at the best level when that need arrives.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that connects the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 confronts the activity of angiotensin-converter enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it an expected drug to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry center into cells for several coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 peptidase N-terminal domain and the C-terminal amino acid-transporting domain.
ACE2 is a single pathway type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of the ACE2 cell is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the result of the dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually decomposed into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 twins on the cell membrane of most type II alveolus cells of the lungs, small intestine entrocytes, arteries and venous endothelium cells and soft muscle cells of the arteries in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancer to ACE.
ACE binds the hormone I angiotensin into the narrowing of vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine to carboxile-terminal amino acids from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He).
ACE2 can also attach a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of membrane carrier neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry center into the cell for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a cause virus of SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a cause virus of COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the papacy S1 proteins for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the enzymatic domain on ACE2 over cell surfaces results in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosoms located between cells.
The admission process also requires the infusion of the S protein by the serin protese of the TMPRSS2 host, inhibitor under current studies as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to make the hypothesis that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infections.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "ACE inhibitory use was associated with a significant 34<0x25> reduction in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the rate of pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less stable than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The re-combination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome of an inflamed lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour action effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 can be an expected drug for those with intolerance to the classic renin angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in the disease surrounding angiotensin II enhanced.
The b'Covid-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("connections") who may be in contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of users' applications.
Less disruptive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity logs on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they have ever had contact with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure with potentially infected people and provide quick feedback to healthcare authorities.
Applications are developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking app is at an advanced development stage, and will be available to launch in a few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geolimited applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with applications-based systems, including positive errors and potential shortages of effectiveness if the implementation of applications is limited to only a small percentage of the population.
Addressing concerns about the transmission of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related apps to its Apps Store, limiting them to only "powerful" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed their concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly on whether surveillance infrastructure was created to address the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped as soon as the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement requesting to limit such surveillance.
The organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
shall be "legally legal, if necessary and proportionate";
Advanced monitoring and supervision shall have an embedded clause;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data security and confidentiality shall be protected and shown as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent further discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties shall be defined in law;
shall be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Meaningful engagement by all "relevant stakeholders" should be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
Google/Apple plans aim to address ongoing surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking versus apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have huge potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a centralized server need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems have already been created that use a centralized server only for mutual communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track relationships.
Compared to using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the merger of all of these generates notice via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information available to the public, something that was allowed due to major changes in information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany consider using a centralized system and privacy preservation.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been posted.
Tracking relationships with privacy preservation is a concept organized with important body study literature since 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) to log user proximity on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. The centralized protocol includes the Tracking of Decentralized Privacy Preservation Proximity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, Other Event Numbers of Contacts and Privacy Numbers)
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using locations or data intersections to track COVID-19 transmission.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The same effort was the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without affecting data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by a number of unified groups on equally important methods and large overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global operationality for tracking and alerting applications, an important aspect of achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had already made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for relationship tracking that they allegedly will preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy preservation cryptography.
They also published core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system aims to be launched in three levels:
The launch of tools to enable the government to create a privacy-preservation coronavirus tracking application
The integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android plans of Google and Apple to address ongoing implementation and surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning a drug (also known as changing the purpose of the drug, profile, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of different diseases or health conditions from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and recovery plasma transplants. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein and ribophosphatase ADP.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment is not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is allowed under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients admitted to hospital but cannot receive treatment in clinical studies.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said that they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large study is being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the use of hydroxychloroquine prevention.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim to show favipiravir is "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median for 4 days, while the period of illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.

A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, suggests that "no advantages can be observed".
The drug is designed to prevent HIV from mimicking by binding on proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to change the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial of Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against various fila-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
An issue with antivirus treatment is the indication of resistance through mutations that can lead to disease and worse transplantation.
Some pre-trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high-genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials being conducted including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illnesses and another for those with worse diseases.
There are three clinical trials currently underway for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and very ill with COVID-19, two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

Also experiments in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothesis vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccines have completed clinical trials, there have been many attempts to progress in developing the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the cause virus, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Worldwide major outbreak transmission in 2020, providing proportional investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI's initiative to accelerate vaccine development, manufacturing capacity, scaled implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms under research and development during early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform aims to advance into Phase I safety studies including:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials perform preliminary safety and immunogenization tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining effective doses more accurately.
Stage III trials usually involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (certified as of early April 2020), 74 are still not in human assessment) still in "practical" research.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits other than their prevented disease.
A randomised trial in Australia aims to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility of vaccines that are not safe or effective in development.
Early research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, showed the need for level 3 biosecurity restraint measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Moreover, there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are running, all of which are virus vectors, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media promote conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known and a vaccine is available.
Patents quoted by various social media broadcasts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The period from exposure to the onset of symptoms usually lasts for five days but may start between two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between humans during close contact, often through small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these drops are produced during breathing, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface rather than become infectious for long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the next stage of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is with a real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves of carrying the virus and their guardians.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the common public differ, with some authorities recommending not using them, some recommending their use and others obliging their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific viral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries across all six regions of the WHO.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing congestion.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty walking and face or bluish lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or throat pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only data congestion and palpitation.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in the transfer is still completely unknown; however, preliminary evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of those infected did not show any unknown symptoms at the moment and are being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic while staying in their hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1, of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78<0x25>) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Caucasian and saliva can carry a lot of the virus.
Talking out loud releases more drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing doesn't close the mouth can cause drips to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that possible bioaerosol transfers and air collectors at positions in the hallway outside the public room show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion to become an aerosol and subsequently lead to congenital spread.
Although there are concerns it spreads through the stools, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when the person is asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of the symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although the whole is unclear about how easily the disease spreads, a person infects two to three people in general. The virus lasts for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus is found as detectable for a day on carton, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products weaken the layer of virus fat protection, deactivate it and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidina gluconate (surgical infection) are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for medians for two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses naturally.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin enzyme-converting enzyme (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface of glycoproteins called "pepaku" (peplomer) to connect on ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardium injuries are found in 12<0x25> of infected people who are hospitalized in Wuhan, China and are more frequent in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms, due to systemic inflammatory reactions and diseases of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very numerous in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) are found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with weak prognosis. Those autopsies who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocyte intrusion contains inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2 expression epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells are shown to correlate with inflammatory intake of monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic aggression was also reported during autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for disease.
The standard method of testing is the reverse-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
The tests are usually done on respiratory samples obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nose swabs or frog samples may also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks away and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect infections by viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possibly detecting an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) are in development but are not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first initial test of care on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The opacity of the glass shattered bilateral multilobar with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions is common during early infections.
Subpleura domains, many pavements (the thickening of the bellowed septum with the filling of multiple alveolus) and the unification may appear as the disease progresses.
Some data can be found about the monoscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, unification of lungs and pulmonary edema
Four types of seriousness for viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-intermediate inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinucleic giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: damage of diffuse alveolus (DAD) with diffuse alveolus exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovery of pneumonia: the preparation of exudates in alveolus cavity and pulmonary space fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leucoeritroblastic
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, regularly washing hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the shoulder if there is no tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after any coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit transfers by asymptomatic individuals. The social distancing strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups through the closure of schools and workplaces, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings.
The deprivation guideline also includes for the public to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from among them.
No drugs have been identified as effective in preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until at least in 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, known as "reducing curves".
The CDC also recommends that individuals regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
Again it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitation with at least 60<0x25> alcohol but only when soap and water are not provided. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitation, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with support care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other important organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves of carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but the advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical caregivers and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment recommendations from various agencies into free resources, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) versus ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care settings when implementing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals taking care of those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Infectious Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and congenital precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: PPE dress, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (as opposed to face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respirator is approved by industry settings but the FDA already allows masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect against congenital particles such as dust but is effective against specific biological agents not guaranteed for outside use of the label.
When a mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of a face protector or as a final option, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flown nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefit to critically ill people is unknown.
Some doctors choose to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles as opposed to high flow cannula. Severe cases are common in older adults (those over 60 and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of cases of severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> were admitted to neat care units, 2.3<0x25> needed ventilator mechanical support and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, at least 30<0x25> of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators are able to control pressure and high PEEP is needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injuries related to ventilators and pneumothoraxes.
High PEEP may not be available in longer ventilators.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears as the most anticipated.
While new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, some drugs are already being tested for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral medications may be tested in people with severe diseases.
WHO recommends volunteers participate in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA provides temporary permission for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases for their serious or easily threatened lives.
It has not yet gone through the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with disease outbreaks.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app can detect "close familiarity" using surveillance data and thereby potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. Large data analysis on cellular phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and people they are connected to in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data of their mobile phones facing the coronavirus.
Steps are taken to enforce quarantine and protect those related to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to track quarantine offenders.
Italian provincial health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40<0x25> of people continue to move everywhere".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called on the global for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying. "The increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are the perfect thousand that harm people's mental health and well-being."
Disease will cause mild effects with few or no symptoms, resembling normal upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of getting a severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly become acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal freezing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal freezing, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, has been evident in as many as 6<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is observed in 4<0x25> of this group.
At least 20-30<0x25> of people infected with COVID-19 show increased liver enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent for hospital admission.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median period of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In early case studies, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25> while women with a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
A histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolus damage with exudated cellular fibromisoids in both lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
Pictures of the lungs show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with increased levels of troponin or cardium stalled.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with existing health conditions, the availability of regional medical and socioeconomic resources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from conditions vary due to their territorial differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lower counts of mild cases can lead to over estimates for mortality rates.
However, the fact that death is caused by infection cases in the past can mean that the death rate is over-approximate.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term follow-up of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20<0x25> decrease in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to syndrome after careful care follows recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviors, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by positive tests for the coronavirus at a reported date.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with a prolonged infection than with a re-infection.
Viruses are considered natural and originate from animals, through overflow infections.
The exact origin is unknown, but until December 2019 the overall transmission of the infection was almost all driven by transplantation from human to human.
A study for the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reveals the earliest date of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest start of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
Some steps are usually used to measure mortality rates.
These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, periods since early transmission and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO prescribed emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for death from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for death from SARS-CoV-2 infection without clinically-diagnosed or epidemiologically diagnosed laboratory verification. The death rate compared to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Totals vary by region. Other measures include the death rate of cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and follow certain populations from infection to case settlement.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of infected people.
At the epidemic center in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7<0x25>) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing lower mortality rates in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is still not overwhelming.
In the Netherlands, at least 3<0x25> may have antibodies as rated by blood donors.
69 (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for both men and women.
The death rate for men in the study was higher in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is that they are in their 50s, with the gap between men and women reaching only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8<0x25> for men and 1.7<0x25> for women.
The real reasons for these sex differences are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Sex-based immunological differences, lack of prevalence of smoking in women and men form joint morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected individuals are men and 72<0x25> of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the disease's official name is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for epidemic times was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references at specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the "Covid-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During early transmission in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guide to location use for disease and virus name.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture healthcare materials such as nose swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs an immediate ventilator valve, and the supplier can't send it on the required time scale, a engineering beginner turns locally and produces 100 required valves overnight.
After the initial transmission of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged related to origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of imitation of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being undertaken by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of the treatment of the current four antiviral compounds with the most expected effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a virus vaccine as a whole.
The use of the virus is either inactive or dead, aimed at acquiring immediate immune response in the human body to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system in some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on the S-population protein that helps the virus invade the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies need to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased antibody dependence is proposed as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a controversy.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were already approved as treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-changed antiviral medication covers most of China's research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for several countries to be reported by the end of April.
A clinical development dynamic review for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being assessed for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir join beta interferon.
There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with the loving use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, gave early results.
However, there is a call for a review of the research equivalent.
Korean and Chinese authorities recommend using chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published emergency use permission for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical experts treating those infected with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing a low concentration inhibition on SARS-CoV-2. Studies show that early increased protein injection by transmembrane 2 series protease (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the next stage for severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anticytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing non-racial phase 2 tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this intends to counteract such developments, which are considered the cause of death for some infected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-influenced cytokine refractory syndrome for different reasons, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring the infected and concentrated antibodies produced by their immune system recovering from COVID-19 to people in need of it is being investigated as a non-vaccination method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tried on SARS with no conclusive results.
Neutralization of viruses is a mechanism of action expected that passive antibody therapy can be an intermediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cellular sanitation reliance on antibodies and/or phagocytosis are likely.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced are in development.
Recovery serum production, consisting of a part of the blood fluid from patients recovering and containing specific antibodies on the virus, can be increased for faster execution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the transmission of the virus.
