Welsh Assembly (AM) members are worried if they ‘look like muppets'.
There are concerns among some AM against a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Members of Welsh Parliament).
This was due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM worker party said that his group was concerned, "The designation is similar to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" towards the name change, but judged that this was a misunderstanding of the MWP's abbreviation into Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AM is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The decision of the Government of Wales in 2017 authorized the Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to get broad support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of designation of AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultations.
The AM seems to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could upset the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill within weeks.
These reform laws will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AM and the drafting of the committee system.
The AM will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the EU and NATO membership offer.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opposition to the vote for a name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price that had to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells don't tickle when the Churches in Harlem are in trouble
“Historically, the old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adam said.
“Today, there is none.”
He said the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways” right now, he said.
"Bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was concerned that money from the sale of assets would not last as long as leaders expected, “and sooner or later they would come back again from scratch.”
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the sacred places left in the vicinity.
“The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the day when these churches are closed simultaneously because it is unlikely that those who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
Black churches that have been worshipping in the surrounding area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail traders on the 125th street, the main street to shop in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built the tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Reverend Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin proudly called the tower's bell the "Bell of the Poor"
An expert who sounded the tower's bell in July gave him another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world’s first tower bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who turned to ring the larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months is an elaborate architectural and contractor story, some carried by lay church leaders, and others carried by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the diocese's governing body, formed from lay leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "would seek to charge" the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Sharks injuring 13-year-old teenager in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he divested to catch a lobster in California in the opening ceremony of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy calling for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "realized" that the boy was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire collarbone was torn," Hammel said that he realized it when he had reached the boy.
“I screamed to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the top of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the sake of investigation and security.
Giles is aware that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with shop-style beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves to be successful.
Investing in beauty has become a hunting ground for supermarkets to utilize shelves that were used as displaying TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup suite so most of its products will be friendly to vegans – something that young shoppers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first to open in Croydon. London south last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and changing the purchase of food needs in small quantities at local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, has said that the stalls will increasingly look like Malls as the supermarket chains try to counter pressurers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he said had supported daily groceries sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket efforts to renovate beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested joint ventures with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from chemical stores in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of luxurious skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the look and feel of beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed so that it fits all needs, an enticing environment and a comfortable location signify that at this time we are an enticing goal that challenges the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘geram' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Den's Dragons star Peter Jones leaves ‘embroken' after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million lifestyle business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby did not have time to manage the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple’s business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The host of This Morning, aged 37, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made a Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones is angry by pulling away at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was so "wrong" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business kingdom headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, Really.
Their business has been equated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truely, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly is by far Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would make him last for decades to come.
His decision to retreat left everyone involved utterly astonished.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars because of its massive investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothes and home supplies, as well as the potential for further delays in launching.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truely along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple were on vacation together and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV host called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Talking seriously ‘and then we fall in love’
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some consider to be "non-presidential" and have been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mockery of his "news readers".
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korea’s denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no “appropriate response” from the United States to the initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
“If we are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought a positive result – stopping rocket experiments, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And she defended her unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastate an island, killing hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is homeless, there are no national disaster statements, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Mrs. Sumpong said.
While Save The Children is forming a team to depart to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute.
Given the constant tremors of the earth experienced by Indonesia, the country is still very unprepared for natural anger.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although danger warnings have been reported, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
In the best of times, travel between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been stationed in Lombok to care for victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railroads.
But a lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko’s government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions that are still ongoing in Indonesia, where majority Muslims have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as mobs of Muslims and Christians fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League with one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri about 30 yards away from Chelsea when his side were 1-0 behind.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking him towards a distant pole.
The ball soars high above the goal when the ball soars to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past the Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and taking one chance and not thinking too much about it, and just doing a kick.
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the first half after Belgium's flagship Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue striker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near midfield and running quickly into central Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave a bait and ran in the midfield.
He then did a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kick the ball into the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, said Sutopo Purwo, an agency spokesman at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, is filled with wreckage of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murders has been carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55am with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on alleged murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I asked everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of telling the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he knew what was going on.
Citizens are currently being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas were now being enacted as the scene of the incident.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He always said ‘this is terrible’.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is required to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by quoting the 247 log on September 30.
The Cromwell Parliament statue becomes the last memorial affected by ‘historical rewriting’
His eviction would be a poetic justice over the Taliban's ala-devastation of many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that the figure Oliver Cromwell outside the palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the British civil war was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestral Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century proof of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, it is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that difference.
His success as a Protector is also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Persecutes Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a disconnected artery, covered in blood near a pig cage in the market area of Liupanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in <0x58>ining province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the nearby pork cage door had been opened.
He said that in a pig's cage there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound-pound male pig has persecuted the rancher to death, according to reports.
“My cousin’s bulls were bleeding and shattered,” the cousin, known by the clan “Wu”, was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities were reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts resulting in the man being seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a 650-pound-pound pig clamped a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife scared him and expelled the beast.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive but that the smell of blood could act as "a trigger".
"They're just joking.
They're bitches, very curious...they're not going out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rains extending to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
After all, Rosa will cause flooding throughout northern and southwestern Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane starting at 5 a.m. East Region time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely moving northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Trench began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the U.S..
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are likely to occur with conditions that are deteriorating rapidly due to the nature of the scattered tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the ravine to become a ferocious river and storms will bring local strong winds and dusty.
Nearby troughs will cause local heavy rainfall to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There are precise examples of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. region on Sunday.
There are temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will form and re-spread.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm beginning in October with speeds spreading by 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show high odds for temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. through mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an appealing statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and women who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to report unexpected events at the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was groping her body drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it wasn't the case.
There are more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, who have watched it.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people watching it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is an almost the same number of viewers as football playoff games or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh’s appointment, excelled at all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was taunted, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, “You have power when there are many helpless women.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in a committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, over her plans to exit the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured him on the newspaper's front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about the UK and the EU that should collect tariffs on each other was "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, CBS's WAFB affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he claimed to have committed a fatal shooting at Wayde.
His contract has been set for <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reported.
The Baton Rouge East Parish Coronary Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding residents in aiding the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked territorial law enforcement for his “stretchedness and quest for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
At 6.6 feet tall lived in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcanoes spewing ash in Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and listed 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the thunder and vibration.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ashes attached to the windshield of a car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude quake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the celebration of independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of pro-independence demonstrations clashed with riot police, and when thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police threw them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day with police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" facing union protesters shouting, "Life of Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independently oriented region, a year after an October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, despite a low voter turnout in the presence of those opposed to secession and largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at TPS across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Protests continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy of being able to choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a crucial victory despite slight regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, both in exile or in custody waiting for trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her phone to support police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned pre-trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the setbacks in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of club Ibrox, for his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement was equivalent to Hibernian second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts leader who is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt still lapsed in defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses a chance against a careless guest team
Holt’s team should have excelled long before they scored, with their accuracy giving Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt missed across the goal face, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's header from across the goal.
The hosts were satisfied to let the Rangers play superior at the beginning, knowing that they could make it difficult for the immigrant team to hit the ball dead.
And that’s the way to make a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston got the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the mastery but realized that the home defence was impenetrable and overall goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not interrupted,
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish rescues from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was battered by the foot of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow were knocked out as a result of another Livingston tactical game.
The attack continued to come on Livingston's goal and was continuously avoided, while two penalty claims – after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – were rejected.
‘Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and results are phenomenal for Livingston.
For a man, they were incredible, continuing to surpass expectations on this ever-increasing trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have barely changed since they returned to the top, but a huge credit must be given to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard during the game.
However, the Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good - only once they could break down the home side formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their existence in the middle of the pitch.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a stretch of blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They argued about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — also voiced, condemning both, Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
Protests of resistance portrayed opposition to the existence of a immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turkish residents and denounced as a dictator by others.
Collision on Deptford highway: Bicycle cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the trench of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a run-off crash on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the Saturday collision.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and informed his family.
The roads were closed and the bus route redirects had been imposed as well as motorists were urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos
Six men were injured in a riot in a man's jail with strict custody, the post office said.
Chaos arose at the Long Lartin HMP prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been deployed to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and occurring on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained labour officers have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind bars.”
Long Lartin HMP prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with the serious riots in which a firefighter was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Rainfall (Drought Area May Benefit)
Tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that’s likely to happen early next week because the remaining energy trail of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern deserts poses a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting on Monday night with rain.
The National weather service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there have been only "ten tropical cyclones capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status within 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center Display Tool is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert include the central Rockies and the Great Basin are most likely to be exposed 1 to 2 inches, with possible amounts of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in flood-free areas, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be profitable because the southwest region is currently being hit by drought.
According to U.S. drought observers, only about 40 percent of the Arizona region experiences at least extreme droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the passage through Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland across Baja California on the Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning with winds speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles northward from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered colder waters in the Pacific and that is why its strength was weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, pose a high risk of flooding
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is estimated to hit the Baja California region to the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and into southern Utah at midnight on Tuesday.
"The main risks that may be posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains are very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern region of the U.S. desert." the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to cause threats of flooding and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four suspects attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset regions, police said.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have a video of the incident on his phone to come to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘accepts hate and anger' from the Democratic Party
“One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and humiliating Democratic Party’s inquiry,” Trump said at a campaign in Wheeling, western Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "received hate and anger" from the Democratic Party during the nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, coerced and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to strengthen someone who has the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a track record of true public servants," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks before the election was one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
“That’s why I went there here, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "fight and block."
The first procedural vote at Senate level in Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be implemented by late Friday, a senior GOP leader aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with rising death toll
At least 384 people were killed, many drifting as giant waves hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration at the beach in Palu town on Friday when waves of six metres (18 feet) smashed the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying whatever it was going through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, wood, houses, hitting everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the high sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the BNPB show many buildings and shops destroyed, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
A successive aftershock shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times stronger than the explosive power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of the tsunami, it can be said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the wreckage of a destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed with the absence of information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading for the disaster-affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency received much criticism on Saturday for not informing that there was a tsunami hitting Palu, although authorities said the wave had already been hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building was heard shouting a warning in panic about the approaching tsunami, towards people on the streets below.
Within minutes the water rolls hit the beach, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of power outages that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened only to channel aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victims increased above 800.
That's terrible.
When World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they took refuge in a tarpaulin tent built in their office yards, on their way they had passed through the devastated areas, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's horrible.
Even as aid groups began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of the groups complained of deterrents from foreign skilled volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and energy assistance from overseas can only begin to be channeled if the disaster-caused area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“At a time when the Government said, OKE, this is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will fix the grim storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was released from inside.
On Sunday, the rescuer pulled out a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with the body of the mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paralysis team, has been the coach for two missing paralysis athletes, who had the opportunity to participate in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Hotel Roa-Roa, with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my emotional burden personally," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how after news of the devastated Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who took part in the celebrations on the beach.
However, all of his messages, however, received only one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the message is not sent," he said.
The robber took <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging at Newport in Levee
The robber on Friday morning stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling the ATM storage box in Newport, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver has emptyed an ATM engine in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a report.
While he was at work, another man "runned from the back of Brink's workers" and stole one bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "The former was formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
“I believe ‘ye’ is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with broadcaster Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm you, my name is you.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means the only one, to be Ye - as the mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a liaison sign and large letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
The army launched fire on peaceful demonstrations on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the left-wing student movement implanted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double A.I. funding.
As China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds to be used for research in the field, said investor and practitioner A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who is already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Imagining AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to be far behind from the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
doubling the funds could double the odds so that the next major AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was already published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and afterwards he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Defence Research Project and asked when the next activity would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leadership; it's the company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have already hired figures from universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
“I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD holders in the field of AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just as the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations share money with U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic assignments is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the Selection Committee formation for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA (the cutting-edge Defense Research Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requesting the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no months of follow-up.
Macedonians vote in order to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide the country's name change to the "Republic of North Macedonia," an act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has denied its membership offer to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of its northern neighbor represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that changes would undermine the identity of most of the Macedonian Slavic ethnic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote at the general election and a boycott campaign has instilled doubts about whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed for the election to be declared legitimate.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a worthy price to pay for permission to enter into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born to the destruction of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the sake of the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs say they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires two-thirds of the votes in parliament.
The country’s electoral commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has prepared a small stage and drew seats in front of tents made by those who will boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join respectfully, not through the door of the servant," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe most of the population will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirming our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institutions on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote – less than the number needed.
Another poll, hosted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the first policy rejection of the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explored the entire Brighton defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence at Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the match.
He ran among the three defenders Brighton, before eager to get into the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four men in green shirts.
He twisted past one defender man before running ahead of a few opponents again at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick from the goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning away kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bit of the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
The Sky Blue front midfielder dribbled towards the goal just before the ball slid out of the border.

Scherzer to complain of spoiler versus rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no longer any reason to impose another match.
But the overcompetitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any playoff implications for the Rockies, who excel in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least gained a spot after winning a wild-card match against the Nationals by 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to win their first division title.
"Even if we play without a win, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams that will compete at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a match?"
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.
Washington's right-handed Pitcher was an 18-7 scorer with a run average (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation involving future Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of Republican votes in the middle of the election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for incredible candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a radical Democratic group that is so horrifying, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take power back in any way, you see their evil, their disgust.
They don’t care who they’re hurting, who they should be able to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and evil and vile and unbelievable.”
He referred to the Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Justice Committee by name, which was welcomed with loud scorn from his audience.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
He is now intolerant to anyone who puts his mind on it.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn myself, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the final order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our attendance was not expected – all of that because we were expressing opinions.
My parliamentary college student, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she defended antisemitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, an issue ironically the same as that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn with the previous leader.
The notice for the meeting of eastern Nottingham workers on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and appointments regarding politics that are "better, more friendly" instead of being long forgotten, if, indeed, it ever began.
The differences in opinions in the labor party are becoming increasingly intolerable and each opinion is judged by the authority of the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political outlook, starting to expect me to step back and accept a position that I would never have been willing to accept – both in national security and the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then after that there will be a mockery on social media asking for the cancellation of the appointment, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it's not just me who experienced it.
Sure, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today’s political era is how the level of abuse has been deemed natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party was supposed to help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in the wider church and with every motion of "unconfidence" or change the selection of party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that prompted me to keep my head down, not overly voiced my opinion, and then I would say "well."
But I didn’t jump into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as a local counselor and minister in government.
I have never concealed my political action, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would question my policy position and the things I do not agree with in the current leadership.
For those who advocate Friday's motion, all I can say is that as the country moves quickly towards a breakup of sovereignty, it will jeopardize our state business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy in the interest of loyalty to the leaders of the Labour party.
But really, one message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, as a member of the Labour party or not. I am proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of revocation or any political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr rises to top position
The last two attempts may have cheated a little bit of the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved to win Tennent's very entertaining Premiership match today.
Now they are in the top rankings, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to take the best chances, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The award for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's experiment in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given on that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot scrapped the unconverted experiment.
Climo loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he scored a goal then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try was changed by Baggot, reducing the odds by five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injuries, was outstretched, and since the game's relapse, Ayr drove faster beyond Stafford McDowall's attempts, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then exposed to a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unchanged Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The host had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for surfing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the forward wounded Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as it did again, almost since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked the goal and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth goalkeeper.
Star Still Game looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Kieran's Still Game star was seen ready to move into the service industry after it was previously known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the BBC popular show, which he directed and also starred alongside his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple had already announced that the upcoming ninth series was the final episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide live broadcasts after Craiglang.
According to the official recording list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to engage in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia is surrounded by land hoping that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol at the command-line headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Naval Base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
Resurrection is an obligation.”
Passing Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still clear – like the desire to once again sail through the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is likely to reach its peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decree from the court on October 1, following five-year negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly positive expectations about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ’s trial on screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s demands that – after decades of tense negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivian guarantees of sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia who faces a controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the Pacific Ocean's return," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia’s wishes – and that it will only change slightly if that is possible.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to hand over Chile, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ’s ruling comes just six months after the final argument has been heard, which indicates the case is “not complex,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international legal expert.
And it’s still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has already weakened the good faith of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain in negotiations, but it will be very difficult to remain in discussion after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government representative in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of Latin American presidents—using maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see if we need to resolve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States is implementing a deal made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen nearly starting a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a "simple dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of a declaration of settlement of the Korean War would make North Korea surrender.
Washington is on the watch to approve the declaration without the presence of Pyongyang that made the first effort to restrict the armed forces.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the country’s arsenal recognition as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of head coverings to the main road near you
If you want to multiply a collection of hats or really want to be protected from the sunlight don’t look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large-size head coverings for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hat has swept through Instagram this summer and these designers have shown stunning creations on the show stage.
What stands out from Valentino is a beige-colored hat on which is decorated with a broad rim of a feather tub covering the model’s head.
Large-sized accessories include diamond-decorated watermelons, witch caps and even a pineapple, but are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird-and exact masks ahead of Halloween.
Many masks of color are already sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A scuba diving-like creation is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you continue to browse through the collection of such acclaimed modes – then you’re lucky.
Fashion observers estimate that such a large collection of hats will be marketed to the main road near you.
The big-size hats became a very best-selling trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen to be worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of labels behind the very impractical hats of social media makes a huge creation on the beach catwalk-packs of straw that are about the same size as swimsuits - worn with slippery models.
The burnt orange rafia bag, sliced with rafia on the edge with a white handle rope, is a notable thing from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - because the designers are already making a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this was resumed in 2018 with outstanding test results, which are increasingly reinforced by each student and collective success in sports, art, music as well as hard work.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for advanced and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As the education sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern language continues to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, your speech will go into his head.
If you talk to him in his language, your words will come into his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that language is the top of the league table with the highest graduation scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who study a foreign language get an A Plus grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students earned an A Plus score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent learning Spanish also got an A grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an essential skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Today the languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that of some reasons why employers should keep struggling to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With the growing number of job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are important in the global world.
Regardless of a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingualist excel in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language well enough to have conversations and French is the only language spoken in two-digit percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important nowadays.
Having multilingual skills, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages in the UK for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in an independent school, with faculty experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teenagers.
It's good to be fair.

LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans are waiting to see LeBron James start his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"At the current stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season games to get ready," he said.
Trump General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a busy campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop at some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was postponed so that he could vote for a Supreme Court filly, Trump intends to build support for him for the upcoming half-time elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is made in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss a hearing this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is getting more tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and an estimated Senate vote will be postponed to a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main goal of this general meeting agenda is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of November general elections.
Accordingly, in President Trump’s campaign it was said that the next five meeting aims to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to the states as we face a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the meeting is expected to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an attempt to increase his earnings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. teams show courage to defend their hopes in face of Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursome session is what may be required in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum pendulum swing is a sporting concept that is the result of the findings fully trusted by the players, and nothing exceeds in a competition like this.
Where do they think the momentum is?
“Before, they were six points and now they are four, so I think we consider it a little bit of momentum,” said Jordan Spieth as the day passed.
Surely Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be passionate, no exception to Spieth’s formation and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally from the tee area to the green area and led by example.
The chorus of the festivities grew louder as the turn came, making an important putting blow to make the game a draw when he and Thomas lost two against two.
The punch putting from him that won them on the 15th was greeted with similar screams, a shout that told you that he believed America was not losing.
“You really have to work harder and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable tale of the Ryder Cup.
A unique but interesting pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The run was, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this turbulent crowd which assured them that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari would lock the potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
But it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shorten the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging a hole that the Spanish and Swedish golfers could never climb.
Even though, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to look at because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and led quite a long way towards the final day, but the fourth session also showed that the US team had the courage to compete despite doubts by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe top 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rising from fourball and foursome matches on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to score their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wants to keep a trophy that was not won at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong-targeted American team in the morning fourball, making the draw 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single games to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to defeat the pumping Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by more decisively 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally appeared brilliant but he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on four-morning, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2<0x26>1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it on its own despite a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2<0x26>1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then returned again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed serial points to maintain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday’s counterattack seemed like it would go beyond them.
North Korea says it’s ‘impossible’ to disarm unilaterally without any trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister delivered to the United Nations about sanctions that are constantly deepening their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country will unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures demonstrating goodwill” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons as well as nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is unlikely that we would disarm ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking gradual steps, a significant statement he made that they did not reject completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between US presidential officials and the new North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim promised to work on "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has wanted the end of the 1950-53 Korean War officially, but the United States says Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to loosen international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization in advance" and increases pressure by semi-sanctioning their goals forcibly, and even rejects "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is the illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that these persistent sanctions will deepen our disbelief.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by U.S. leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the problem with this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not come to such a dead end.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump threatened last year to “destroy” North Korea completely, extending praise to Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but the big work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue decisively and should not fail until we learn that full, final and verified denuclearization is complete."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in a matter of hours invaded that he made “an allegation like a gangster.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle missile locations as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim told him to take “appropriate action” to his will is the security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all the students of the S1 there sleep more, in an effort to counter the macho culture in developing learning through a caffeine-powered 'owl man'.
An academic found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know anything when discussing a very fundamental thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
‘Ultimately a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why am I only told now, in my final year?’
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, launched first this year, explains to students the essence of how well sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s healthcare services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were very sleep-deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was an overview of the dormitory room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lighting, as well as how athletic results were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep-time routines.
In other parts, participants got an explanation of how long sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change the student's behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health.”
The culture is proud of the ‘sleeping’ still exists, he said, plus that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students which means lack of sleep are a growing problem.
Ensuring you sleep enough, of good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says – even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, she hopes that all graduate students are instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students consider setting bedtime alarms, wake-up alarms, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its layout path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal down mental team Gerrard
Again, the Rangers feel the sadness of the day away as Dolly Menga's attack delivers a watery-spreaded Steven Gerrard team in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox’s team tried to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to be eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first half was finished and the Rangers players who were out of mind didn’t seem to compensate.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston climbed to third, just behind the goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers' stronghold after Calum Spence's line guard had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt left with the same Livi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costume that stunned their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have scored within two minutes only when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder drew that big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free-kick then met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stabbed wide in the back position.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have gotten a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the appeal.
Rangers only managed to make two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had almost never been in trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and the easy-to-tempered Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite to the game's run, no one can deny that they deserved it due to their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch almost made a direct impact when the winger put the ball on Morelos but the memorable Kelly quickly came out of the line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team were supposed to widen their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to repel the Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, claimed a penalty again as he disputed with the Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and ALWAYS WILL BE AGAIN...the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, Geiger has also been a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Detector, used to find locations of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
While wearing these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, it must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
It was the discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to ‘know’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'recognize' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘recognize’ proteins that are common in many cancers and then injected again.
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extraction of the patient's immune cells, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" a protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as the patient's immune cell intake and "taught" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Begins Diatribe Pro-Trump, Wearing MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
It's not going well
Kanye West was scorned in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance where she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would run in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town where she wore a Make America Great hat, she challenged the Democratic party and repeated her support for Trump.
“Often I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on claims of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West's scoring footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the stage because of the hat worn.
“They’re pushing me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They're damping me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a place to sink?" said that he would wear Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world to advance?
Try to love."
His comments resulted in mockery at least twice of the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused many people with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: Thank you for helping people."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being herself and it was really very good."
“But I chose not to reward a person (by buying his music or his shirt or supporting his “art”) who I believe adheres to and spews a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the late Prince music legend, changed his name to a symbol and later an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for swinging swords in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, denies the stereotypes of the macho hero, he says that such roles on screen make young men often feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of bad masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her playmate at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, said she felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now - where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?' he said.
‘What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?’
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of bad masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Where is the character from birth and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be boys?
I think that’s really one of the big questions in this time – how do we change it?
“There’s something wrong with the young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series would end next summer, saying he was “finished with battlefields and horses”.
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason for getting out of Game of Thrones.
‘I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life begins.’
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of the Leslie family's residence in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> surge in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> surge in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has diminished to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was called increasingly widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of his staff members had sent personal information to three United States Republican senators to MPs' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party insisted that the claim was mobilized by experts and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"The lies, the lies, and many more are vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of United States Senators. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual treatment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the shipment was connected to the Waters office and disclosed the information of one of the Waters staff members, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is absolutely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and safety are threatened by fraudulent and false allegations - are absolutely not responsible for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated charge is absolutely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This objection means anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't deviate.
You can't question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters at the half-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"That's right," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Water said his office had warned "proper authorities and law enforcement entities about these misconduct allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all of their destructive and harmful actions to one and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Review Again - Rowan Atkinson's poor spy parody
Currently looking for Brexit significance in every new film with a British biased view is already a tradition and it seems to apply to the reappearance of the Johnny English game-comedy parody franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm be insinuating as to how clearly we are a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s glamorous, rubber-faced, and incompetent has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time – his name hints more than anything else that he is a vast comic creation designed for a linguistic cinema region other than English.
He is certainly a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange allegations, has little Clouseau character, Mr. Bean's character secuil and a wanderer who contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In fact, he is indeed based on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving the chaos behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and a rotor propeller quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt less powered and too strange, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had confidence to include comedy as an ingredient.
His humor seemed to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the bizarre Johnny English misadventures weren’t as innovative and focused on the movies of Atkinson’s personality.
This warmer premise for years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identities of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent in charge – unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who had already completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson played an excellent role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but there was not much that could be processed from his script.
His intelligent advisor provides information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring a person out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as the principal in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to perform disguise operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency direction and reunites with long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, marrying a submarine commander, the awkward upper-class woman role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin who make mistakes with His Majesty's Secret Agent return to action, meet the mysterious beautiful Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister fearlessly falls under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventure: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they make a mess by smuggling themselves on a luxury vessel belonging to Volta; and English triggers anarchy as she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize herself with the interiors of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn for the final sequence, but with such hospitality and excitement, there are few children’s TV channels that contain about it all.
A pretty moderate thing.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Workers deny plans for British citizens to work four days a week but are paid five days a day.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week – but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wanted corporate owners to continue savings through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be ‘pas’ with the party’s economic agenda and plans to encourage the country to support workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior from the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: “A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that suits the party’s approach to rebalance the economy that supports workers and the overall strategy of the party’s industry.”
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four working days a week are not party policy and are not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to refine his vision for the socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to retake power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘cutters' at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor's plan also means, current shareholders in drinking water companies may not regain all of their shares because the government of the Labour party can commit 'reductions' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also confirmed his plan to put workers on the company's board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would pocket annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views.
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the findings of the bureau could influence Republican senators to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could make them change their mind.
It seems that Kennedy is more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the allegations appeared, and said, ‘You did it?’
He is a strong, determined, firm man."
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people he mentions his name cannot verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has This Event Done to Reduce Poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive array of stars, and a mission that is also memorable; ending the world’s poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or other means of helping raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goals for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to get people to do something, or is it just another case called “clicktivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had been channelled or fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their maximum potential,” promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, contributors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in General Questions and Answers on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: “It’s going to be a long and tough road – sometimes we’re going to fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars that appear at this year's show in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hamper Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could seek naval help to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia’s involvement in Syria — in particular, in its place operating at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext to explore the new energy market.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lines, and, if necessary, to carry out a blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself a "energy customer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"Economic options in Iran and Russia are more or less, utilizing and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in that field" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as Trump's government representatives are on a mission in order to increase their exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
For that, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil refinery pipeline project, which Trump said, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the capacity of the existing refinery pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington's harsh resistance to the project was solely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to put pressure on and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I will face major problems if the third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "observe the situation" as she runs for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senators say
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "observe the situation" while running for president after the half-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our corrupt government, including putting women at the top,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will look at the situation while running for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the city hall, saying that he was "bringing this region in the wrong direction."
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before making a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday, suggests that most of Warren's constituencies themselves do not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said senators should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going to experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are experiencing," he said in front of an audience in the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back slightly differently, they came back louder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and pilots and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and gun ownership in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his colleague "and his son, who is a ruthless gang member," had harassed him, but U.S. officials refused his asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutor in favour of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced large numbers of asylum applicants for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy goes against the 2014 Immigration Appeal Council’s decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such a ban violates the principle,” he said.
The prosecutor further gave a brief opinion that the policy that refused immigrant entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that it was likely they would become entrepreneurs and "supplie the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries due to persecution or fears caused by racial, religious, national, or membership in certain social groups, or political opinions," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in Palu as victims doubled while racing with time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her demanding baby boy at a refugee center in the devastated town of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance comes with the body.
Clean water is very rare.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking things underwater, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5-magnitude quake, was very chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from spinal fractures and shoulders, lay outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
His tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the quake shook his fifth floor hotel room where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save myself.
I think I’m stuck in the wreckage,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then I was silent.
I don’t know how it is and my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'acting intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after official Chinese newspapers loaded a four-page ad in a U.S. daily calling for reciprocal gains in U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an accusation China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the elections in the U.S., which marked what U.S. officials had told Reuters, were a new phase in the escalation of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently under increasing trade wars, leading them to raise tariff rates on each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa in favor of the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt workers, farmers, and business people in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion on Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling that intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the highly valued tradition of free speech and press freedom in America by containing paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the stalls of street newspaper vendors here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the actual reflection of the different opinions the Chinese might have on China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China refused an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans Leaving Female Voters Before Half-Time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
Due to the vast majority of Republicans standing up and defending Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counterattacks, especially from women, at the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions over the matter are very high, and most Republican members are recorded already showing that they want to advance on the vote.
That can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) push in the final minutes to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger on voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate hallway when Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to move forward in Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
“People say it’s high enough; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among female voters in suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony explaining in detail sexual harassment by the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts advised there would be a counterattack following if the Republican Party kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
“This is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about committee elections or final votes or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of USA Priorities, a group that helps to vote Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans are likely to be divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favourable choice to the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents really believe or may believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or actually lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
Following the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the drunken Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals when they attended a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventors Plan to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, launched a startup trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to start now,” he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
This storage can include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about this personal online data storage is that it really depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
In companies it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company delivers the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on projects, and a community of volunteer codemakers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
“We do not ask for their permission.”
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the neutrality of network debates.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next web era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church cleric in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attacks on Benllenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British military honors.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a stone "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievements won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "passing through a very thick mist under a string of firearms from field weapons and machinery."
Then he rushed forward to the combat line and with the "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field weapons alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I wouldn’t be able to live but it was a very humble act.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a bouquet after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be involved in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, but they even get Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you’ve been staying up all night to watch the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in England were stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up until the early morning special for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the turn to a children's cartoon movie as "an annoying joke."
"It is government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so it is replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Yes, the pig."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would improve their schedule by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
"I think if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," Coker said.
"But it's right now there at six a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of the turn, a lot of text goes back and forth and it's all not educating.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We’re going to cut up to five fights alone out of six fights – as we usually do – and we’re going to try to avoid excessive screening for fans, and we’re successful.
This is an unfavorable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low self' related to sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality problems — but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said, she was talking about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The host who used to host this long-running event, Kirsty Young, was taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the people who were knocked out of Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt “less compared to” everyone else who grew up with him because it was “not a socially acceptable thing to like men and women.”
He said, “To this day, that feeling is less than the others, and the feeling is different, has become real things that give me the power and the strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two Olympic bronze medal winners have been a renowned LGBT campaigner and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, and he said age gaps were not a problem.
"When you're having so many problems at a very young age" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you ask me last year, it’s all about ‘I have to win the gold medal’,” he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is of the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
“I held her hand as she stopped breathing and still didn’t really stop breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was unbeatable,” she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of people at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which had already merged with him in his preparation for the Olympics and still made him shiver.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson changed roles when he was backed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to set his 12th record, was backed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, the five-time major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and playing his game on that range, hoping to fix what has bothered him.
Never been the most straight golfer even while at the top of his career, the 48-year-old was unsuitable for taking a very rigorous course at Le Golf National, which routinely gave a long and rough penalty for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it was not scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, to face highly accurate England Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, started with a hot start, then the Mickelson game proved to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, patted his back and embraced me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is the Hall of Famer and he has given so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that’s the way they play and that’s the way we think we have to go through.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record for the most played Ryder Cup match, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career that would never equal his individual record height.
Mickelson pocketed 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He gave me a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led quite large towards his last single game at the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over America, but had just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we get a big edge at Valderrama; we get a big edge at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just recently,” Bjorn said, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
This isn’t over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve been saying for a long time that I’m focused on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players playing on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never progress on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players are going forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to all the players, taking the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would have asked his players to play better individually than they did as a yaparn, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the final day of the big game, having been part of a winning team at Brookline before ending up with a defeat as Europe performs "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we are trying to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the resistance against Rory McIlroy in the top matches, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, another European player in the top.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I think I can close all the way," Bjorn said of his single choice.
New German warship suspended
The latest German naval bodyguard should have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class bodyguard, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy had already ordered in 2007 would come in place of the old Bremen-class bodyguard ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar eraser, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include a longer period of care – it should be possible to use the latest bodyguard for two years away from its original port.
However, persistent delays meant this sophisticated warship – which was said to allow Germany to highlight its powers abroad – would be obsolete at the time of entering its duty period, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 bodybuilder was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after shipment.
Few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class warships.
It is also known that the ship’s weight is so overweight that it will reduce its performance and limit the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project – including crew training – was also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - up from initially <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem that clings to the latest bodyguards is becoming very important in light of the latest warnings due to a shrinkage in German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "out of the ship with the ability to spread."
The official said over time the issue grew, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class bodyguards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats in secret
New research was conducted on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands aimed at uncovering the way bats use landscapes in their food hunt.
The findings are expected to provide new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and soprano and long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts who analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of calls of bats and which species performs what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with a detailed landscape scale about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes these results will uncover which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits come from habitat management jobs such as grassland creation and the best way to nurture forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by development and development work that affects the nest and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung up to trap bats as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bat is not blind.
However, due to its habit of hunting at night, its ears are more useful than its eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects precisely and barriers in their flying pathways.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is deeply concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, hive checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only natural reserve in Scotland on Threave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Plantation manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so, the work we’re doing here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of a bat inspection before performing maintenance on the property, as there was unwittingly the possibility of the destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and kill, harass, or disrupt, or destroy their nests are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Conservation of the Bat Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don't know how their population is."
Ronaldo, who rejects rape claims, prepares lawyers to sue German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim "fake news," and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid it by giving <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in Instagram's live broadcast video to 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
All they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they refer to as “reporting suspicions in an unacceptable area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz’s lawyer said it would seek compensation as “a moral compensation in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him, according to a report filed in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the accused incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappoints only "one percent."
Documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had performed visas on his injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to resolve the matter outside the court because he felt "fears of retaliation" and feared "would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she was constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain ‘will regret forever’ for loss of automakers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, Britain has told the BBC that if Britain exits the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a border delay if there is no deal, would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which makes the Auris and Avensis production of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90<0x25> were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK exits the European Union at the end of March, we will see a cease production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concerns regarding the exit from the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close a mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers are saying is the supply chain risk if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run based on the “timely” production principle, with incoming parts every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the European Union to cars made on order.
If Britain exits the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, company representatives said, and thus production would be discontinued.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May’s plans for future relations with the European Union were “properly calibrated to avoid border checks.”
“We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but for us to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence is not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, that we really should be able to continue what is already a very good supply chain.”
Toyota can’t say how long its production will be stopped, but that’s clear in the long run, warning that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and will eventually be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union manager at the factory, said his members are already increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once this job is free, it will never come back again.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an appropriate and reasonable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed again a week later" as the fight for future court chief Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia, as well as the potential of obstructing justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and possibly ousting the president through a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with a Senate judicial committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, maybe this week, I can see that retreating it to another week is also good considering the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But let’s just look at it and I always want to convey the latest news to the press.”
Several journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rareness of the meeting was not due to a dislike to TV reporters "who are trying to draw attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president does more direct question-and-answer sessions than the previous president," he added without mentioning evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it more often and you’ve seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and that will replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly asked questions while leaving the White House or participating in an open session or press conference with visiting high officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show you why, doing a free and sometimes bizarre performance before the reporters come together.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on concerns over Brexit issue
The Health Secretary has written a letter to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express state gratitude and hope they will still work here after Brexit issues.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to fulfilling the fees of filing permanent status for EU citizens working in transferred public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on this withdrawal continue, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been ready for a possible scenario of no deal.
I know it must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why now I want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contributions of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christiee Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Comodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the end of the round.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
The coach and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting it on the stretcher and taking it for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/level of injury experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red t-shirt second grade student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before exiting the game, which made his total tackles during the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher sealing fee when purchasing property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher sealing fee when they buy property in the UK, along with additional money to help homeless people according to Tory’s new plan.
This move will hold back Corbyn's pace of success in attracting young voters
This increase in sealing fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher sealing duties as they buy property in the UK – along with extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to withstand the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high revenues.
The increase in sealing fees will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that drives the Government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
Additional fees – which are an additional fee on current sealing costs, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent – can reach three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this movement to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s newly built property was bought by non-British residents, which led to price hikes and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set his foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the rich areas of the country - usually in the capital - have become "a ghost town" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in sealing costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high property prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to repair "home shadows" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for attractive housing reforms, including lease oversight and ending the eviction of "no guilt".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies, to buy homes as easy as the UK residents who are already working hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to be Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, a three-point difference from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that drew me back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at a club of that size, having previously rejected an offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that are in this club, there is no doubt in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably only see myself as the one who made it here, if I can bring the club back there."
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as an assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and turned St Mirren from the relegation gap to the Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This is probably the crossroads I have to go through," he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m fine, make a living in a reasonable way, and enjoy some things that are reasonable.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I always wanted to lead something and now I’m doing it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The survey found that the best time to drink beer was at 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased UK pub revenues that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on restaurant networks.
The figures showed pub groups and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but revenues in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: “The sun is shining and England’s participation in the World Cup longer than expected means, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, except restaurants that were hit hard.
The decline in restaurant trade by 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
Sales of pubs and bars that sell drinks have so far appeared to be strongest compared to what happened to restaurants that went down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, although not as severe as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just come out for a drink.
Sales across managed pubs and bars that sell beverages rose 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst said: “This result continues the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and the impact of big social events or sports remain the biggest factor in the sale of the outdoor market.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children — some of them still 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals the development of the "Fake Insta" page
This news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have "primary" accounts to show parents
One in five children – some of whom are still 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep confidential of adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a “fake Insta” account – a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a “primary” account that had been cleared to show parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager asking someone else to "viole me."
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the Men's Principals' Conference" as well as Women's Principals" (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “This is annoying to so many teenage children who are trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers cannot find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of managers.
Doyle is the most honoured Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his various international experiences over the past decades.
“Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world’s athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre runs at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only time that could determine if I could recover and to what extent it was recovering.
It’s a very tiring job to recover completely, learn how to walk again, and today do dexterity exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have divided opinions in the online world
Breast pump companies have divided opinions in the online world with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of a product said to be the world’s first “silently wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom the new pump gave to express a mother.
Four mothers danced in a barn containing cow straw following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I blush myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this is not a ribbon, this is my breast."
It continued with the refrain: "Bomp out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I milk my lady."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying this creates a "horror" in the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within a few days of giving birth.

Another comment: "Trauma is understandable both for mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to take care of their baby?”
Another added: "An ad is missing meaning."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
The blackmail made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement was a little crazy but I accepted it as it was.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who are blackmailing (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like a "cow."
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with a hidden pump that was stuck in their bra.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insights of many breastfeeding women who say they feel kayak like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fits inside the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, carry their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie pumps are a pioneering product worth launching convincingly and provocatively.
By equating the picture between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump breast milk and all the obstacles to the challenge, and show it by means of entertaining and enjoyable with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pumps have made headlines.
At the London Fashion Week event, a mother with two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently to a Tent on Texas Border
The number of children detained migrants is growing even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to raise children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are documentless immigrants, and are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risks escalated in June, as the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to sponsor displaced minors.
The agency then ensured that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsorship associations are illegally in the country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That’s why we keep chasing those people,” Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which became the preceding standard, said shelter workers.
Most of them appear through video conferencing calls, rather than directly, to appeal their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those who are deemed unworthy of assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, said shelter workers and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concerns are rising in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are in a struggling child tend to be overlooked because of their size.
They say that moving children to a camping town without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that has been fought a lot.
Syria calls on "occupying forces" from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s war now entering its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syrian land illegally, on grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately."
“They must withdraw as soon as possible and without submitting any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem confirmed that the "war on terror is nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He insisted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" of the terror group and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and affecting Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem insisted that they should return soon, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading out great fears" that prompted the refugees to move further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicized what should be a humanitarian problem entirely."
The European Union and the United States warn that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition ends the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's large rebel stronghold has resulted in opportunities to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem insisted that the agreement had a “clear timing” and raised hopes that military action would target mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which “will be destroyed.”
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of governments and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that the panel's work should be limited "to review the latest articles of the Act," and warned against intervention.
Why Trump Won the Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of exhaustion for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s main clock rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked at cable TV ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headlines.
"It's a passion that attracts people because it's something that's not understood," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has other theories.
He recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump his right to vote.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Cause she made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in a mess.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the storyline emerging from Washington could determine Roe v. Wade’s future, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
Switching from it, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, instead of just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock you find yourself witnessing a panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward’s “background” source for his book “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket (“thirsty with pride,” The Washington Post) and the implications of the horrifying description of Stormy Daniels Anato.
This time, I will never see Super Mario again.
"Part of the policy he does makes it just like a reality show that entertains you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's performance scene and daily storyline player (choosing hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

A lot of money from outside floods the most stringent part-time election competition in the White House
Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the restructuring of congressional districts that proposed two incumbents in the same seat contest.
The recently redesigned district of Pittsburgh, filed for Conor Lamb of the Rep. Democrats - who won seats in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlaps with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition on the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in substantial campaign funding between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election that was overseen in general for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democratic party is a bit superior.
U.S. Pays El Salvador Punishment for Supporting China, Then Resigns
Diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until a partner expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to retract the head of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties are only considered against El Salvador, who had received around <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and economics.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and an increase in unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end the consideration of the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of government imports at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new rebuke or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about this vague situation.
Study Stories
Another shocking story is special adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible judiciary barrier, which currently contains very important evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
When Congress moves, Mr. Trump will be held accountable from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and may eventually become the jury of his partners.
So there is still much to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s administration is inevitable – or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West would fight against him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in evading the next years of massacre.
The beginning of history is centered along such a point of deviation, and the accelerated or delayed march of democracy is inevitable.
Americans now face some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the one overseeing the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and argued that he was unfit for president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account wasn't right.
“How do we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair – or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote in part-time for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feel optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a victory over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can take advantage of the result as a stepping stone towards a bigger assa.
"This is a very good point for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
“In this game we are sure we can get something and go by pocketing one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they may have performed better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
On Thursday, tonight will be another big day in Europe.
We hope to bag three points even though it will be a tough game because they have had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the supporters behind us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
"Last year we had a hard time, because of my injuries and changes at the club itself but right now there is a very good hope at this club.
The squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success.”

Although it turned out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only not many people discussed it with their family members.
Approximately half of the people in a Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of them said to discuss this with their children.
“They want family members to provide care, but there is no step to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it’s time to start.
Start talking with your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for care if you don’t tell your wishes first.
Discuss with your advisors and your family, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean is very important in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly provide you with his help in showing you how to pay those fees.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your valid document: Facing an obstruction of legal debate.
Demonstrate right away the power for your health care, which is someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power letter in terms of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of any financial decisions you have to choose, other than to ensure payment of your bills in case you are unable to afford them.
Always remember with every little detail: Just try to imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer any questions about allergies or medications?
Write down such details so you’re ready to answer.

A man shot by a wind rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit his chest, stomach and hands.
The shooting was described by officers as occurring around 2:30 BST, and is said to be "a random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries the victim suffered did not threaten his life and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
The devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
The disconnection of communications made it difficult for officers to get information from Donggala County, a region to the north of Palu city that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that struck with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city is celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic eye in South Sulawesi province is fishing and growing crops, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of nickel mining plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly centered in Morawali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in Donggala collapsed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years are as follows:
In 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a major quake, on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, to the point of eliminating 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of those killed were in Aceh.
2005: Late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and leaving nearly 700 people dead.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll amounted to more than 1,100 people.
2010: One of the islands in the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was also hit by a magnitude 7.5 quake, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that instantly smashed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also suffered a shallow quake and resulted in destruction, as well as panic from people remembered for the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, dubbed as a tourist island, also suffered a major quake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake struck thousands of buildings and temporarily engulfed thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of an attack.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and countering arrest efforts, as the Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she seized her phone.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pretrial Prisoners, with a <0x24>500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, as sure as possible" when asked about his defense.
Palin faces three Class A minor offences, which could put him under a one-year prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possession of firearms in a state of intoxication, which is also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of stabbed him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group for linking her son’s violence with PTSD as a result of his duties in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a severe earthquake that left at least 384 people dead.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale that could potentially trigger a tsunami has slid thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communication connections are cut off, and death rates are expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The quake then struck central Sulawesi, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how devastating the moment of the disaster was widely circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed — the sentences include rare and have not been carried out in federal-crime-related states since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed an attack by crashing a truck he rented from Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists on a bicycle track along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, based on a statement of will to impose the death penalty, filed to the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, the two charges were then allowed to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury detained Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the act of extortion, which federal prosecutors typically used in organized crime cases, as well as allegations of violence and attempts to destroy motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as a portrayal of Saipov's crimes committed with "cruel, cruel, and savage."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, harm, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
The five victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York handed down the death penalty for the last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant of the murder of two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty last time in a New York federal court in 1953, was put on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty of espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan’s origin, showed no remorse as the day and month went by after the attack.
When asked by the investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack was inspired by a video of ISIS watching from his phone, as per the charges.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of 22 charges brought against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" at the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute death rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without a guarantee of release would only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to put the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, Tory MP says
Nigel Farage called for 'moving folk troops' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - as one lawmaker, Theresa May, suggested to take part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporters, Peter Bone, told a street action in Birmingham that the UK “should be out” at the moment if Farage only served as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge faced by May in reconciling his divided position has been underlined by Remain Tories supporters who joined separate protests denounced Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggled to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union's attacks.
Allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a poor reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labor to decide between his proposed package and 'chaos'.
Bone told the Mass Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'remove Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint colleagues to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
“If the accountant stays with him, we’ll be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MPs hurled further: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He pointed out his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in a world war to be subject.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion could potentially lead to a change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people's thinking has changed and wants a fixed condition is completely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the masses, told reporters: “It’s simple, I want to say: ‘Prime Minister, listen to your people.
“Chequers are unpopular among the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are unpopular with our party and our activists who sincerely go down the street and make us elected in the first place.
Our request, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.”
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said politicians should be rallyed in order to "feel the heat" if they want to deny the 2016 referendum decision.
"The most valuable moment is the trust between us - the people - and our political groups," he said.
"They are trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not allow you to do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political group, which is preparing to reject Brexit, feel the heat, too.
“We are moving the troops of the people of this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the United Kingdom is self-governing, self-governing, and proud.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers masses moved through Birmingham before taking action in downtown for two hours.
The line of activists appeared to be waving the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking its line this weekend.
Labour's colleague Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues of their party's application when the conference opened.
“These people are the ones who told us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of the anti-threat border, in order to unlimited free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a funny show.
There is absolutely no good Brexit,’ he added.
Warren is planning a 'serious collision' in presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "shut up for the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future in a city hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's deputy campaign chairman in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which has been held in the city hall format since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if there were any plans to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to enter Washington's circle to restore our broken government, and that includes the time when women take the top."
He was arrested by the Sims, the LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced the arrest of a suspected gunman, leading to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man identified asked for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, the 20-year-old Sims was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde then wants to protect his friend and Simpson opens fire on him.
When interrogated, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and thrown into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, growing at Baton Rouge, that's the figure of the Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 prefixes last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team admits his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying event that would bring Mercedes' team orders to have a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and nearly left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and drew Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to advance into the pit and let Hamilton to move in in density at the end of the crowd, something that should be very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap afterwards and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to go after a few chase acts that showed Ferrari's reluctance to leave the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to stay in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in most races as he held a tire turn to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He eventually went into the pit on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me go.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through his insistence, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about allegations of sexual assault against future Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement presented by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead of commenting on what was going on in the senate showing people who were "bad and perverse and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and beautiful things are going on during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and perverted and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
What we leaked...No, we didn't leak it," he added, as an impression of the senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak did not come from his office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I don't leak the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he asked."
But his refusal appeared to be disapproved by the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'm going to tell you, it's a really bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the future Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment of three women, the president was impressed by the assumption that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see evil, immorality, they don’t care who they are hurting, they have to walk for power and surveillance,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants while facing Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday’s defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 home game on Saturday.
Giant got a two-goal lead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the hosts balanced before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season by Adam Keefe, who managed to catch up and eventually outperformed to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.
The opener from Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 of the pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In the dense opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became a feeder for Cownie's counterbalance at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead at the time of the first break when spearheading his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an edge for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he ensured victory with his team in the fifth half during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes on their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Died to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Flight Safe From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic driver was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major quake struck the islands of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post in a violent guide tower at Sis Al Jufri’s Pearl Airport in Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure Batik Air Flight number 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower was beginning to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are all saddened to hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency delivered access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The victims are believed to continue to grow as many bodies of the victims are still overlapping in ruins and many others are beyond reach," national disaster response agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
A wave of up to six meters has left the hammer shattered which led to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarkets are everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was also hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini delivers one missing man after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person had disappeared, after it was previously delivered to 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said at a release on Saturday afternoon, it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had been working with local authorities, hospitals and examiners to find the man.
The airline did not respond quickly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane was transcending the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to navigate the waist-high water through an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He conveyed the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired pier also helped rescues using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Flight Security Network indicated 111 people had died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts expose a woman's timeline of the night burned alive
The prosecution of the detention of the case occurred on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of a live burning of a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made outlines for the judges on how he used cell phone recordings to collect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, in contrast to the previous defendant's statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed the defendant’s cell phone was at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Mobile phone recordings indicated they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett noted that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deleted messages, calls and contacts of Chambers information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio wanted to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, which originated in Bristol, claims the hip hop movement is away from the origin of political messages and rampant social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent rise in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other blacks?!
NY babysitter sues couple for attacking after issuing a "racialist" message
A New York nurse sues a couple for being discriminated against after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and claiming she is "another black man."
The couple declined if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“Other Black People are NOT ALL BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
After all, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that they had expelled a nanny, a mixed African-American, for having done a bad job and she was more expecting Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and then returned to Uber.
Currently, Maurice demands the couple to compensate for the dismissal, and asks for a compensation of about <0x24>350 a day for a period of six months, in return for the caregiver’s work that he initially had to do, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims that they were racist, saying Maurice's fired worker was a reason to do, they were worried they couldn't believe it after offending him.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But can you let your children be cared for by someone you’ve been chasing, even if it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
As wrapped in "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just two months of giving birth to her baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“You’re going to chase someone who is in such a condition?
That’s not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While legal cases are still underway, public opinion courts have made quick criticism of the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington publisher fears readers will not be in touch with talking bears, new newspaper revealed
Her daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book had been accepted, was explained in the letter. "It was very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was going through, reading it first before it was published.
It’s funny to know as much as we know about Paddington’s great success.”
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a child book with a bear toy, who was extremely optimistic about his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was felt "sweetly sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though it’s not your whole effort.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and his imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her by phone.
At the time of landing, his daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
“Nad made a calm call to convey it was really bad that he was most likely not going to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given to keep her heart beating slowly gradually depleted and left her body system.
He had died a few moments during the process of handling and everything felt lethal.
I can just sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t groan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all.”
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - without realizing what she had been through.
“No one knows it,” he said.
“My head was let down and my tears continued to drip all the time.
It was hard to explain, but on that flight I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needed love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and contactable numbers for support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that her smile brightens the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if there will be a sustainable effect later."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don’t sit and stay – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts he didn’t look into their eyes or anything.”
He said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It made a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty when the FBI began his investigation
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for - an investigation that's time-limited, limited in coverage - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "destroyed" amidst a deadlock of the council's ruling.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to time.
Legislative elections remain five more weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will become very weak in their chances to make the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through which met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'climb' under Kim
The number of people who defected from North Korea to South Korea has dropped drastically since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's polling ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates raised by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most deserters from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return home.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to cooperate on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of development since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it is unlikely that we would drop our weapons unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical," saying she was not suitable for serving in the Supreme Court
Opposition Party Chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t avoid the thought that if a woman performs like that, they will say ‘hysterical',” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having trouble talking when discussing her family and her years during high school.
He also bluntly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were an "unreasonable and coordinated character murder" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats."
Pelosi expressed objection if he would try to prosecute if he was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential ruling on the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justiceist.
In an appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great?’”
And women need to handle it.
It was an ethical stigma, anger for months and years, and he couldn’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s weird, what do you think?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were removed as a way out of anger in part because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a male-dominated office, one day I cried with an unexpressed anger, was my neck gripped by an older woman – a cold manager I was always a little afraid of – who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they did."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder was very frustrated, understanding that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Somebody called it the "Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in the fundraising, and so he vowed he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a battle that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men gave him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he spoke announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotion – thanks to the people who supported him, frustrated with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger towards sexism – making it difficult to speak up.
"You might think I'm too nervous," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my grave?
"She's crying?"
How U.S.-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening fire of trade rivalry between the United States and China is so fierce, and as the fight is far from over, tensions between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing a tax of half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently enacting a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pleaded to equal the U.S. one by one, and the world's second largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Asking Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly succumbing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of U.S. trade competition can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that Washington or Beijing’s rapid political decisions can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers have known before,” said Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and offers aid to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate the destroyed areas of the terrorists to restore them as they had been.
All conditions are present because of the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and the thorough economic decisions that make their daily lives and their livelihoods a target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or conditional assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup beating the U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee blow into the water on the 16th par-3 hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shines along his round, becoming 1 in 4 players who have ever gotten 5-0-0 since the format in force in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-order player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olessen of Denmark.
World top-season player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 over England's Ian Poulter who might have played in his last Ryder Cup.
An eight Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with an overall win with 25.5 career points in this tournament.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gave his responsibilities to compatriot John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
“The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled throughout the weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was a time this morning when we made it difficult for Europe.
We're fighting.
Respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will rearrange, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be captain.
You have to pay tribute.
We have lost the upper hand."
