28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase at a local shopping mall this week.
The victim’s brother, however, says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affairs were finally going well.”
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-Spanish Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Coroner’s Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and she will be missed very much," he said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed at the hostels, but that recently “his business was finally going well.”
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has any information should call the San Francisco Police Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Practitioners on strike: Requirements for new labour market measures
Representatives of doctors’ trainees have asked their trade unions to approve new collective bargaining measures in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the entire Council to support new collective bargaining measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
In July, medical apprentices and medical students voted to reject the agreement with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
On Thursday evening, JDC president Ellen McCourt said in a letter to members on Twitter that the government had remained “obstinately silent” on the issues that, she said, led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorise a gradual and expanding collective bargaining programme starting in early September.
The dispute has resulted in doctor trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete stop to work in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of the BMA’s medical traineeship, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms of the contract negotiated by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 doctor trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: a consortium of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions to be over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that there was more to be done in Ankara for this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands at the event.
But Putin’s smile looked compelling, and he didn’t exude much warmth, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his “dear friend” Putin – five times, according to a report.
I lost my mind.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better levels.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild real trust.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, state-run media led an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has denied this emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of an armistice agreement for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after being nearly overthrown by the failed coup last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will surely be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the re-authorization of agricultural imports from Turkey.
"You went there, the tomatoes came back here," the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is seen as a weak response to an attempted coup.
Added to the long-standing resentment over the snail-speeded EU accession negotiations, Putin comes forward, who is eager to exploit coolness and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received loose spots from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the spectacular seaside resorts enabled the Russian-Turkish “coalition of outsiders,” as one analyst described to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, uniting their forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, the two have major differences.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It can be very eloquent that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin opted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a total disaster when a Russian fighter jet is shot down by a NATO member, it is certainly better for the two leaders to be back at least on the line.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank’s strategists have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland operates with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, except for headquarters and stock exchange listings, will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and employees because we are now becoming a much more branded bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move towards the brands bank, because basically (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win
Racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone on his second victory at home, competing on John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time master jockey Dettori, who previously won with Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened at Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads the Predilection out after victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in obstacle races - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
She's stylish and strong, but her tactical wit sets her apart in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would have ridden with 6,000 winners if she wasn’t just a weekend and big-game jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of his 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but besides that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a branded flyby landing from the saddle.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He won heaps of big race victories, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from racing for drugs.
Three years ago, he initially had a hard time returning after a six-month ban, but he showed remarkable character when challenging the doubters and returning in his best condition.
And he might go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Putin to fire Russian Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had “ordered Ivanov to withdraw from the position of head of the Russian presidential administration,” but no reason was given for this.
Ivanov’s deputy director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he led the president’s protocol and government staff, it is said on the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support you as Head of State when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be resigned and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confusing Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had withdrawn at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, only a few people here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy has been received with great scepticism.
In his comments quoted from the Kremlin’s website to Putin, Ivanov said: “It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me responsibility for this very complicated, if I may say laborious, task for four years.
Now I have been chief of staff for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second term, as Putin’s third term would have been unconstitutional.
This task, however, went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their resignation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner apologized on Thursday before he was fired.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the FBI agent team are expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything I could for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to stay with you until the end, but that’s not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish landed in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandwiches left behind by the waterstorm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published film material on the manifestation at Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossing and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four barriers between the "cover flanges" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 branch ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where the most precise dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge cover is now in place, and the concrete cover of the last part of the deck is being cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck had been installed and connected to the expanding north pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling a road bridge 700 millimeters south of the northern fairway.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at a slope angle of about 3%.
Demanding, because the tolerances by which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
The three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alarm at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the incident evolve at Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat proceeded on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," Moelfre's lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and the third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted, hanging from the buoy without life-jackets.
The men were taken on a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat’s engine had a dead-end rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in an action.
Display time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, more recently, to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity don’t exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they became a series of cartoons, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS and can then be “photographed” (by phone screenshot) or “trapped”.
The generation that played the game when younger has joined the fad and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the "average person"'s daily steps.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users followed by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
The calls for many public health campaigns to “find 30,” “get up from the couch,” and “be active every day” have yielded no result because most public health warnings are boring and cared about by people who seem unhappy.
The importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving spoilers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone could walk into the door.
What's the deal?
There's been a breakthrough.
While previously there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn’t give you a reason to move around in the same way as this game.
The attraction of novelty disappears and the use ceases in time.
However, due to Pokémon’s success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, fitter, and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on the permafrost.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver medallist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the multi-match championship in a row, and overall the fifth American champion, while consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same category as the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals, with programs that have combined ambition and precision so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final exam awaited in Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-expectations.
Returning to the family’s home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals, would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medals (in this order) in the women’s gymnastics multiplayer individual finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles achieved his first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the culmination of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi, at the starting party.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of the future as he traveled to the top of his long road, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program - which includes his trademark volts - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be well suited to the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and found by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman while she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force.
He hasn’t lost in a multiplayer game since the summer of 2013, and this line of victory is likely to continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanent, where Biles is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He climbed to the top with a boom point of 15.433 and crossed them with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the end points -- a mere formality -- and tears rose up in the eyes of Biles in glitter red, white, and blue, when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revenge from four years ago when he was in the third place, but lost to bronze Mustafina in the rematch.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "Grandmother," was clearly in the lead.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanence performance in an emotional rush of return, which at times seemed questionable.
As for the party, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police Say Three Victims Were Shot While Listening to Music in a Car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the deadliest attack on the first serial killer in the last decade of Phoenix were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The shooter, standing on the passenger’s side of the car, fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped by another vehicle.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not steal any handbags or <0x24>2,900 from another adult victim.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether it was related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in the last four months in two mostly Latin American neighborhoods.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of your home," Howard told KPHO earlier this month, a subsidiary of CBS.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and that they were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Maleah, Ellis' daughter, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also released a police bulletin about the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple killing, of an empty van, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet casings, bullets in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: “The situation is getting better”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not at all true – of course I did,” he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he should be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund's inventions signify "can you sing to me?"
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, such as Edmund, or prenatal viral infections, such as measles or the Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What will happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's getting better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Rainfall and floods trigger rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded across their banks and caused widespread flooding due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities, and that assistance is already on its way to those counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s security and emergency preparedness office, said they were receiving requests for tidal water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch will be in place until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that three to five centimetres more of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in place on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a record for flooding during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said there was a threat of flooding down the Ascension County, along the river, as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest level on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the rescued on Friday.
According to 62-year-old Hansford, the water in Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other boy, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It stretched all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had not seen the water so high in the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family were all injured and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where they stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods will "swiftly spread" as heavy rains continue, and authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding on the streets led to the rescue of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, authorities said.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the city council in Tangipahoa said 200 homes had been flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
County president Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets that had been surrounded by tides.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
Twenty streets in Hammond, Tangipahoa County, were closed because of tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued along the Gulf coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have flooded on Thursday, but so far no flooding has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still raining."
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, a second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child’s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several operations.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The assault rifle-type casings, which came from a variety of assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant struggle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were actively fighting," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
There have been no arrests and, according to the information received, the police are examining the tapes from the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a misplaced bullet on Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
So I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
The most successful female gymnast in the last four years has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected yet masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win an individual gold medal in a women’s multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got a silver medal.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the last five), because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the gymnastics team, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, practice in private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families), and the list goes on and on.
A large part of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnasts’ families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics coaching to the communities where the many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Latinos) and we have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical Trainees Arrange New Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to coerce the deal, saying the NHS was on "unfamiliar soil" and that even minor delays would harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to their nighttime and weekend work habits to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA’s Medical Interns Committee, said in a statement last night: “Physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the existing labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.”
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a reluctance by the government to participate and, at times, a deep silence.
This was despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors in training.
If he does not do so, the doctors trainees are ready to continue the collective action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike guards.
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 doctor trainees covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Working struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already demanding teams and services, and cause concern, anxiety, and disruption to patients, caregivers, and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional education for those returning from sabbaticals, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health have achieved respect for the agreements in November, February and May.
<0xC2><0xA3>2 a day medication can reduce risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given already for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the wall of the artery, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis breaks, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks off, it can travel with the blood and cut off the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Evaluation, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often disastrous.”
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add the available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from it.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding, over periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Allows Election Fraud to Bloom in Muslim Territories
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles blamed police, election guards and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to “racial and religious hypersensitivity.”
The former community secretary, now emperor of anti-corruption, said that the religious intimidation of voters is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guard chains outside the polling stations to protect scared voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, all the voters have to say is their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected," Sir Eric said.
He calls for greater access for the press to the documents and decisions of the Board of Governors made by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against election fraud, but it would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have “led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of the faithful Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the election fraud in the post-voting, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
“Evidence was provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that ... government institutions had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric tabled 50 proposals to clean up the system, including the prohibition of political activists being allowed to process ballot papers sent by post, in order to stop 'the collection of votes'.
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for stricter checks on registrations to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider alternatives to proving voters’ identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made voices and envelopes sent by post.
Let the police put guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that voters must go to the cabin alone.
Sir Eric is throwing down the Greater London police force, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The Election Court will be suspended as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without any doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised ineffective check-to-box checks by city councils’ voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the originator of parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by this worrying and secret proliferation of electoral fraud and the denial of facts by certain groups."
Crazy Kate's Cycling Double and other famous facial images at the Olympics in Rio
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger—at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be a star Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures of him appearing scaryly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the social media passion, the archer admitted that he had heard since childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much of a resemblance myself, except maybe with the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely come up again this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sportsman's" version of Inception
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more to do with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while the U.S. team Nathan Adrian resembles "the sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt," according to fans.
Tough Women: Soccer star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities as well
Theory Presentation: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the pair
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness that “others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and Dexter actress actually have incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautifully wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer is "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200 metre freestyle message on Wednesday raged the viewers of CBC’s live Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had “lost like a bad smell” and had “dead like a pig.”
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women’s 4x200 metres freestyle signal finale.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's commentary team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China blew it, baby.
Too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language and tone used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old swimmer in China 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on live."
China's Ai Yanhan was portrayed in the women's 4x200m relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not restrain themselves when they heard how negligent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We are sorry that the comment about the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that it happened.”
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Co-reporter Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The company quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and broadcast live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," she said in an Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn’t mean it as disrespectful, and I’m really sorry.”
A Primark customer is shocked by a woman who brazenly fits her lingerie in the middle of a store
Customers didn’t know where to look when she undressed in the middle of Primark’s shop to try on underwear.
What didn’t make things any better was that after assessing what he looked like in his pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to wander around and eventually matched four pairs of underwear in a store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where a woman fit her underpants and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman “redressed and walked away from the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underwear, took off her own pantyhose and underwear and put on fittings.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for atonement, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring while he took off his underpants and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the panties she was wearing."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident of the city of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I understood that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be awful to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has worn them and taken them off and hasn't washed them."
Primark’s spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestone Movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market."
How to Defend Yourself From Armed Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City to find out how to deal with gun-worming robbers at close range.
Whether you approached from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you must first turn around to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
You then grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the knee in the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to purpura, twist the gun from his hands, hit him in the face with the tail of the gun, and back off with the gun pointing at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal can’t shoot.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you’re not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks some of Europe’s dirtiest places for a travel guide
A British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk-born host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Trail of the Inner Force, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about reinforcing intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him with a bad taste.
Wright became known as a tester of bowel endurance when he traveled around the world and ate strange and miraculous things.
This task, ranging from public railings at railway stations to the flush button of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said, "Since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, starting with soil, worms, and dirty water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His specimen had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the reading of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveller’s film, On the trail of Inner Power, together with the Finnish dairy company Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting here.
On the trail of inner strength, they were produced together with a Finnish dairy company, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help enhance human gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea 'Let's call Ian'."
They argue that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can interestingly tell consumers more about it.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say it this way: If Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost all respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the things I was licking were easier for Ian, while others were quite awkward.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to stomach and gut well-being, and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
A family of <0xC3><0x96>ykkers destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before evictions
The family caused <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages to their house after being expelled for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints about them.
After they had been forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found that the property was in poor condition.
There were gaps in the walls, the floor boards had been torn, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is probably known through Cornwall’s less comfortable groups.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names are bad.”
The couple had three sons, who sometimes lived on the property, and according to police, the tyranny of the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarreling, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, was convicted of antisocial behavior.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat of demolition were found with old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs had previously been conveyed, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street and police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced the woman and her partner out of the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
The Cornwall Housing neighborhood executive director, Adam Fitzpatrick, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own behavior and that of his or her family, as eviction is always the last policy considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave members of the community who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Housing company employees now need to clean up the waste piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 grams of cannabis along with a scale, supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting to possession of a class B drug in order to distribute it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are now homeless in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who violate the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is unimpeded, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, and they will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun-worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane swept past a very low level.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, the terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows a military aircraft approaching sun worshipers in a sandy strip in northern Portugal’s Aveiro.
The holidaymakers stood up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not see at first what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic bypass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice at a really low level, and at one point it seemed like it was crashing into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and really felt like a plane was crashing on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, and four people have been killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that impaired visibility, smoke from fires and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Eksote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million in January-June than planned.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the waiting lists.
The exote covers a surplus of a previously incurred deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Sworn in Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took an oath on Friday.
The military ceremony of the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special border ice hockey course was held on the garrison sports field.
The oath was sworn by 70 soldiers.
Special Frontier Rangers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border ice hockey.
250 of them were invited to the exams.
Specialised border icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The meeting was attended by five wartime border veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the robber - Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had an RTA (Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In total, the unit consists of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
The Chief of Staff is Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costume.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working habits
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the way police work.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that police officers are less likely to go to the place of the swamps until they receive an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with three national units below it and a criminal intelligence unit for each police unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Criminal Police, manages the operations nationwide.
As its name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, an alert task database and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
You can also see your handprint at work, whether it’s honest or criminal.
Based on the method, the author creates a certain kind of image.
Serialisation can be done either by the method or by the person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA do not walk around the city with their collars upright, but their work is not fully public.
The methods used by criminals as well as their own are not reported, as this could lead professional criminals to develop their activities and thus try to prevent police attempts to prevent crime.
The police will publicly announce the methods if they predict that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which vacant dwellings were marked in the early summer.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin, or a piece of tape in the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually travelling.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis team has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
The smartest ones order a report from the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go with the thieves in gloves.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Police of Eastern Finland, Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
Against the backdrop of a decrease in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the own institution and the borders of Finland.
A schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, the country's base.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died while planning to escape from the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of this case is that it can serve as a gravestone and a will to others, that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it could discourage people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she had become a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a member to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted with “some degree of certainty” that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid’s spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “swing the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland’s nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s “hands-ons” and “opportunists.”
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is for "women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemeren to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models on their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, Treats chairman, told us earlier this year that his magazine with a wealth of nude photos is different from the old school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
“We need to start introducing the timeless and classical nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of naked female bodies,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can submit images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill in the comment section with irritable insults, written by the pseudonym NonAllIndividualMedium-agedMen, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much talked-about new arrival of records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but to the longing of middle-aged people.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely purchasers of records are those aged 18-24.
It’s not just about collecting people, it’s emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hold their emotions in (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I would be motioning lively before stopping, forming a cup of my hands and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it more closely."
Let’s look at this more closely.
While the charm and dirt of Soho is slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supplies stores now fill buildings that used to have independent stores - a handful of gorgeous specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment, as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to estimate their age and emotional temperament by observing.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in the twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and tours the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
“I guess I am,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These boards, which appear in the photo above (he sent a snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy," she says.
She agrees that album buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my vice.”
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she meets fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who need to buy their old records back.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have got rid of their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl arousers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly hurt by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be baffled by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar album covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage happiness days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said suddenly from a stack of records.
A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had purchased a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned while browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big deal, but it definitely does.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
Not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late teenagers, who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, which now has almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the stores mentioned above - the loudspeakers freshen Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove a nagging psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, watching the various records on sale.
He's buying windows, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn’t make a lot of money, so collecting records isn’t really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I’m trying to look like I’m studying denim shorts, I’m observing a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before father and daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with albums by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is purely "artistic vinyls".
But considering that even the slightest attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is not much to complain about here.
Not surprisingly, the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday mornings chewing around Berwick Street record stores, browsing through records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old artificial TV presenter looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the hopper has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says the record is set for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters tall.
French Court Rejects Request to Dismantle Deals in Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pennies), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Office of the Prefect of Calais argued that the seats should be dismantled because they represent a tax unpaid parallel economy and because they represent a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for evicting people from 72 temporary shops, but said the prefect of Calais' concern was "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a far greater role than merely feeding “people living in extreme insecurity.”
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the café would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — a peak — since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are falling significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is drastically cheaper to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while the average price in the EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen the second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels as in Finland.
Only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is available from Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen’s article, which was published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices tended to close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which the food became cheaper year after year.
Now the price is weighed down by the Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices in agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen substantially.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, which had a similar level of wages to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the control countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the same level as the old EU countries in terms of food prices, we must halve VAT to the average level in the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Mr Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
If you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
This is a rule that applies to all schools in Finland.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the learning of typography will be abandoned, and instead coding will be practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start already in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is a way to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found, ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It could live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is bypassed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, it is only about a centimeter per year, according to observations, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues investigated.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks out of 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the lens' radiocarbon timing.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and the 502-centimeter-long Amazon algae, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the females of the ice shark do not reach sexual maturity until they reach more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they will be about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - sales will not be reduced
Almost 300 employees will be laid off at Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of retailers in department stores will not be reduced in order not to damage customer service.
In addition, around 80 support workers will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann’s co-operative negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for redundancies was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The population reduction aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised during next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
The reason behind this is Stockmann’s difficulty in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store sale is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Chief Executive Officer of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s goals.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second-quarter performance improvement was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and profits.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will contract from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but there are swamps in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north we stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shaken by doping scandal – strange explanation for coach’s rap
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform for is 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi of Kenya's national team said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home for “committing crimes against the Kenyan national team.”
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee president Kip Keino told Reuters.
Athletics for the Olympics begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year and is a pre-winning favourite in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah walked through the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
the Rio Athletics Stadium
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
The fight for medals in athletics began in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top athletes were able to showcase their skills in a confusingly empty stadium.
Rio officials said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day of the morning race and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening race have been sold.
The second was in London four years ago, where the stadium was thrilled with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, the stand was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the audience of 12,000 people was only about 30 percent full.
At least the poor sales figures are explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a destination for European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not reach the full stadium.
Organisers spokesman Mario Andrada said on the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the cost of the tickets was almost half that of Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros for the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio in the morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation with new means.
Established last year, the Foundation acquires the ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem the land for ownership rights.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by those who wish to obtain the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will have a veto on the 187-square-metre parcel, which means that in practice not all holders will have to approve the land if the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for more than one parcel.
Acquiring the right to rule is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to wear banners or tie yourself up somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control his company.
Those who have obtained the right to control their blocks will receive precise location information, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
The website of the Foundation displays the names of the holders of rights on the same map where the parcel data of the land can be found.
The only risk Leviäkangas sees in its nature conservation procurement is that the foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of proprietary rights, but the Foundation has obtained its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on August 13-19.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most in big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and parts thereof were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August this year per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In some cities, the number of thefts doubles in proportion to the population compared to others," police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board describes.
Police are wondering why the city is at the forefront of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The prevalence of robberies can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the Police Board, is expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on which cities are studying and cycling.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the police are aware of slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 bikes a day, and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 bikes a year.
“It’s a lot of stuff,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are resolved.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases are also revealed in other investigations, for example, when stolen bikes can be found in an apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual bike models, Jopo is the most stolen, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not been reported to the police that the stolen bikes are going to go abroad," Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bikes are, according to the police, ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
Buyers of used bicycles must be careful, as they may be guilty of a concealment offence or a concealment offence.
"Alarm bells should ring if a good conditioned bike is sold at a clear price," says Reen.
Specialist Librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says the Deer. "Has never been stolen, has been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so tempting for thieves, it doesn't necessarily have a hipster value either," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to shop at a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike crawled against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks her bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"You hear from friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such scumbags."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve herself from the yard of a housing company a year ago.
But the bike had not been locked, so Valve could expect it to be stolen.
Under 15-year-olds responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki to test peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under 15 years of age, who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the jury will discuss the incident with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator himself can join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are being used in parallel.
“Everyone directs the young person’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t get ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is modeled in the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not have to face an adult panel, but reflects about what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu’s service design agency, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
Peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
The letter is addressed to the president of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channelled into congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that Donald Trump’s disagreements and his recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking disapproval threaten to bring a ballot of votes to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional election can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing every day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress” and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her economic policy on Thursday.
I'm running for president so that the US economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy is going well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure—roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich and partly by private money.
The construction program is a stretch to the American laborers, who are suffering as the factories move to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. to become a tax refugee, it will have to pay outgoing tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by the Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the Republican Donald Trump’s economic program on Monday that it “only favors this kind of millionaire.”
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cuts have previously been called “Trump’s loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the audience of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewer statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a high level of spectators.
At one time, the Games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at its best: on Tuesday night, the Olympics channel TV2 watched 615,000 viewers at the same time.
For comparison, the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday evening and gymnastics on the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator numbers and reminds us that the spectators will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of TV viewers who choose the Olympics in general.
On the television side, viewers are also distributed on TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference – most of Rio’s broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for slack interest - if it is considered slack - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first race, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, the spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competition, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the competition.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're about 200,000 now.
"We'll get the network's viewing numbers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked well for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has arrived and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been provided that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be more visible on Yle’s channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the races on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only the most laborious events in Yle’s history, but also the last ones that can only be watched from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be visible on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre depression in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which the dive computer showed a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the finding by sonar scanning.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says Jari Hakala, a development engineer.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are more than 80 metres long.
They haven't been studied as closely as the day.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unfamiliar deeps," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, your Päijänne will not be among the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14:29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax reduction: Pensioners’ tax remains tighter
Taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the misconduct was brought to light during the parliamentary elections and pensioners’ taxation was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The Government's proposal does not contain this.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received deductions that reduced taxation.
The issue was heated up in Parliament by opposition representatives who coalished Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Ecclesiastes), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power rather than increasing it, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don’t increase people’s insecurity.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Orpo about their desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done with the help of the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It becomes necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment must be tackled
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget racket, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will evade.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a huge social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known victims of the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night during Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
Finnish trips to Thailand take place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to contact Finns in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was adopted in referendum.
The referendum was not a transparent, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested who protested against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the last 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in tourist-famous Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded during the night in a tourist destination that is also popular with Finns, the holiday island Phuket, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured.
A total of four bombs exploded in Hua Hin yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Author of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling Thai military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
"We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the ambassadors regarding caution, says Westphalen.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish Night.
A little more information has been provided about the attack in Hua Hin last night.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There are at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded every half an hour or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles Wins Women's Quadruple
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman finished second with 60.098 points and the Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for standing championships at the Rio races on landscaping, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the fullest in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and the permanent championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States, Biles has won two World Championships.
The weaker World Cup medals in Biles are jumping and booming.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: “Isku has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be any more miracles,” says Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has witnessed many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If this hasn’t been the case for tourists, it’s not the case either.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and told me not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work as usual in the morning.
They thought roadblocks were put because of the queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the movements on the main street were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had never even heard of the attacks.
At 3:30 a.m. in Thailand, traffic in Patong had normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
This car was later seen in Kroonupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two characterized men hiding in a nearby spruce tree.
The other man was caught immediately.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and aggravated damage.
Police are thanking those who gave the hints.
Director of Research on Russian Leadership Changes: Clear Aside
On Friday, Russia’s highest-ranking leader changed over the years when President Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomatic and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of managerial positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating presidential power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten involved with other leaders or screwed up.
Defeat to Ivanov
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s inner circle, will take on special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for reassignment and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people on the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guards, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s seat that Putin switches to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in Syria retreat
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, but in fact, the civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Prof: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Director of Communications tells STT that there is a noticeable need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's Final Olympic Show Begins in Rio
Just like in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He broke his backbone and was forced to skip the Jamaica Olympics.
This hasn’t been a perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low dressed samba dancers and fan-changing journalists.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has been struggling with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympics came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-metre rounds with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by his injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 meters, breaking the world record and the competition's confidence in a time of 9.69, despite the final celebration.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the culmination of his career.
The world records of 9.58 at 100 metres and 19.19 at 200 metres are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but no one but Bolt himself believes it will happen.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Athens’ 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
At the Beijing World Cup last year, Bolt defeated the American by only one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals, if only he has made it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the 2011 World Cup final due to a fake start.
Bolt will turn 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the final finish line for next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive anti-doping test at the Olympics in Rio.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to your home for giving a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the 100-metre women's butterfly swim in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeals for Sport.
Xinhua said Xinyi’s sample on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other suspects of doping in Rio.
Bulgarian women’s runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had faked an athlete during the test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is a Kenyan sprint coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre race pass of Ferguson Rotich.
Nothing can stop Phelps - historical gold became a show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200-meter medley squad in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic gold medal in the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps won at 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," said Helen Skelton, a BBC Olympic swimmer, in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get too stressed if there’s a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he says.
Skelton has worn high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough revelation – at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, no rear steps are allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to thrill and maybe even thrill, but he insists he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the riot has reached Finland?
I can’t, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers are doing the job and how big the sacrifices they’re making is okay with me.
You know what, man?
It is an outcry from nothing, if it comes from dressing up.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police on Thursday said they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
In the same connection, police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members had already been arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police explode suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after they had controlledly detonated the package.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police controlled the package and exploded.
The audience did not reach the spectators by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the lobby.
The police blew up the package and let the public enter the hall only afterwards.
The drink woke up the Spanish team who started the games sleepily.
Spain defeated Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Police were forced to explode a suspicious find near the road cycling destination on Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match in the first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stadiums.
Argentinian lady sucks Petäjä-Sireni – Finn thinks about protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful race day in Rio.
The winds of Petäjä-Siren were very bad on Thursday.
An Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of women’s surfing day.
Winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He was stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away,” said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
It was not necessary to do so, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn was hanging on his board until the end because he didn’t want to get caught in Rio’s dirty water.
The Finn was ranked 27th in his departure due to a collision.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medallist is eighth.
When it comes to the tip, the collision didn't work much.
Friday is an important day when we have a 10-12 race.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Extraordinary Things Science Says Will Extend Your Lifetime
Science has studied everything that exists between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person has no control over can bring him more years.
These include, for example, a tendency to be obese or a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to waste your time – just get a can of milk.
The secret of long life has been investigated in a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially for neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily intakes - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can extend a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the development of other diseases in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found that laughter influenced a person’s life.
The project, which lasted seven years, monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
It will take a few more years, there is no denying that.
However, achieving a long life expectancy does not require unconditional slopingness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bum.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years into his life.
Some scientists suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over the age of 65 found that a person who shops daily was more likely to live as a parent than someone who shops less often.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may prematurely cause death.
So put down your credit card – online shopping doesn’t have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashes into truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskentä, midway between Koskenttie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car had hit the lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained upright in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car crashed into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was stuck in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test score was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post sent candy to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salo’s K-Citymarket’s candy selection, because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are shortcomings in the bulk goods, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
So unless there's traffic on the lawn mowing, the sign says.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is on Posti’s offer until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that this issue raises is unbelievable, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites in a candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for Posti’s Transport Services business, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages wandered into the wrong place (Seinäjoki) yesterday and we did not go to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three of them anymore, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Halti wasn't upset about the sign because she found all her own candy favourites.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 kilos, published a photo of her change
A comedian-producer has lost dozens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and television producer Lotta Backlund started her slimming project in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of pictures of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in her appearance over the years.
Backlund’s before and after photo pair has collected several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard! one glows.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel the same way, someone else tells me.
In the spring Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let's do it now project.
At that time, he told the Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was ten kilograms away at the time.
During the three-month fitness course, I finally lost five pounds.
Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the sake of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nurse training there.
The Veterinary Department remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor, and without fear of work.
My dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
Neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection.
A police dog, Börje, was involved in the tracing of the murderer, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to initiate a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgement, Posti could have withheld only part of the salary of an introductor, which corresponded to the part of the introductory work of the whole day.
According to the district court, an employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Association of the Postal and Logistics Industry Union (PAU)’s organisational decision on the prohibition.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not inspect temporary agency workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (c.) write in a reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Federation of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns about freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration - instead of Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s close inner circle, will move to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin’s statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for reassignment and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many saw Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was elected president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's buy-in banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record-breaker will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United’s Paul Pogba is suspended from the league when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Pogba to Italian club Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game because Pogba was banned from playing at Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event starring some of the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival guests have typically expressed themselves in a unique way.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which takes place this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind this success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It is quite unusual for people to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal is to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
Increasing the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance the activity in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge channels.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been enlarged, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partly decorated area of artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent for 15,000 people will be used as a venue for gigs this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even large visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "district things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive way.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost by content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 people were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers were foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek has tweeted a powerful picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran to me and told me that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon afterwards, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, also favored by Finns.
As far as I know, no one died.
At the same time, a second double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
The Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are dissatisfied with the actions of the Thai military.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been keenly involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby force will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to fight missions only after several months of taking an oath, Keskisuomalainen says.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Chief of Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the journal, for example, of the conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Training, reserve personnel from the standby force will be assigned first.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hefty fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and in court.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s legal and settlement expenses for a total of EUR 47,344.
The court granted a fair price reduction, as the purchasers had already known some of the repair needs of the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola searched for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the facts mentioned in the health check report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the inadequate management of rainwater and melting water flowing along the bedrock.
However, the discussions did not show that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the cliff might have to be controlled a little within a few years.
The purchases were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
During inspections in 2012 and 2013, microbial growth was detected in the building, which according to witnesses was due to both rocky rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mould or yeast that exceeds the limit values was found in brush samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window and the basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been modified in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home issues were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major renovations in the near future.
In the opinion of Tola and Waroma, the Court of Appeal had no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Scary archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - register includes Finns
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland have microfilmed records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German racial office.
Heinrich Himmler was the SS leader.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological examinations to clarify the issue.
The Finnish Racial Service investigated the background of women, among other things, by examining church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the family tree of women.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from their loved ones to the National Agency for Racism.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who spoke German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidizing children.
The German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Petäjä-Siren in the sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first start of the Finnjollies’ day at the Rio Olympics, but remained the tail of the whole group at the second start of the day.
The nirkko rose to the eighth place after five sets, but the failure of the second set brought him down to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day's starts at <0x23>17 and <0x23>3.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470th class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd at the start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpään’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours’ sleep: “I was so in a nutshell”
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, the bartender of the cruise ship, became the king of tango in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, is still struggling and is currently on a rampage.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer, was published today.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career rose to a total boom when he won the crown of the Tango King at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, at the request of a man, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so fucked!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn’t immediately guess that the song was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and perfection from yourself.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and the case ended up with the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songwriters ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, it was written based on the news in the 7-day magazine.
The reason for the divorce between Jari and his ex-lover was his excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and it wasn’t true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company furiously and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour of the resignation and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan of former US President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign “It’s the economy, stupid” flew to the trash in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curl language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the explanations for economists for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, i.e. almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it will boost the export industry.
In the opinion of the economist, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently demonstrated.
They were particularly harassed by the impartiality of the BBC, which gave as much room to EU-friendly economists representing only 2% of the economists as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what they thought of the consequences of the breakup: IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other economic capital combinations.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not have a common interest.
Academics in big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an Economy
The overwhelming win-win argument for Brexit was immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant congested your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments without them?
In every school there are children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get into school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every city.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to answer them and, if they succeeded, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues in health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are the net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drafting plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of a camp in favour of a withdrawal from the EU, began to be prepared more closely a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they might be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only open daily quoted real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even less.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trade
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors became nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trades for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to withdraw money in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you weren’t forced to withdraw your money now, it wouldn’t be worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He pointed out that there had been no similar upheaval in the Continental European funds in Aberdeen, for example.
But there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closure of real estate funds trades attracted unduly much attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures dominated about four per cent of UK real estate.
The shutdown of Aberdeen lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its funds close to 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been downgraded, but the situation does not seem to be "greater" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down on London’s real estate market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, real estate investment manager at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's a strong word in your head.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was already alive, despite the early hours of the morning.
The television screens, normally set to be silent in the office, resonated with the news, and usually the noisy crowd was completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens were all red.
“It was a morning you never thought you’d live on,” Vanhanen said.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. on Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market predicted drastic declines in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
Office space in London was projected to decline by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the thunder has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been reported.
CBRE’s data on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London’s office buildings accounted for a minus of 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All similar drops occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
This is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen believes that the comparison is not entirely correct, as we are dealing with a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
The repairs could have been done anyway.
In fact, he doesn’t think it’s a miracle that the price correction was going to happen – it could have happened even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimates, real estate prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have risen for four reasons, Vanhanen’s list.
Britain’s economy has grown strongly, London’s population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new assets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, debt leverage has now been used significantly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price rise levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was a turning point, and here it is.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He doesn’t dare to judge the future, but he says there’s hardly any upswing to come.
The mood indicates that there is a declining or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the holes can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much a victim.
If you are decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its loyal customers’ purchases.
When information has been collected so far on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in early May for the purchased products as well.
The S Group is following Kesko here, as the data on the goods purchased with the Plus Card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have forbidden the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group’s registration change.
Kesko categorises its loyal customers in ten groups according to their mere grocery purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information at product or group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know where the purchases were made in the store and on what day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level like K-Group or S-Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you about this later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
So far, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment are recorded.
In addition, the S-Bonus Partners’ information has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, data is recorded at product group level for the time being.
For a long time now, customers have been asking for more targeted marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partners.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
Anyone who is interested can check their stored data on S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - puppy will be the first explosive dog
A black labrador puppy is sniffing five similar boxes in line at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog to play with her favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of scented gunpowder gas shells were revealed.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for online shopping
Heila is Tulli’s first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The other main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs’ duties is postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, including arms and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs at Helsinki Airport has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons components, ammunition and explosives as well as their precursors.
Heila will work in different locations at Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In the future, ports will benefit greatly by being able to go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila are also training with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs decides, together with other authorities, what odors Heila is taught to recognize.
The pendulum is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli’s six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
You can't go anywhere without a Swing at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from the one-time law.
The cameraman in Evening Messages loses the mic cover of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover that looks like a soft toy immediately after the "remove" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, the passengers cannot come to iron the dog wearing the work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a working dog to Customs is approximately 6000-70000 euros per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire in the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are a fierce competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for the ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience with dogs and supervision tasks in Customs.
Mini-State Receives First Olympic Medal - People Have a Day Off
The Olympic gold in rugby in Fiji, which has less than one million inhabitants, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
The Fijian public broadcaster said that the Fijian government confirmed the case once the championship was cleared.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also festivities for the hero team in their home country.
The rugby team of Fiji celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up at the stadium.
Usually only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging," Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times reporter, told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at losing 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening property as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos in push and 145 kilos in drag.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with a fierce shriek.
The body shuddered under the weights until the jury approved the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was that he suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club has signed an end-of-season contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player who has the power to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With over ten player agents, we went through over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when Aleksandr Kokko, the lay king of the previous season, moved to Australia.
The Proud Modern Family Star Reveals Almost Everything: Teenage Star's Shorts Reveal
Ariel Winter, who is familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, once again blinks by showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts, which leave little to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much more courageous one.
The star has posed in very few clothes and taken numerous tattoos in the pictures she posted on social media.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of becoming an adult, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
The founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
"He's learned that the more the exposed surface looks, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood," Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has displeased some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downturn is already that hard,” said a woman on Winter’s Instagram account.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look gorgeous!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glow a young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to entice Japanese people to start their Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the key to our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for northern light trips in Lapland in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts in early autumn and continues until the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairytale, says Anne Lind, Vice Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more distinct unique sights from Finland, and the Northern Lights have enormous potential here, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as they did in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese spend 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
The UK is satisfied with rugby silver, with a master class organised by Fid leading to gold
Britain’s impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed on Fiji’s final challenge on Thursday night when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji arranged a master class in handling, bites, dodges, support game, running lines and pure force to win gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss came with a reasonable consolation from the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic Rugby inaugural tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 victory from South Africa in the semi-finals on the same day may have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
The fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow may -- but probably not -- comforts Britain: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England's boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the progress is startling.
Fidi started out with an excellent fight against British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running towards the buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dive into the finish area at the corner.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was only a slowdown for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal at the right corner, with Britain losing 17-0.
Nakarawa scored a new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the watch...first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvourou swept through the UK with loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the break, the score was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's actually what it is.
During the break, the UK made a number of changes that blocked the Fid dam...for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored a goal after Fid’s impressive assist.
Dan Norton scored a touchdown in the UK at the left corner and narrowed it down to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fid’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame with his last-minute paint was glazed in Fid's cake, which didn't need glazing.
They were whistling, the Fidians hugged, and Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the 20-5 semi-finals, and the UK won South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where they each scored one goal - a British goal kick determined the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goal poles in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of England's 15-sided rugby team, secured a victory and eventually a silver medal.
Coach's battle against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first draw to the last, with 220 hard strokes towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three voices on board, and the echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the two raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the Women's Doubles - the first women in the British sports history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th invincible appearance, which is also a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface with the grace of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Against the backdrop of every rowing gold, there is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually advance the things that matter. And no hand pair was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were fortunate to be able to start their treatment in early 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that phrase can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, Williams, who had had a nervous morning, was the first person to think, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, “I’ve been feeling devastated this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very attached in a moment.
Helen yelled, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and did not try to do anything special at the same time.
We weren’t looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good rowing and winning the race, and so we did.
They wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be at the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland Replaces Government Ruined by Panama Leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks have already called for in the spring.
The Panama Papers have revealed that many Icelandic politicians have evaded tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the autumn election result.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the ruling party was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest rumors.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the incumbent President, Barack Obama, would be the founder and Democratic candidate of ISIS, Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious and asked for an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink so low become commander-in-chief of the army,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-favoured burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a good manners and a secular swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely expresses religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two extremist-linked men attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screen - Pyykösjärvi blue-green algae dew
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae has been observed on the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and Enterococcus concentrations in the waters of Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae precipitation observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, whereby blue-green algae mass is formed on the surface of the water.
The environmental action monitors the situation with more frequent inspections.
If blue-algae precipitation turns into blue-algae flowering, the bathing area notification board will also be notified separately.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational renewal of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational renewal of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax amendment proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s net capital income.
It is capital income after deduction of all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Forestry starts from this, by making a deduction from the net capital income of forestry, it prevents that it would result in a loss on the capital income of forestry, which would be deductible in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if they did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only to a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit of the tax deduction tied to the profit value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
In VM it is considered that the border guarantees the goal of growing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken away in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hailstorm surprises car drivers in Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rear-end on the Himanga in Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Service, two cars in a row crashed into a ditch, after which the driver in the rear collided with the driver in front.
According to the firefighter Harri Pyyhtiä, who is on duty, the fall into the ditch is suspected of being caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 a few kilometres from Himanga towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings by researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the severity of the cancer increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medications by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos family home murder continues at court, prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another offender
Muhos family home death continues at court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family in Muhos.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of murder was also convicted of seriously endangering traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle as an unauthorised young person.
The judgement of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the defendants and the man who had received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a milder sentenced man be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, a 17-year-old youth killed a man who worked as a child welfare supervisor at a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the director from behind on the living room couch.
The pilot had gotten off his grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state study, both of the convicted were in full understanding at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to flee the family home at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, growing only at the age of 156.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the hawk can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until the age of 156.
The ice shark’s life expectancy is increased by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found the age by radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or the other could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Up to a third of the country’s total tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed corporate tax change was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially through tax relief for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as “revolutionary” when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without it, we would be missing a huge sum of <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump is 33.
Inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
Urgently decided environmental standards must be reintroduced and the energy sector should be deregulated.
Barack Obama’s health care reform must be reopened.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The “destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty and from Mexico to a 35% penalty.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch over the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see Trump’s program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early Friday.
The Tsunami of the Past - People's News
The sea is turbulent, but the real tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid's thunderstorm - a reconciliation with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous directing work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and junk-sided satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin in which I Live (2011), the peaks of a Spanish artist’s career.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the same for the middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the movie.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist will be Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher.
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be regarded as cucumbery, but I would say quite cunningly and literally with a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and the often characteristic blasphemy of Almodóvar films.
It is an evenly played, restrained, and in some places with good music, and a rather sad film, which as such contains elements of elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is preserved, so that it gradually begins to catch the eye as a purely formal thing rather than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are afflicted by illness, death or otherwise only sudden loss, but the surface remains equally cool.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the named person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for the spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the current scene, are not much better than this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly spiritless.
Almodóvar wrote the screenplay based on three short stories by the 2013 Nobel laureate Alice Munro.
The novels have been published in The Fugitive: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, and the result is a somewhat equitable literary filmmaking.
The materials would have been emotionally incomparably more robust in the drama, so big things – especially the guilt that eats away – the theme of the movie deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premieres on 12.8.
The government is trying to beat the election - Kansan News
No further cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns of the core do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in bulk.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (ec.) say under the budget.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
The child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Educational cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why are ministers so eager to insist that they should not be subject to further cuts?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen in the past that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, according to the polls, the ruling party expects the Finns to lose their vote, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new delegates, a large part of which will be paid for influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of about the same size depends on the ability of the Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
The “no new cuts” rhetoric obscures the fact that next year they will be made drastically, and secondly, attempts are being made to soften the pending attack on the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The Government has set the target of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take on 5.9 billion euros of debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own agenda: debt is not breaking or even slowing down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be rolled out at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what will happen will be adopted.
With these measures, indebtedness will not be broken
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be broken, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget press conference prove this irrefutablely:
The forecasts for global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no drawbacks from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has hardly recovered since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent during this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be about six billion euros, which will be covered practically entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the central, coalition and basic Finns’ perception of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipality
Three out of four consider that the organisation of childcare, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also devolve responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management to individual municipalities.
The responsibility of the county, in turn, is most clearly intended for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for mentally handicapped persons.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Drunk driver runs away after chasing police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol into Joensuu on Friday night at half past half past one o’clock.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle driving without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonkajanranta road, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Still after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-legged policeman ran after the fugitive.
A blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious risk to road safety.
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi at Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curve to the left and had fallen sideways into a ditch.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door, together with the personnel of the rescue helicopter and the paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was poured into the road from the fallen truck and sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a 165-centimeter-tall, slender, well-mannered woman with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and hints about the missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre hotline number 0295440513.
Ingredients of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest disasters
The fall of the Parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, the chairman of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last Parafest performer Kalle Salonen performed on the stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
A downflow occurs in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward flow of air.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm bind heat, and thus the decreasing air mass cools and accelerates towards the earth.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, several downturns occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the trajectory of the surge.
The flood hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was a child who was transported to a hospital with minor injuries.
Air Pollution Is Ageing Londoners
According to research, Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The study was published in the Evening Standard.
British skincare company CACI analyzes London’s most toxic air particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of their peers in rural areas.
Fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk their way to work near busy streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, using different masks, but a more practical solution is regular skin cleansing.
The tractor's brakes were broken. He pushed the man in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor brakes broke and the tractor dripped on him.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor pushed him enough to be taken to the central hospital for further examinations, with serious injuries.
The tractor could not drain any further, as it hit the rocks in front.
With new strengths for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Finnish Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from better starting points than in human memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone is definitely better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
The midfielder Fred Musoni starts his second term in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Rwandan national player Nelson is a 205-inch chopper.
Garchet is a passier, while the Brazilian is 198 cents.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys for the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth edition of the competition is now underway in Tampere, only in 2013 was Canada missing out after being better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a national team.
I’m interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth City, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball at the Finnish Championship level.
Played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoji in Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in the 1991-92 season, followed by three seasons in Josba.
While playing, he trained the A-Girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in women's Finnish Championships, accumulating a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen appointed to the national team
Josban from Joensuu was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen from Eno was chosen to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking in Helsinki, has played six men’s national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team’s standard team with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Suomi shirt at the World Championships last December, was also appointed to the national team.
The head coach of the National Floorball Team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley player Essi Krusu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be settled this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
For three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Kouvola Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Nowadays Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, looks forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at Pessis stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region lit up the spark of the Krusty for sport and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are memories of childhood in my mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at Elimäki NMKY E-girls.
The main thing is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that spin on the ankles, as well as amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were very active - the teammate’s father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice of sports in junior years.
The beach of Kõrälampi has been playing a bite since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM-tournament competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksmäki resident Anniina Parkkinen in the SM-finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked team in the tournament is clear.
Our realistic goal is a medal.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
By the way, the toe shoes are put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Tents were knocked down by a surge at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near

Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-call firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, told the newspaper that the situation had elements for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Two years ago Koli and her younger brother Valtteri Koli started to work as the continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in handy from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If you want to start something, you have to do it properly and seriously.
In 2013, we started building a yard boat, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project very bravely and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would be fine.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of the Rural Future Magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows its approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit into Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public records.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized for promoting a blackface mask or for preferring a bleached skin color as a beauty idea.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and chunky cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people—the “yellow face” or yellow face.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies could be a sign of the company's bigger problem with diversity.
News and outrage spread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said it had shut down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for racist-experienced observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison between an outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degrading.
Snapchat is not the only company that surpasses these cultural trap wires.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse audience of young people than their parents could mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image, “it’s much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a letter to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that race-related disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white male leadership and ended his article with the hashtag <0x23>DeleteSnapchat (<0x23>RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," said Zhu, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak frankly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss its staff’s racial background, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and push ahead with internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, “I think they actually need more users like us to say this isn’t okay.”
Congress panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, the Congress panel said the authorities from the U.S. Armed Forces Military Headquarters have shaped intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House Defense Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Budget Subcommittee found “widespread dissatisfaction” among headquarters intelligence analysts, who said superiors thumped their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Military Division in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than was justified by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses produced by other agents in the intelligence community," the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable — our fighters suffer in the war when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision makers,” Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that high-ranking administration officials in the Obama administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts feeling pressured by Centcom leaders to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
Centcom officials, for example, publicly stated that a large-scale attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence officers at the U.S. Armed Forces Military Operations Headquarters manipulated HQ intelligence outputs to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence from the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, follows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense has opened an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process that was unduly isolated from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief democrat, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs, worsened the mood among analysts, and did not give enough room for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector-in-chief investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The investigation has other implications than just the question of whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria will be successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of the war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State Intelligence reflects a controversy over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article that said that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic state-run refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
US wins fourth consecutive women’s field hockey match with UK
The day after scoring three goals for the team defeating Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympics and they will share their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have reached the quarterfinals, and this game determines who will finish first and who will finish second in their group of six teams.
The first-place finisher avoids a strong Netherlands, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the Americans have stirred up a riot with their surprising success here, four years after they missed out on the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up at the Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey club for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played for Drexel) when he joined the national team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a complete reversal.
On Thursday night, Bam started to score the first half with knuckles close to the goal.
India had come up with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball long on the left side of the field, then twisted into the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored a final goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the tournament's first for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, "but its goodness will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are underway.
What is happening in Rio de Janeiro seems to be a constant and unavoidable message of fierce competition and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming chapel passed from archer to swimmer and from gymnast to triathlet.
It’s impossible to turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in a cafeteria queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic athlete and future heartbreaker with a smiley pit, could well be one of the names everyone knows that are presented at the best time of the day, supported by sponsorship agreements and cheerful TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, in part in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the subtle charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, there have been so few observations of its presence over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not progress to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's medals, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
The trampoline, however, has a certain underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics to an uncivilized ear.
Here I have to admit that I’m not an expert, I’m just a fan of flying.
There are opportunities for amusement, as can be seen from the endless bounces of cartoon movies, but there is also the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming, two species that basically combine.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means springboard.
The championship-seekers jump on a giant trampoline up to 30 feet high, performing spinning sequences (turns, folds and volts) and finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged by execution, difficulty and "flying time".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries competing in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those wishing for a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only the finish line or the start wall, but also, in the television news, another grim border: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical – and can even bring the spectator to tears.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, seeming weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no furious rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as the Olympics can get.
The women’s qualifying competition and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon when the broadcast starts at 1 p.m. (ET), while the men’s competition will also take place on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely will not be noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only reached by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spreading videos recorded during demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security officials are striking young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much assistance from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously, and there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken of repression of the government, the country's opposition has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to protest, that will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher in Central Ethiopia.
All young people are demonstrating.
A generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the strangulation of power by the ruling coalition.
After the much-criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat held by the opposition and now occupies all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the border with Eritrea, and the battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the upheaval and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil beneath the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amharic, get along better.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharic people, who came mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest protests have taken place in the Amharic and Oromo regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, who make up about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to harm opponents.
"The current regime does not have such a basic instinct," conflict analyst Abdi said.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the tiger-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands of people protested for elections that, according to analysts, appeared to have been first robbed and then robbed by the government.
In the ensuing strike, many demonstrators died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing disdain of the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it begins to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned companies, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed the base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable allies to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing."
Donald Trump Explains Obama-Based Isis Claims as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump attempted to suppress the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday, claiming he wasn’t serious when he repeatedly urged this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American audience.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in an awkward position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at a campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump insisted the same with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday’s interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
In an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was a complete reversal from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was actually serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took him in his ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign in the midst of declining poll results.
Trump and Clinton were fighting over the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the issue.
When he fled Twitter again, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to speak politically at the borders and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' in one direction or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language use of both candidates.
But I also think he’s cunning about his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of softening his speeches for the large polling audience, Trump has been even more blunt in recent days as his popularity continues to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is significantly behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, put a lot of effort into defending the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, totally wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter his attack on the news media, which grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to get him out of the way, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a sloppy, cash-only place in Williamsburg that did not have a wireless network, but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the streetside on Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the last loss in a city to be restored to a middle class.
“New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same supplier of bagels and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
It even used the lights of the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches and covers with capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They no longer serve beer, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old loyal customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers, too," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered to a cafe.
He says that when Verb closed, he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed the coffee and culture of the Verb," he said.
Now she has returned to her coffee, although that day she ordered a mixed chai drink instead of her regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, visited the Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to work there, and he always made the same order.
"Every day at 5pm and 7pm, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagels with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes for the sake of variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old farms.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb which would use the cold-extracted coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to soon put it out somewhere to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was uncomfortable when the place closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home while walking inside and ordering a coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: the paralyzing food of the depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated foods of Fifth Avenue, such as the Goose Liver Steaker, and Maryland’s marsh turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and dessert with plum pudding.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with the people who are suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in an apartment building in the Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at a dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpretentious lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meat loaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating during the depression.
"The worries were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut nuts, liver nuts, bean nuts.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that was used to extend the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead in my stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-so-many-as-yaks-to-take-ups.
Women’s groups cooked food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The book A Square Meal chronicles the way in which the nation coped with the fact that suddenly it was no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery foods such as breadcrumbs and boxes became the main foods, and the box was “a great way to use leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried, with calories and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research also for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman clarified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgetaries” and to meet the challenge of turning blobs like cured spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let Me Eat Cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowa country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in the almost gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "did not only offer one of Washington's most miserable foods, but also the most miserable ones."
Many of the depressed eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land recovered.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she was unable to throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed their spoons in a sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sang once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, “slightly chopped walnuts could help.”
Gilead to be reimbursed for his hepatitis C patent against Merck
The U.S. District Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. be entitled to the lawyer’s expenses in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from <0x24>200 million in fees for violating two of Merck’s patents relating to Gilead’s success drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. This exemption followed a U.S. judge’s discovery of Merck’s misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to a waiver of any compensation it received in opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work behind Gilead’s pharmaceuticals ingredient sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
The northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, has been completely occupied by U.S.-backed forces since the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Allied Forces, Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"We now have full control of the city, but we have started to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made <0x24>10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse earned <0x24>10.75 million in income that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speaker’s allowance, and the former Secretary of State announced that he received <0x24>3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book announcing his career at the State Department.
Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife Anne Holton published a 10-year tax return.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawing his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for presidential candidates in the United States to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans calling on Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the past few decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little tax in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday saying that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than <0x24>1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has a tax administration audit underway, and that Trump is not “fearing” the tax collecting agency, but the voters.
Clinton’s campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only <0x24>100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton announced <0x24>109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili Powder Condoms and Fireworks to Boost Tanzania’s Elephant Protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the idea was developed several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation in collaboration with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy to enhance its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without hurting animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...tools, we’ve noticed a change in attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps involve pointing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it does not stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and a lighter, after which the condom is twisted so that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts into flames and explodes chili powder into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
As a last resort, there is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code, according to the employee, this is due to “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the country code list offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker brought the matter up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from there "shocked him".
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay at the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli area code," Lanzmann said.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a “great injustice,” Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But what is even more disgraceful is that this has happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident generated quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “given in” to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," another publication said, pointing out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "inattention" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"The clear order not to include Israel on the shortcut list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman said, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest government reforms in public education.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement attempted to dismantle the student body, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror of the plans.
Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of Sao Paolo state, suggested that fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after protesters mobilised as a group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who had been suspended from office, as the Senate voted on her impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran grows 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of the trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, says Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have to a large extent shown interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, totalling USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5%, totalling <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
"Trade growth was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner tossed to the finish line as the British took the cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's trio defended their 2012 championship from London.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played an anchor role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, and the legend was proud of the young man as he raced to the finish line to win the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly finishing sixth at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man that British coaches held on to in view of the potential of Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was close behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving at a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and to make a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
There can be no better way to win.
After defeating Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his remarks, and Britain’s rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like being in London with so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven of the ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will have five successful days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s condition, it’s not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny—who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this apparently sacred day in the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister)—the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this one.
Team competition is always the best.
We win it together with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the title of a knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest in a four-kilometre team-back race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 London gold medal-winning world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the race, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a quarrel with the judges yesterday before the qualifying, when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in the world record time with the clock stopping at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to rely on its mighty track cycling team to take over the center of the Olympics and achieve a host of medals.
After demonstrating exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been undermined before the Rio Games.
The background has been drama, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for sexism and temptation charges, as well as the end of the racing career of protagonists such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation to peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland’s melting future is questionable due to cuts in electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria's aluminum smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity company that is distributing electricity to the factory revealed that one of the plant's owners is terminating the distribution agreement, so a cut in all the distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian administration not to extend the subsidies required to maintain the plant in operation.
The 20-year period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter is losing money and under threat of closure.
The operation now follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to terminate their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity needs of the smelter will continue," he said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to be profitable in the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible profit impacts on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently constrained by strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by <0x24>187 million "in anticipation of closure."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “will not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or secure the smelter’s electricity supply.”
The company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the contract was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, that would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and the fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the desired September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and model for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a curious (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone's favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but which ended in a classic twist.
It's a cliché plot of almost every children's "birthday" television series (Seacrest says the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have definitely entered the new Kardashian era with the Vogue seat in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue first (shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own category.
Vogue’s September issue is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year’s 832-page purchases contained advertising content).
The unveiling of the cover star is so much awaited that for the past two years, photos of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have actually been more “celebrities acting as models” on the cover than “models that are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary title.
But if Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "successful model" of his generation, were to hit the first category, he would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s youth who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about it).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, the cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
This feeling came to the surface again with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But being dissatisfied is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the payment wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Every year 160 000 people are deported by the Community's legal centres
Every year, the most vulnerable in more than 160 000 people are disqualified from Community legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, already stretched to the limits of the Community, are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not revoked, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need each year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with unmanageable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly disfellowshipped workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate through complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise the funding of legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and its client communities, and the Palaszczuk Board should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's Campaign Sued After Employee Allegedly Threatened With Gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign’s chief of operations in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun in February while driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainee Vincent Bordin in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that “it would not happen.”
Chief Earl Phillip "takes out a pistol, puts his right index finger on the trigger and pushes the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the suit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in a statement.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate provoked anger when he told the public in North Carolina that “people of the Second Enhancement” — usually comprising gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not in favour of violence.
Bordin’s challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to the request for comment immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we put a tremendous effort into ensuring that all our people and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just like before the 2012 London Games, some people come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, which was built between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will also be one.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former commercial secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that earn money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad blocking program are a “cat and mouse game,” said one of the companies that produce such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its PC-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update the filters of the program to block ads on their social network pages again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that the code on its website will be changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “the kind of back and forth battle between the community blocking open source ads and its bystanders has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that there is a possibility that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much trouble advertising blockers have become in the industry.
Globally, around 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, nearly four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is after ad blockers on computer-based pages, as mobile ad blockers don’t work in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, a spokesman said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider such an action worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that the new filters on Adblock were worrying because they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad Blockers are boring tools, which is why we’ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway due to suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after the woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
She committed a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who apparently attempted suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, calling on them and all witnesses to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It is up to the prosecutor to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases — both of which involved a person walking on a dark highway — it was estimated that drivers could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were acquitted on charges of negligence in the death penalty after hitting and killing a man lying on A! Road near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court noted that the police responding to the emergency call drove in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday’s incident near Morges should call the police at +358 21 644 83 46 or +358 21 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if there could have been Earth-like conditions on Venus with its hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide filling atmospheres.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
There were probably drier areas on the planet than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to allow life and protect it from rapid water evaporation.
The early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s current.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably habitable at some point, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the position of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey, citing a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice President and Head Coach of the Colorado Avalanche Hockey Department with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Throughout the summer I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach’s and vice president of hockey affairs’ vision must be fully in line with the organization’s vision.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013 thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not made it to the next round in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the 2015–16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference Wild Card Playoffs.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Workers in the North Sea for wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged at random on North Sea rigs run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT Alliance can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process aimed at resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent collective struggle, which they say will be the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, the Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ remuneration by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration reduction follows a 10 per cent reduction in contractors in the country in 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to quit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than <0x24>1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average over the past five years has been around <0x24>7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The most recent mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at varying speeds and how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age and even its solar system history," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now at their highest level.
At its peak rotation speed, these mature stars push large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sun spots.
The latest list of stellar rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones making pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for estimating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian Star Cluster provides an anchor to theoretical models of stellar rotation that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
