I stopped to talk.
I study about two hours a day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've packed your bags and you're ready to go.
I must have heard that sound somewhere before.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Do you do dangerous work?

It's not over until we're done with it.
I'll take his place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
She might be better off with your sister.
It goes hand in hand with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
Clearly freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow did not stop.
I don't care if you're coming.
It's all right.
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the day before.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That was on the day of our marriage, darling.
There must have been a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
This happened while he was out.
It's happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.

I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
There is very little chance, in my opinion, that you will be able to do it on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.

I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I think, so I drink.
I think, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.

I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.

I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it didn't turn out to be.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened my neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under its influence.
It really impressed me.
It's an accident!
This is a historical play.
It is difficult to put into practice what was said.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It’s time to start a new business.
It is important to promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's amazing.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to be prepared for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be switched off.
This is not the best way.
That's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one that Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's inappropriate to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad weather today.
It's so expensive.
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
This is useful information.
It's hot at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing your baby’s diapers.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready by the time you need it.
It'll be ready when you have to.
It will take you some time to get used to wearing glasses.
It's going to wear off soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not having a good time here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
He needs to be washed.
It's got to mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
It needs to be repaired.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I was going to do the best I could.

I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen.
I told you, I'm fine.

I have a question too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the bathtub for a long time.
I've arranged.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I travelled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried my best to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep up-to-date.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-haired cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a watchdog.
It's half an hour before lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right now.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already underway.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's a pity that Tom is leaving.
It's a pretty big stick.
It's a rumor.
It's ice cold.
It is as much an art as it is a science.
It's a thing of the past.
She's at school.
It is a very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injuries.

It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a tiring day.
It's a tough day.
It's happened before.

It's cold at home.
It's cold, I'm goosebumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get a sweater?

It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
That's perfectly normal.
All right, now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
It's delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
It looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Apparently.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
It seems to me that you're being honest.
Looks like you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's awkward to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
It's far from perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
He's freaking out.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a tough winter.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
Good for studying.

His head is disproportionately large.
He's tall.
The kids should be in bed.
Stop scattering money!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
This is important.
It is important that parents are on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It is important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
Inability to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's pretty heavy.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's getting late.
Laundry today.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles, rays, and sharks above it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me! It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This is not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
Not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
What matters is not what you do, but how you do it.
It's not worth complaining about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to a priest if you don't repent.
There's no point in grieving about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
Absolutely impossible.
Obviously weird.
Obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think you're a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
“Three months have passed, and Tomi is already saying that he speaks French fluently.” “Well, he’s at the peak of his stupid ass.” “What peak?” — Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over. It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring like it's poured out of a dish.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite evident that the purpose of these myzantropic theories is to defame the working class, acquitting imperialism of the responsibility for the bloody wars it has provoked, and sowing the seed of the idea that the innate aggressive tendencies of man are the cause of endless wars.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much money they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
It is technically possible.
This is the best book I have read so far.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
That still needs to be answered.
It's time for us to pick up our tents.
Time to get out of here.
It's time for us to go.
Time! Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut by now.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It is high time we did something about this.
It's Tom's birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive for me.
It's too hot for this.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical autumn time.
A cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's striking yellow and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't run me in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
Nothing serious is likely to happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's really boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.

It took me more than a month to recover from a cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took him a long time, but he finally found it.
I turned into a small alley.
I've paged.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had fun yesterday.
At first it was hard.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy to keep my promise.
That was an underbelt punch.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault, believe me.
It wasn't that bad.
This was not the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only knew his true intentions when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
He was successful.
That was great.
That's all I could think of.
It was the worst pain I have ever experienced.
Tom was next.
They kept it completely secret.
He was unsure if he would marry her.
That was urgent.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It'll all be over in a few days.
It will take five or ten years for the technology to be ready.
It's going to grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It's gonna rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
Works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
I'm having a hard time getting out of here.
It would be pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
That's not bravery. That's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
I underestimated Tom.
Yeah, right.
I understand it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't affect me.
I understand your problem.
I've updated my software.
I need a job right now.
I used to be able to, but I can't anymore.
I used to be married.
I used to drink a lot of cola, but now I only drink water.
