28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on a staircase at a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to harm his brother.
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old from San Francisco.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said the death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small, close-knit team, like a family. We miss being big," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
According to Louis Galicia, Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally put things in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
“He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to make food for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked along the river.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was a rough diamond that shone every day,” he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the incident is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department’s hotline number 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (which in Finland are mostly responsible for specialised doctors) have appealed to their union and asked for permission to take further collective action in the dispute over a new employment contract.
The junior medical committee (JDC), which is a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling on its entire government to support further collective bargaining from early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the votes cast were against the agreement.
On Thursday night, Ellen McCourt, chair of the Junior Medical Committee, tweeted a letter to members of the JDC, saying that the government “remained stubborn” on issues that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted against the whole new draft treaty and demands that all our concerns be formally renegotiated.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC board has today submitted a formal request to the BMA board requesting permission for progressively expanding industrial action from the beginning of September.”
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete work stops ever seen in the history of the UK’s public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of the BMA's junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
At the meetings before the vote, Malawana told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would enter into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of foreigners?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to reach out for reconciliation and formally end the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation in Ankara.
The parties shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin and he didn’t get much warmth out of him, even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr. Putin – according to a report, five times.
I personally did not keep up with the calculations.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally saw his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian head of state has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing that Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin attacked Ankara and accused him of being stabbed in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
Among the most serious were the accusations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has denied the allegations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to get Putin’s demanding apology from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to gain some sort of victory.
The benefits of declaring an armistice in Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends since he was almost overthrown last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic reason for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the ban on charter flights, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will surely sigh with relief when air traffic can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
“Tomatoes back here, tourists there, tomatoes back here,” wrote the magazine Vedemost in an article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West reacted gently to the coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old resentment about Turkey’s snail-speed EU accession negotiations and Putin’s interference, who is eager to take advantage of cool ties and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit, Russia and Turkey were able to transmit the image of what one analyst described as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and ill-treated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It tells us a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the two countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries as to where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by Turkey, a NATO member country, when it shot down a Russian fighter aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State should at least be back in line.
Royal Bank of Scotland Banks Disappear from Customers Outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced to providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its targets when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sport, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWest, except for the head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff demonstration in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS is turning into an investment brand and the person our staff are working for because we are now turning into a bank of much more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our ambitions are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because it's basically a question of how we can make a bank better for customers," said the bank's president.
“Three years ago, it would have been very ridiculous if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and adopted brands.
But the work we do and our focus on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rides Predilection to victory at Newmarket and achieves his 3,000th victory
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, marking his 3,000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice on the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races on a flat track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson have made the same move.
Three-time master jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is exactly where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not big, not Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with an audience of 20,000 people.
I’m relieved and I feel very humble.”
Dettori receives cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle racing, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the time, and it’s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached.
She is elegant and strong, but her tactical prowess is what sets her apart.
He is a fantastic representative for racing riding, and his enthusiasm and qualification has brought fans to the sport for years."
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 races if he hadn’t competed only on weekends and only in the big races!
Seriously, Frankie’s equestrian career in the British Games has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to watch.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all, he is an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in an emblematic way by flying off his horse.
“From flying finishes to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996, the "Magnificent Seven", but also survived a plane crash and was banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had initial start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable character strength, showed his skeptics and returned to his best.
And he won’t be quitting his career for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his career until at least 50.”
Putin fired head of state Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly fired his chief of state, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putin’s trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a statement by the Kremlin, President Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his post as the head of the Russian presidential administration,” but the reasons for his dismissal were not disclosed.
Anton Vaino, who has served as Deputy Chief of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the president’s protocol department and the government office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: “I am grateful for your trust.
In my view, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB past.
As an administrator, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Were they fired as a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official allegation that a man who is praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
On the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov’s words to Putin are: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I have served as Presidential Administrator for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin served as the head of the replacing Federal Security Service (FSB) of the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the task went to one of Putin’s closest associates, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent incident at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.
“We had creative differences.
I’m sorry this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously starring in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, the 54-year-old Gibson has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement.
“I hoped to see the series until the end, but it’s not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and the most important ones: the best fans the series could have ever hoped for.”
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious landing of fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are sandeels that have been sucked into the land by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 yards from the seaside, published footage of the sight on Periscope, hoping to get an answer to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry Crossing Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now set to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and the ground bridge of the Queensferry crossing bridge, which means the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "cover flaps", which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now set to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of State for the Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly remarkable step forward in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel being used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now almost 79% in place, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete deck drainage in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted in place."
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “Completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine pole in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the cutting edge of the construction industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower, we had to close the remaining north (i.e., land-side) gap.
This was done by pulling a north-facing road bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very precise operation.
Massive because the bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
And requiring high precision, because the tolerances the team had to adhere to were very small – only a few millimeters.
Thankfully everything went well.”
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department Reports Three Men's Miracle Rescue
Three men were rescued from their fishing boats off Anglesey by a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station issued an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew spotted an accident in the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued recklessly without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, driving the lifeboat at Moelfre.
"By the time we got to the waters, fortunately strong winds had driven the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted, clinging to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken on a coastal lifeboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men who were trapped in the water are still alive and in perfect health.
The boat’s engine had an emergency fire extinguisher cord, but it had, for some reason, been detached from the man driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky in their journey.”
Pokémon Go Hunting Brings Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and move on.
Originally, screen time took only watching TV, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it’s amazing to see that technology and outdoor exercise don’t exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game application with characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made into a series of cartoons, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped shortly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Launches in other countries were delayed due to huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones in search of Pokémon that are tracked by GPS. Once found, the Pokémon can be "photographed" (with the help of a phone screenshot) or "captured".
Wildness has dragged a generation that played a video game younger and lifted their butts from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps a "average" person takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch Smartwatch Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people who move 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn’t know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns encouraging people to get up from the couch and move around for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health benefits – exercise, fresh air, and the sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also involves disapproving spoilers of joy.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What's that about?
The breakthrough is done.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could have tracked your activity earlier, they didn’t give you any reason to get moving, like Pokémon Go does.
The attraction of novelty disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people who go hunting and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Easy on the boom.
Jaws slap on the permafrost.
Brilliant in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver-launched "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles will perform on the boom at the multiplayer final of the Women's Gymnastics Singles Championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row and the fifth ever to win the multiplayer championship, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final score came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new level and puts it in the same category as other sports superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been the ultimate champion for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals, and earning them with programs so ambitious and precise that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one final race, which was mostly between Biles and himself and the burden of overexpectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman from the United States will hold gold and silver in the multiplayer final of the Women's Gymnastics Singles Championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of I for the farewell of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and is now retiring.
Although Biles claimed he had never thought of anything ahead of time when he was at the top for a long time, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program—which includes a series of volts known as his trump card—is adapted to Latin music that could well be heard in the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The adoption of his grandparents and the discovery of coach Aimee Boorman's mother have become a powerful figure. Boorman found her when she was on a daycare excursion to the gym where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multiplayer competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead with two spirals, it was like a canvas.
What remained was the boom and the permanent, where Biles is the defensive world champion.
He got back to the lead position after getting 15,433 points from the boom and crowning the result with 15,933 points from the floor.
Raisman gently hugged him while they waited for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ glittering red, white, and blue cropping color when his dream, once written in his clipboard, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge on the race four years ago, when he first shared third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-lap.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "grandma", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the audience after his permanent show and thus emerged from a losing position to a winning position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
When it comes to Bales, the widespread tweeting of this 19-year-old earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police say victim of three serial killers listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, while the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, police said Thursday.
Authorities said on June 12 that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car.
Police suspect that the triple murder was not caused by the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the police are investigating whether the killing was related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two wounded in nine attacks in areas mostly populated by Hispanics in the last four months.
"The events have in common that they have occurred in residential areas outside the homes," Howard told KPHO earlier this month, a subsidiary of CBS.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were killed at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the three of them had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police released a statement stating that the shooting of an empty van had taken place just half an hour before the triple killing, and that the shooter was believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found casings and recovered a bullet from the car seat and fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a congenital microcephaly due to a genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, of which he was unaware when pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn’t make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I wasn't committed to this.
Which isn’t at all true – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing the child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was such a practice anymore," Picciuto says.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund sat down and didn't start to stammer until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces a sign invented by Edmund, with which she means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it is not just a common sign language, it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or prenatal viral infections such as measles or zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
“I kept saying, ‘What will happen to us?’
What will happen to us.”
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Rains and floods cause massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
Louisiana's governor on Friday declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooded over their banks and spread across a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to flooding areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Response Office, said the agency was receiving requests for flooding vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to an announcement by the weather service, there may be an additional 76-127 mm of water entering the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are projected to rise to record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the riverside may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says the floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state border, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson County, Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepdaughter were among the rescued on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other son-in-law, who lived nearby, had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with a constant feed," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
She had told Hansford that she had never seen a river so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford explains that he and his family are all injured and that he is the only one who can swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three in a large army-style truck and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
According to an observer near Livingston, it had rained about 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was heavily wetted after the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding of the streets forced residents of Tangipahoa County to be rescued from their homes and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County chief Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
Shelters have been opened for evacuated people in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get back to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
Nearly twenty streets in the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, had to be closed due to flooding, and the residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a major flood was in March," said Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Council.
"This flood seems to be the same."
The rains in Mississippi continued to be steady along the Gulf coast, according to Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy said that a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no one had been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before, and it’s raining all the time.”
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, another six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that he was Mahaj Brown.
According to his grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the television station.
"I can't believe this is happening."
He is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television station that they believe the boy will survive.
He started first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The other 29-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a critically ill 29-year-old.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault gun-type casings, which came from various assault weapons.
“It is clear that this was a battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting,” police chief Anthony Ginaldi told a television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
There have been no arrests, and it is reported that the police are reviewing surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old victim of a shooting in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a misguided bullet while playing outside her home in West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
This is what I call the women’s gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team’s composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise winner, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the amazing achievements of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and their amazing and masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win a gold medal in the Women's Singles Championship.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The views are at the top of the sport, but they do not look the same in gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practise mainly in private gymnastics clubs run by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The facilities of most gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas, which are able to support the activity.
The training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs and represents a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts’ families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both been coaching athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible gymnastics classes for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organisations have offered free or low-cost gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic), some of whom have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities in my hometown of Detroit to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Artificial gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has stirred the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and that’s absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real “girl power” you showed when you won the Olympic gold medal and for motivating so many young girls from so many different backgrounds to start their journey into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to remuneration and working conditions by approving a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), the trade union representing doctors, but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force an agreement, saying the UK’s public health system was “no one’s land” and that any further delays would be damaging to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move on to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in asocial times.
Yesterday evening, Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Junior Medical Committee, made a statement in which she said: "Junior doctors remain very cautious about the proposed agreement, especially because of the fear that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has reacted reluctantly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
This is despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt made a promise that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors will be ready for further industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointment times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strike doctors.
The ministers hoped to bring the dispute over the amendments to an end by concluding a renewed agreement with the representatives of the union of British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors affected by the contract.
NHS employee chief Daniel Mortimer urged junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: “Working efforts achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already at the extremes and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nurses and their families.
For the last two months, we have been holding consultations with the Committee on Junior Medicine and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the revelation of maladministration.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in care – was a sign of the seriousness with which employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug that costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug that costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day, while authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is part of the National Health Service (NHS) and assesses the introduction of new treatments, has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, one-quarter of whom have a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter that accumulates on the walls of blood vessels and produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot, which prevents blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks off, it can travel through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be given at the first 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and an additional dose of aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the NICE says: “While effective treatments are available to effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke, often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have found evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor will increase treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend a longer duration of treatment.
Due to the climate of political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was fired from office last year for corruption, resulting in a government report
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles harshly criticized police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to election fraud “due to their sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
According to Pickles, known as the former Minister of State and the current anti-corruption figure, the religious intimidation of voters was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the electorate only has to give their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes dipping fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He called for better access for journalists to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, be removed from office due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman "deformed" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and subdued his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was quoted as "using as a basis for his campaign the religious duty of every religious Muslim to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast by a person pretending to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern at the post-election fraud reportedly involving high-ranking members of the Muslim community pressuring people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: 'There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, have been pressurised to vote according to the will of senior members, particularly in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.'
"There was concern that . . . state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activities because of their 'politically correct' sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots by political activists in order to prevent "vote harvesting".
Theresa May's report, which is currently under consideration, also calls for more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.
Dipping your fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure voters’ nationality and voting rights.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition for political activists to handle filled-in voices and envelopes.
The police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff supervise the rule that only one person is allowed to enter the ballot box at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Election Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from their position for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without any serious doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded for many reasons."
He also criticised the inefficient "crushing checks" by the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the city council.
"Last year's court ruling in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," said Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and concealed fraud and denial of elections by some.”
The resemblance of an Olympic cyclist to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers rage at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But social media discussions have shown that this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic champions whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is evident.
The hunter and the wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. men’s archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Duchess Catherine’s double on cycling tracks, many people have cited on social media how one archer could be Leonardo DiCaprio’s favorite actor’s twin brother.
U.S. men’s archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm after tweeting pictures of him resembling the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the noise on social media and admitted that he had heard from childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance as big, except perhaps the beard and the moustache," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
The 2012 London Games featured the resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will undoubtedly be highlighted even more in these Games.
The big-eyed and expressive Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison on the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips, has long been quoted.
Silver medallist for swimming, Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, not just for her beautifully tanned skin and blond hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in the shape of their faces and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the pair to look alike.
One tweeter recently said he was delighted that “other people on the Internet agree on the similarity between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter.”
The American football star and Dexter actress really resemble each other strikingly in the shape of their faces and eyes.
Many have also noticed similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and in the wide smiles of the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer is "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth place in the women’s 4 x 200 metres freestyle message shocked CBC’s direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian public broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “lost smells” and “died like a pig” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to shoot his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 metre freestyle message finale.
MacDonald, who was brought into the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
He was too excited, went out fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57:79, lagging 1.61 seconds behind Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to catch China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the commentator’s tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
Ai Yanhan, who slept in the final of the women's 4 x 200 metre freestyle message, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with fierce criticism of Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald’s speech: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
In the end, CBC had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his apologies to the comments of more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The company also issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they were broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night’s broadcast, and also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies and tried to justify his remarks by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said on CBC's Olympics broadcast.
“I was referring to the swimmer’s performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I did not mean anything defamatory in my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, a woman in the middle of a shop dressed in unblocked lingerie shocked customers
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He further exacerbated the situation by evaluating how he looked in his underpants, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually tried four pairs of underwear at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store in Folkestone’s Bouverie Place, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman wore clothes and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underpants off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but he did it completely disgracefully.
Everyone was staring at him as he took off the underwear he had tried and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
She did it three more times before finally deciding she didn’t like them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the look – nor did he think about the person who would eventually buy the panties he had tried.”
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent Town, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone takes home panties that have been worn by someone else and have not been washed.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the shop staff tried to remove those items of clothing from the sale after the woman had left – which is right.
It would be awful to take the new panties home and find that someone else has tried them without having them washed afterwards,” Davidson adds.
Primark’s spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the situation that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, in its Folkestone movement.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market."
How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Attacks with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Association in New York City and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or assaulter swinging a gun in close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker is approaching from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the shooting line, Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant with the knee in the groin, and when he goes out of pain twice, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You have to move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest with your fist. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
World traveler Ian Wright licks some of Europe’s dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and poking reflexes to a severe test by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk presenter and author of travel guides Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking a euro banknote, handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was documented in Ian Wright’s Inner Force, and the results were surprising.
The idea of licking the flush button of a train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused anything but an unpleasant mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and miraculous things.
The licking of railroad handrails and toilet flush buttons undoubtedly challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a child, and I've put all kinds of stuff in my mouth, like soil, worms, and curd water."
In the film, he proved to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The limit was met in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units – the same number for freshly washed hands is less than 60.
In the documentary film Ian Wright – On the Trail of Inner Power, which is produced with Valio, Wright explores how many bacteria are present in different places, including the bathroom.
Wright said, “This is almost the worst smell I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don’t lick anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – On the Trail of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the gut.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snack, Juice and Novelty Products at Valio, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking of something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ia to join us."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Bowel health has become a global trend, and this documentary helps us provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor.”
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain objects we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, some of the objects were easier for Ian to lick, while others were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported using products with added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
The family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
The family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages in a city-owned rental house after being evicted from the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find that the apartment was in renovation condition.
There were gaps in the walls, the floorboards had been torn out, the debris had been spread on the floors and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private home.
Cornwall Housing Officer Donna McEvoy says she fears the apartment may no longer be able to be saved.
He says, “This has been a complete nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to endure this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to become known as a less pleasurable part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, just like its name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the tyranny of the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and trafficking, as well as loud shouts, quarrels and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an order on anti-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
In the past, drugs had been sold in the house, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forced the couple out this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction – they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and it's been hard all that time.
The police have come here an incredible number of times.”
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we weren't used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of forced enforcement at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called regularly.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for their own and family behavior, as eviction is always the last measure the Cornwall Housing Office is considering.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood to watch.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the community members who participated in the work and bravely offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the welfare of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean up the waste piles surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis plus scales and other supplies, plus <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for possession of a class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been told that they have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were covered with graffiti.
Police say they want to evict tenants who violate the rules of the lease.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police says this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who consistently defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they please without charges, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," Crow said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-taking military jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed at an astonishingly low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic images show an army plane approaching sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in northern Portugal’s Aveiro.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet, understandably worried by the noise of the jet engines that began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the survivors who shot the dramatic flight and posted the videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it seemed like it was crashing down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly showed up and flew at an astonishingly low level.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the coastal fishing vessels, which was why the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke from nearby forest fires impaired visibility, but according to the Air Force this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Eksote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million in January-June than planned.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the waiting lists.
The exote covers a surplus of a previously incurred deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Sworn in Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took an oath on Friday.
The military ceremony of the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special border ice hockey course was held on the garrison sports field.
The oath was sworn by 70 soldiers.
Special Frontier Rangers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border ice hockey.
250 of them were invited to the exams.
Specialised border icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The meeting was attended by five wartime border veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the robber - Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had an RTA (Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In total, the unit consists of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
The Chief of Staff is Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costume.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working habits
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the way police work.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that police officers are less likely to go to the place of the swamps until they receive an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with three national units below it and a criminal intelligence unit for each police unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Criminal Police, manages the operations nationwide.
As its name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, an alert task database and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
You can also see your handprint at work, whether it’s honest or criminal.
Based on the method, the author creates a certain kind of image.
Serialisation can be done either by the method or by the person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA do not walk around the city with their collars upright, but their work is not fully public.
The methods used by criminals as well as their own are not reported, as this could lead professional criminals to develop their activities and thus try to prevent police attempts to prevent crime.
The police will publicly announce the methods if they predict that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which vacant dwellings were marked in the early summer.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin, or a piece of tape in the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually travelling.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis team has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
The smartest ones order a report from the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go with the thieves in gloves.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Police of Eastern Finland, Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
Against the backdrop of a decrease in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the own institution and the borders of Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It is reported that one in three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee told the girl’s family that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this serves as a warning example and testament so that people understand that this is a real risk when going to a war zone -- and that will make people give up their decision to leave," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and remained a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland’s appointment to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would nominate Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court judge if he was elected president.
Senate Republican MPs have refused to confirm Garland’s appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to fill the post of deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would elect Garland “with a fairly high degree of certainty.”
Reid’s spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “swing the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Appeals Court in the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who block Garland’s nomination are Donald Trump’s “order villagers” and “helpers.”
He said Trump is not fit for the job.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s-style and Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of the celebrity secret models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity magazine differs from the old school Playboy magazines, saying, “Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
Apparently, he thinks the same thing about the calendar.
“We need to bring back the timeless and classical nudity where women, as well as men, can easily enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
“Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
Those who want to model for the calendar can send their photos online or participate in the open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to comment on your angry objection under the pseudonym Not AllAloneMedium-agedMen, this statement is based on real research data.
According to YouGov, behind the much talked-about new arrival of vinyl records is not the boom of the millennial generation, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the nostalgia of middle-aged.
The age of the person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It’s not just about hobbyists wanting to pick up records, it’s emotional: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walked down the bustling Soho Street, wearing an unjeweled grey jacket. I'd bend my hand lively, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
While Soho has slowly lost its charm and ruggedness as hotels, the Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before privately owned premises, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I look very close to the men who visit these shops and try to gauge their age and character by observing.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (at that time two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably in their twenties) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends his extra time exploring the shops that offer.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000-4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as you can see in the photo. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and to buy back things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I get a lot of late 60s and early 70s stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to have them," she says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new flow of people who have been affected by the media leap. These people have heard about the vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyls,” he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl hernias of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you realize that they provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may amaze some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and reminds of the lucky days of youth.
“I think sometimes it fills a gap or acquires material possessions for some consolation,” says Wez.
"I saw it as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get your mind off.”
"We're like social workers!" exclaims Wez's colleague behind a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The survey also found that 41% of people who buy vinyl records have a turntable that they never use, and 7% of people who buy vinyl records don’t have their own turntable.
At this point in the newscast I would probably show a serious face while browsing stacked bossa nova collections.
The new release of the vinyl albums is also accompanied by a "pokal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe movement (at the time three middle-aged men were customers).
"A customer recently came into the store and said he didn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny said.
"The share of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just beginning to have a hobby.”
The customer base is considerably more varied at Fopp, which I will be arriving next. The store has dedicated an entire layer of vinyl records.
Guests include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is delightful, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous stores: instead of rocking jazz, the loudspeaker sounds with Wild Beasts’ latest synth pop.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a nagging psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes and watched various discs at a discount.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
“They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music on the computer or otherwise, but the exquisiteness of the wine is ...” she lets out a delighted sigh and continues:
“I can’t explain it, it’s so unique.”
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping in jeans, but instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with albums by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, keyboards for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some are so high that they can’t even be reached.
They're pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that any means of getting attention to these records could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population group that is most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl records.
While my research shows that YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work life.
Surely they don’t spend their Thursday mornings chewing at Berwick Street record stores, browsing through records and avoiding a 30-year-old television presenter who stares frightenedly and stares at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri or ice shark is the longest living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark in the study was found to be between 272 and 512 years old.
French court rejects application for dismantling jungle camp
A French court has rejected a request from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a trial held this week, Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell different kinds of goods from tobacco to energy drinks and provide haircuts to the residents of the refugee camp. Temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they present fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as the free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the ever-increasing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary shopkeepers, but considered the concerns of the prefect of Calais "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s grocery stores, cafés and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food to people who “live in extremely unstable conditions.”
They offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids café, a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to the camp’s hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring the children's cafe to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that after a steep increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of more than 9,000.
Food prices in Finland are falling significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is drastically cheaper to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while the average price in the EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen the second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels as in Finland.
Only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is available from Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen’s article, which was published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices tended to close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which the food became cheaper year after year.
Now the price is weighed down by the Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices in agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen substantially.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, which had a similar level of wages to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the control countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the same level as the old EU countries in terms of food prices, we must halve VAT to the average level in the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Mr Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
If you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
This is a rule that applies to all schools in Finland.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the learning of typography will be abandoned, and instead coding will be practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start already in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is a way to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found, ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It could live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is bypassed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, it is only about a centimeter per year, according to observations, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues investigated.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks out of 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the lens' radiocarbon timing.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and the 502-centimeter-long Amazon algae, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the females of the ice shark do not reach sexual maturity until they reach more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they will be about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - sales will not be reduced
Almost 300 employees will be laid off at Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of retailers in department stores will not be reduced in order not to damage customer service.
In addition, around 80 support workers will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann’s co-operative negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for redundancies was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The population reduction aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised during next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
The reason behind this is Stockmann’s difficulty in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store sale is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Chief Executive Officer of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s goals.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second-quarter performance improvement was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and profits.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will contract from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but there are swamps in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north we stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shaken by doping scandal – strange explanation for coach’s rap
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform for is 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi of Kenya's national team said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home for “committing crimes against the Kenyan national team.”
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee president Kip Keino told Reuters.
Athletics for the Olympics begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year and is a pre-winning favourite in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah walked through the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
the Rio Athletics Stadium
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
The fight for medals in athletics began in Rio on Friday, but the world’s top athletes were able to showcase their skills in a confusingly empty stadium.
Rio officials said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day of the morning race and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening race have been sold.
The second was in London four years ago, where the stadium was thrilled with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, the stand was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the audience of 12,000 people was only about 30 percent full.
At least the poor sales figures are explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a destination for European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not reach the full stadium.
Organisers spokesman Mario Andrada said on the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the cost of the tickets was almost half that of Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros for the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio in the morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation with new means.
Established last year, the Foundation acquires the ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem the land for ownership rights.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by those who wish to obtain the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will have a veto on the 187-square-metre parcel, which means that in practice not all holders will have to approve the land if the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for more than one parcel.
Acquiring the right to rule is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to wear banners or tie yourself up somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control his company.
Those who have obtained the right to control their blocks will receive precise location information, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
The website of the Foundation displays the names of the holders of rights on the same map where the parcel data of the land can be found.
The only risk Leviäkangas sees in its nature conservation procurement is that the foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of proprietary rights, but the Foundation has obtained its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on August 13-19.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most in big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and parts thereof were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August this year per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In some cities, the number of thefts doubles in proportion to the population compared to others," police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board describes.
Police are wondering why the city is at the forefront of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The prevalence of robberies can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the Police Board, is expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on which cities are studying and cycling.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the police are aware of slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 bikes a day, and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 bikes a year.
“It’s a lot of stuff,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are resolved.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases are also revealed in other investigations, for example, when stolen bikes can be found in an apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual bike models, Jopo is the most stolen, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not been reported to the police that the stolen bikes are going to go abroad," Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bikes are, according to the police, ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
Buyers of used bicycles must be careful, as they may be guilty of a concealment offence or a concealment offence.
"Alarm bells should ring if a good conditioned bike is sold at a clear price," says Reen.
Specialist Librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says the Deer. "Has never been stolen, has been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so tempting for thieves, it doesn't necessarily have a hipster value either," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to shop at a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike crawled against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks her bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"You hear from friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such scumbags."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve herself from the yard of a housing company a year ago.
But the bike had not been locked, so Valve could expect it to be stolen.
Under 15-year-olds responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki to test peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under 15 years of age, who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the jury will discuss the incident with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator himself can join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are being used in parallel.
“Everyone directs the young person’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t get ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is modeled in the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not have to face an adult panel, but reflects about what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu’s service design agency, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
Peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
The letter is addressed to the president of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channelled into congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that Donald Trump’s disagreements and his recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking disapproval threaten to bring a ballot of votes to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional election can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing every day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress” and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her economic policy on Thursday.
I'm running for president so that the US economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy is going well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure—roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich and partly by private money.
The construction program is a stretch to the American laborers, who are suffering as the factories move to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. to become a tax refugee, it will have to pay outgoing tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by the Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the Republican Donald Trump’s economic program on Monday that it “only favors this kind of millionaire.”
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cuts have previously been called “Trump’s loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the audience of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewer statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a high level of spectators.
At one time, the Games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at its best: on Tuesday night, the Olympics channel TV2 watched 615,000 viewers at the same time.
For comparison, the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been cycling on Sunday evening and gymnastics on the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator numbers and reminds us that the spectators will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of TV viewers who choose the Olympics in general.
On the television side, viewers are also distributed on TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference – most of Rio’s broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for slack interest - if it is considered slack - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first race, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, the spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competition, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the competition.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're about 200,000 now.
"We'll get the network's viewing numbers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked well for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has arrived and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been provided that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be more visible on Yle’s channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the races on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only the most laborious events in Yle’s history, but also the last ones that can only be watched from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be visible on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre depression in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which the dive computer showed a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the finding by sonar scanning.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says Jari Hakala, a development engineer.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are more than 80 metres long.
They haven't been studied as closely as the day.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unfamiliar deeps," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, your Päijänne will not be among the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14:29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax reduction: Pensioners’ tax remains tighter
Taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the misconduct was brought to light during the parliamentary elections and pensioners’ taxation was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The Government's proposal does not contain this.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received deductions that reduced taxation.
The issue was heated up in Parliament by opposition representatives who coalished Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Ecclesiastes), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power rather than increasing it, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s insecurity.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Orpo about their desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It has been done with the help of the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It becomes necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment must be tackled
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget racket, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will evade.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a huge social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known victims of the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night during Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
Finnish trips to Thailand take place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to contact Finns in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was adopted in referendum.
The referendum was not a transparent, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested who protested against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the last 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in tourist-famous Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded during the night in a tourist destination that is also popular with Finns, the holiday island Phuket, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured.
A total of four bombs exploded in Hua Hin yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Author of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling Thai military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
"We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the ambassadors regarding caution, says Westphalen.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish Night.
A little more information has been provided about the attack in Hua Hin last night.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There are at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded every half an hour or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles Wins Women's Quadruple
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman finished second with 60.098 points and the Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for standing championships at the Rio races on landscaping, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the fullest in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and the permanent championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States, Biles has won two World Championships.
The weaker World Cup medals in Biles are jumping and booming.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: “Isku has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be any more miracles,” says Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has witnessed many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If this hasn’t been the case for tourists, it’s not the case either.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and told me not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work as usual in the morning.
They thought roadblocks were put because of the queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the movements on the main street were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had never even heard of the attacks.
At 3:30 a.m. in Thailand, traffic in Patong had normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
This car was later seen in Kroonupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two characterized men hiding in a nearby spruce tree.
The other man was caught immediately.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and aggravated damage.
Police are thanking those who gave the hints.
Director of Research on Russian Leadership Changes: Clear Aside
On Friday, Russia’s highest-ranking leader changed over the years when President Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomatic and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of managerial positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating presidential power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten involved with other leaders or screwed up.
Defeat to Ivanov
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s inner circle, will take on special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for reassignment and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people on the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guards, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s seat that Putin switches to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in Syria retreat
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, but in fact, the civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Prof: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Director of Communications tells STT that there is a noticeable need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's Final Olympic Show Begins in Rio
Just like in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He broke his backbone and was forced to skip the Jamaica Olympics.
This hasn’t been a perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low dressed samba dancers and fan-changing journalists.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has been struggling with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympics came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-metre rounds with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by his injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 meters, breaking the world record and the competition's confidence in a time of 9.69, despite the final celebration.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the culmination of his career.
The world records of 9.58 at 100 metres and 19.19 at 200 metres are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but no one but Bolt himself believes it will happen.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Athens’ 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
At the Beijing World Cup last year, Bolt defeated the American by only one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals, if only he has made it.
In Daegu, Bolt missed the 2011 World Cup final due to a fake start.
Bolt will turn 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the final finish line for next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive anti-doping test at the Olympics in Rio.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to your home for giving a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the 100-metre women's butterfly swim in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case before the International Court of Appeals for Sport.
Xinhua said Xinyi’s sample on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other suspects of doping in Rio.
Bulgarian women’s runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had faked an athlete during the test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is a Kenyan sprint coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre race pass of Ferguson Rotich.
Nothing can stop Phelps - historical gold became a show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200-meter medley squad in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic gold medal in the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps won at 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," said Helen Skelton, a BBC Olympic swimmer, in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get too stressed if there’s a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he says.
Skelton has worn high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough revelation – at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, no rear steps are allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to thrill and maybe even thrill, but he insists he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the riot has reached Finland?
I can’t, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers are doing the job and how big the sacrifices they’re making is okay with me.
You know what, man?
It is an outcry from nothing, if it comes from dressing up.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police on Thursday said they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
In the same connection, police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members had already been arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after they had controlledly detonated the package.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police controlled the package and exploded.
The audience did not reach the spectators by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the lobby.
The police blew up the package and let the public enter the hall only afterwards.
The drink woke up the Spanish team who started the games sleepily.
Spain defeated Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Police were forced to explode a suspicious find near the road cycling destination on Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match in the first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stadiums.
Argentinian lady sucks Petäjä-Sireni – Finn thinks about protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful race day in Rio.
The winds of Petäjä-Siren were very bad on Thursday.
An Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of women’s surfing day.
Winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He was stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away,” said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
It was not necessary to do so, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn was hanging on his board until the end because he didn’t want to get caught in Rio’s dirty water.
The Finn was ranked 27th in his departure due to a collision.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medallist is eighth.
When it comes to the tip, the collision didn't work much.
Friday is an important day when we have a 10-12 race.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Extraordinary Things Science Says Will Extend Your Lifetime
Science has studied everything that exists between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person has no control over can bring him more years.
These include, for example, a tendency to be obese or a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to waste your time – just get a can of milk.
The secret of long life has been investigated in a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially for neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily intakes - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can extend a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the development of other diseases in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found that laughter influenced a person’s life.
The project, which lasted seven years, monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
It will take a few more years, there is no denying that.
However, achieving a long life expectancy does not require unconditional slopingness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bum.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years into his life.
Some scientists suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over the age of 65 found that a person who shops daily was more likely to live as a parent than someone who shops less often.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may prematurely cause death.
So put down your credit card – online shopping doesn’t have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashes into truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskentä, midway between Koskenttie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car had hit the lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained upright in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car crashed into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was stuck in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test score was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post sent candy to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salo’s K-Citymarket’s candy selection, because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are shortcomings in the bulk goods, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
So unless there's traffic on the lawn mowing, the sign says.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is on Posti’s offer until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that this issue raises is unbelievable, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites in a candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for Posti’s Transport Services business, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages wandered into the wrong place (Seinäjoki) yesterday and we did not go to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three of them anymore, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Halti wasn't upset about the sign because she found all her own candy favourites.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 kilos, published a photo of her change
A comedian-producer has lost dozens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and television producer Lotta Backlund started her slimming project in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of pictures of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in her appearance over the years.
Backlund’s before and after photo pair has collected several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard! one glows.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel the same way, someone else tells me.
In the spring Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let's do it now project.
At that time, he told the Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was ten kilograms away at the time.
During the three-month fitness course, I finally lost five pounds.
Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the sake of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nurse training there.
The Veterinary Department remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor, and without fear of work.
My dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
Neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection.
A police dog, Börje, was involved in the tracing of the murderer, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to initiate a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgement, Posti could have withheld only part of the salary of an introductor, which corresponded to the part of the introductory work of the whole day.
According to the district court, an employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Association of the Postal and Logistics Industry Union (PAU)’s organisational decision on the prohibition.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not inspect temporary agency workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (c.) write in a reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Federation of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns about freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration - instead of Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s close inner circle, will move to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin’s statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for reassignment and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many saw Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was elected president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's buy-in banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record-breaker will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United’s Paul Pogba is suspended from the league when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for Pogba to Italian club Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game because Pogba was banned from playing at Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event starring some of the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival guests have typically expressed themselves in a unique way.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which takes place this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind this success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It is quite unusual for people to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal is to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
Increasing the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance the activity in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge channels.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been enlarged, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partly decorated area of artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent for 15,000 people will be used as a venue for gigs this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even large visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "district things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive way.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost by content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 people were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers were foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek has tweeted a powerful picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran to me and told me that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon afterwards, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, also favored by Finns.
As far as I know, no one died.
At the same time, a second double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
The Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are dissatisfied with the actions of the Thai military.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been keenly involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby force will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to fight missions only after several months of taking an oath, Keskisuomalainen says.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Chief of Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the journal, for example, of the conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Training, reserve personnel from the standby force will be assigned first.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hefty fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and in court.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s legal and settlement expenses for a total of EUR 47,344.
The court granted a fair price reduction, as the purchasers had already known some of the repair needs of the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola searched for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the facts mentioned in the health check report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the inadequate management of rainwater and melting water flowing along the bedrock.
However, the discussions did not show that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the cliff might have to be controlled a little within a few years.
The purchases were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
During inspections in 2012 and 2013, microbial growth was detected in the building, which according to witnesses was due to both rocky rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mould or yeast that exceeds the limit values was found in brush samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window and the basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been modified in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, home issues were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major renovations in the near future.
In the opinion of Tola and Waroma, the Court of Appeal had no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Scary archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - register includes Finns
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland have microfilmed records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German racial office.
Heinrich Himmler was the SS leader.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological examinations to clarify the issue.
The Finnish Racial Service investigated the background of women, among other things, by examining church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the family tree of women.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from their loved ones to the National Agency for Racism.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who spoke German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidizing children.
The German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Petäjä-Siren in the sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first start of the Finnjollies’ day at the Rio Olympics, but remained the tail of the whole group at the second start of the day.
The nirkko rose to the eighth place after five sets, but the failure of the second set brought him down to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day's starts at <0x23>17 and <0x23>3.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470th class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd at the start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpään’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours’ sleep: “I was so in a nutshell”
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, the bartender of the cruise ship, became the king of tango in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, is still struggling and is currently on a rampage.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer, was published today.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career rose to a total boom when he won the crown of the Tango King at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, at the request of a man, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so fucked!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn’t immediately guess that the song was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and perfection from yourself.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and the case ended up with the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songwriters ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, it was written based on the news in the 7-day magazine.
The reason for the divorce between Jari and his ex-lover was his excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and it wasn’t true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company furiously and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour of the resignation and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan of former US President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign “It’s the economy, stupid” flew to the trash in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curl language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the explanations for economists for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, i.e. almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a decline in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it will boost the export industry.
In the opinion of the economist, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently demonstrated.
They were particularly harassed by the impartiality of the BBC, which gave as much room to EU-friendly economists representing only 2% of the economists as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what they thought of the consequences of the breakup: IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other economic capital combinations.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not have a common interest.
Academics in big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an Economy
The overwhelming win-win argument for Brexit was immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant congested your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments without them?
In every school there are children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get into school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every city.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to answer them and, if they succeeded, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues in health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are the net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drafting plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of a camp in favour of a withdrawal from the EU, began to be prepared more closely a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they might be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only open daily quoted real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even less.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trade
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors became nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trades for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to withdraw money in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you weren’t forced to withdraw your money now, it wouldn’t be worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He pointed out that there had been no similar upheaval in the Continental European funds in Aberdeen, for example.
But there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closure of real estate funds trades attracted unduly much attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures dominated about four per cent of UK real estate.
The shutdown of Aberdeen lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its funds close to 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been downgraded, but the situation does not seem to be "greater" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down on London’s real estate market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, real estate investment manager at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's a strong word in your head.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was already alive, despite the early hours of the morning.
The television screens, normally set to be silent in the office, resonated with the news, and usually the noisy crowd was completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens were all red.
“It was a morning you never thought you’d live on,” Vanhanen said.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. on Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market predicted drastic declines in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
Office space in London was projected to decline by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the thunder has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been reported.
CBRE’s data on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London’s office buildings accounted for a minus of 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All similar drops occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
This is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen believes that the comparison is not entirely correct, as we are dealing with a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
The repairs could have been done anyway.
In fact, he doesn’t think it’s a miracle that the price correction was going to happen – it could have happened even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimates, real estate prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have risen for four reasons, Vanhanen’s list.
Britain’s economy has grown strongly, London’s population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new assets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, debt leverage has now been used significantly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price rise levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was a turning point, and here it is.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He doesn’t dare to judge the future, but he says there’s hardly any upswing to come.
The mood indicates that there is a declining or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the holes can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much a victim.
If you are decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its loyal customers’ purchases.
When information has been collected so far on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in early May for the purchased products as well.
The S Group is following Kesko here, as the data on the goods purchased with the Plus Card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have forbidden the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group’s registration change.
Kesko categorises its loyal customers in ten groups according to their mere grocery purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information at product or group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know where the purchases were made in the store and on what day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level like K-Group or S-Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is planned to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you about this later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
So far, SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment are recorded.
In addition, the S-Bonus Partners’ information has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, data is recorded at product group level for the time being.
For a long time now, customers have been asking for more targeted marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partners.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
Anyone who is interested can check their stored data on S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - puppy will be the first explosive dog
A black labrador puppy is sniffing five similar boxes in line at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog to play with her favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of scented gunpowder gas shells were revealed.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for online shopping
Heila is Tulli’s first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The other main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs’ duties is postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, including arms and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs at Helsinki Airport has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons components, ammunition and explosives as well as their precursors.
Heila will work in different locations at Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In the future, ports will benefit greatly by being able to go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila are also training with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs decides, together with other authorities, what odors Heila is taught to recognize.
The pendulum is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli’s six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
You can't go anywhere without a Swing at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from the one-time law.
The cameraman in Evening Messages loses the mic cover of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover that looks like a soft toy immediately after the "remove" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, the passengers cannot come to iron the dog wearing the work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a working dog to Customs is approximately 6000-70000 euros per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire in the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are a fierce competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for the ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience with dogs and supervision tasks in Customs.
Mini-State Receives First Olympic Medal - People Have a Day Off
The Olympic gold in rugby in Fiji, which has less than one million inhabitants, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
The Fijian public broadcaster said that the Fijian government confirmed the case once the championship was cleared.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also festivities for the hero team in their home country.
The rugby team of Fiji celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up at the stadium.
Usually only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging," Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times reporter, told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at losing 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening property as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos in push and 145 kilos in drag.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with a fierce shriek.
The body shuddered under the weights until the jury approved the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was that he suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club has signed an end-of-season contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player who has the power to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With over ten player agents, we went through over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when Aleksandr Kokko, the lay king of the previous season, moved to Australia.
The Proud Modern Family Star Reveals Almost Everything: Teenage Star's Shorts Reveal
Ariel Winter, who is familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, once again blinks by showing off her gorgeous body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts, which leave little to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much more courageous one.
The star has posed in very few clothes and taken numerous tattoos in the pictures she posted on social media.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of becoming an adult, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
The founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
"He's learned that the more the exposed surface looks, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood," Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has displeased some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downturn is already that hard,” said a woman on Winter’s Instagram account.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look gorgeous!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glow a young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to entice Japanese people to start their Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the key to our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for northern light trips in Lapland in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts in early autumn and continues until the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairytale, says Anne Lind, Vice Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more distinct unique sights from Finland, and the Northern Lights have enormous potential here, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as they did in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese spend 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby 7 when Fiji's championship team won gold
The UK’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby competition was crushingly interrupted by Fiji’s victory in the final at Deodoro Stadium in Rio on Thursday, with numbers 43–7.
Fiji taught masters in ball handling, moves, side delusions, support game, running lines and brutal force, thus winning gold – if it was the country’s first Olympic medal in all its history.
They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-ever rugby-7 tournament, where the team defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Strictly winning the South African Boxes at 7–5 in the semi-finals earlier in the same day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have beaten the British even if the 15-member team had been in full force.
The fact that at least one Briton will receive a gold medal tomorrow may be a comfort to the UK: Fiji chief coach Ben Ryan, a former Wimbledon-born English rugby-7 coach.
It has been quite an experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all of the games at the Adelaide Sevens in coaching Ryan.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but the progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and showed its tackle skills to the UK for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had hit a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau made a dive at the corner.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the ball.
The situation was 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tackling prevented Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but that didn't slow down Fiji for long.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal at the right corner, after which the United Kingdom lost 17–0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for the continuation, leaving more than a minute to play in the first half.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvourou drifted through the more powerless tackles of the British team and drifted over the goal line.
The opening period ended with 29–0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentices in the sport.
Which is very much true.
The UK made extensive changes in the half and managed to hold the Fijians for a full four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half until Josua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36-7 by scoring a goal for the UK in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea Archipelago, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s purely cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final touch on the Fijian cake by finishing the final moments.
The violin rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won Japan in the semi-finals by 20–5, and the United Kingdom had passed South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where the tie was decided by the United Kingdom's goal-kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and drove under the goal poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England’s 15-player rugby player Anthony Watson, seals the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is the most emotional gold that could be in these races.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed into history with 220 winning bets and found an extra purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two in the oars, the third in the boat was the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles, making them the first women in British sports history to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, winning for them for the 39th time in a row and again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting to the surface of the water like swans age, does not exactly match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the achievements of the two. However, the most important of the helpers is the coach, who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, and who at that time did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be removed.
Without the surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thinking a bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The team was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the sport’s high season in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little inconvenience as possible, if I may say so in circumstances like this.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the duo’s thoughts were with Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "At the emotional level, I've been in ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years, Helen and Robin's cashier's been fantastic.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better coach or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have not been able to match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very busy in the moment.
Helen used to say, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get out of the way.”
“We did a good job, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything amazing.
We weren’t looking for the sky today, we just wanted to do a good rowing and win the race that we did.”
The two of them think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover is celebrating his wedding next month with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.”
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland Replaces Government Ruined by Panama Leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks have already called for in the spring.
The Panama Papers have revealed that many Icelandic politicians have evaded tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the autumn election result.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the ruling party was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest rumors.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the incumbent President, Barack Obama, would be the founder and Democratic candidate of ISIS, Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious and asked for an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink so low become commander-in-chief of the army,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-favoured burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a good manners and a secular swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely expresses religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two extremist-linked men attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screen - Pyykösjärvi blue-green algae dew
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae has been observed on the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and Enterococcus concentrations in the waters of Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae dew detected on Pyykösjärvi’s beach does not make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, whereby blue-green algae mass forms on the surface of the water.
The environmental action monitors the situation with more frequent inspections.
If blue-algae precipitation turns into blue-algae flowering, the bathing area notification board will also be notified separately.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational renewal of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational renewal of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax amendment proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s net capital income.
It is capital income after deduction of all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Forestry starts from this, by making a deduction from the net capital income of forestry, it prevents that it would result in a loss on the capital income of forestry, which would be deductible in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if they did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only to a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit of the tax deduction tied to the profit value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
In VM it is considered that the border guarantees the goal of growing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken away in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hailstorm surprises car drivers in Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rear-end on the Himanga in Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Service, two cars in a row crashed into a ditch, after which the driver in the rear collided with the driver in front.
According to the firefighter Harri Pyyhtiä, who is on duty, the fall into the ditch is suspected of being caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 a few kilometres from Himanga towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings by researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the severity of the cancer increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medications by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos family home murder continues at court, prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another offender
Muhos family home death continues at court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family in Muhos.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of murder was also convicted of seriously endangering traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle as an unauthorised young person.
The judgement of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the defendants and the man who had received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a milder sentenced man be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, a 17-year-old youth killed a man who worked as a child welfare supervisor at a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the director from behind on the living room couch.
The pilot had gotten off his grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state study, both of the convicted were in full understanding at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to flee the family home at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, growing only at the age of 156.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the hawk can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until the age of 156.
The ice shark’s life expectancy is increased by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found the age by radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The eldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or the other could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Up to a third of the country’s total tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump’s proposed corporate tax change was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially through tax relief for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as “revolutionary” when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without it, we would be missing a huge sum of <0x24>1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump is 33.
Inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
Urgently decided environmental standards must be reintroduced and the energy sector should be deregulated.
Barack Obama’s health care reform must be reopened.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The “destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty and from Mexico to a 35% penalty.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch over the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see Trump’s program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early Friday.
The Tsunami of the Past - People's News
The sea is turbulent, but the real tsunami strikes in the middle of Madrid's thunderstorm - a reconciliation with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous directing work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and junk-sided satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin in which I Live (2011), the peaks of a Spanish artist’s career.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the same for the middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the movie.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist will be Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher.
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be regarded as cucumbery, but I would say quite cunningly and literally with a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and the often characteristic blasphemy of Almodóvar films.
It is an evenly played, restrained, and in some places with good music, and a rather sad film, which as such contains elements of elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is preserved, so that it gradually begins to catch the eye as a purely formal thing rather than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are afflicted by illness, death or otherwise only sudden loss, but the surface remains equally cool.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the named person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for the spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the current scene, are not much better than this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly spiritless.
Almodóvar wrote the screenplay based on three short stories by the 2013 Nobel laureate Alice Munro.
The novels have been published in The Fugitive: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, and the result is a somewhat equitable literary filmmaking.
The materials would have been emotionally incomparably more robust in the drama, so big things – especially the guilt that eats away – the theme of the movie deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premieres on 12.8.
The government is trying to beat the election - Kansan News
No further cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns of the core do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in bulk.
There will be no further cuts.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (c.) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (ec.) say under the budget.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
The child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Educational cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why are ministers so eager to insist that they should not be subject to further cuts?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen in the past that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, according to the polls, the ruling party expects the Finns to lose their vote, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new delegates, a large part of which will be paid for influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of about the same size depends on the ability of the Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
The “no new cuts” rhetoric obscures the fact that next year they will be made drastically, and secondly, attempts are being made to soften the pending attack on the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The Government has set the target of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take on 5.9 billion euros of debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own agenda: debt is not breaking or even slowing down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be rolled out at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what will happen will be adopted.
With these measures, indebtedness will not be broken
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be broken, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget press conference prove this irrefutablely:
The forecasts for global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no drawbacks from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has hardly recovered since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent during this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be about six billion euros, which will be covered practically entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the central, coalition and basic Finns’ perception of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipality
Three out of four consider that the organisation of childcare, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also devolve responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management to individual municipalities.
The responsibility of the county, in turn, is most clearly intended for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for mentally handicapped persons.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Drunk driver runs away after chasing police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol into Joensuu on Friday night at half past half past one o’clock.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle driving without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonkajanranta road, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Still after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-legged policeman ran after the fugitive.
A blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious risk to road safety.
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi at Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curve to the left and had fallen sideways into a ditch.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door, together with the personnel of the rescue helicopter and the paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was poured into the road from the fallen truck and sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a 165-centimeter-tall, slender, well-mannered woman with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and hints about the missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre hotline number 0295440513.
Ingredients of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest disasters
The fall of the Parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, the chairman of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last Parafest performer Kalle Salonen performed on the stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
A downflow occurs in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward flow of air.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm bind heat, and thus the decreasing air mass cools and accelerates towards the earth.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, several downturns occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the trajectory of the surge.
The flood hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was a child who was transported to a hospital with minor injuries.
Air Pollution Is Ageing Londoners
According to research, Londoners’ skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The study was published in the Evening Standard.
British skincare company CACI analyzes London’s most toxic air particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of their peers in rural areas.
Fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk their way to work near busy streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, using different masks, but a more practical solution is regular skin cleansing.
The tractor's brakes were broken. He pushed the man in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor brakes broke and the tractor dripped on him.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor pushed him enough to be taken to the central hospital for further examinations, with serious injuries.
The tractor could not drain any further, as it hit the rocks in front.
With new strengths for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Finnish Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from better starting points than in human memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone is definitely better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
The midfielder Fred Musoni starts his second term in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Rwandan national player Nelson is a 205-inch chopper.
Garchet is a passier, while the Brazilian is 198 cents.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys for the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth edition of the competition is now underway in Tampere, only in 2013 was Canada missing out after being better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a national team.
I’m interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth City, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball at the Finnish Championship level.
Played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoji in Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in the 1991-92 season, followed by three seasons in Josba.
While playing, he trained the A-Girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in women's Finnish Championships, accumulating a balance of 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen appointed to the national team
Josban from Joensuu was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen from Eno was chosen to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking in Helsinki, has played six men’s national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team’s standard team with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Suomi shirt at the World Championships last December, was also appointed to the national team.
The head coach of the National Floorball Team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley player Essi Krusu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be settled this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
For three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Kouvola Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Nowadays Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, looks forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at Pessis stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region lit up the spark of the Krusty for sport and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are memories of childhood in my mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at Elimäki NMKY E-girls.
The main thing is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that spin on the ankles, as well as amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were very active - the teammate’s father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice of sports in junior years.
The beach of Kõrälampi has been playing a bite since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM-tournament competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksmäki resident Anniina Parkkinen in the SM-finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked team in the tournament is clear.
Our realistic goal is a medal.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
By the way, the toe shoes are put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Two years ago Koli and her younger brother Valtteri Koli started to work as the continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in handy from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If you want to start something, you have to do it properly and seriously.
In 2013, we started building a yard boat, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project very bravely and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would be fine.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of the Rural Future Magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country announced a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The CPI measured annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (from July 2016 to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, prices of the following consumer goods groups were observed to rise: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), means of transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized for Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, approximately 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unembellished, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, twisted their teeth, and made their cheeks chubby, some reviewers called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts suggest a larger problem the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread on Wednesday, including the online releases The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly deny the anime story.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the images were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the very tasteless Asian caricature being equated with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a “yellowface,” but one that has been taken to degrading extremes.”
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s general audience is made up of young people who are more diverse in ethnicity than their parents’ counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect discreetness even more.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this aren’t going to go unnoticed as they used to,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer on the Medium platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a medium post and telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnicity conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mostly white and purely male management and ended his writing with the hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions like this, or they have colored people as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” said Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its spokesperson, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn’t okay.”
According to a congressional expert group, military officials misrepresented intelligence about ISIS
A congressional panel of experts released a report on Thursday that U.S. Armed Forces officers of the Central Command altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican presidents of the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defence Budgets set up a working group whose interim report describes the “general dissatisfaction” of military intelligence analysts.
The Central Command, or Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence results approved by Centcom’s senior executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism action than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than the analysis of other units of the intelligence community,” the report said in a press release.
“Centcom events are unacceptable — our soldiers suffer when high-level policy makers are presented with false analyses,” said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
“Centcom’s leadership flaws extend to the top level of the organization.”
The report, which covers 10 pages, details the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015, as described and analysed by the Central Command in its analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
While the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration have been falsified, it provides an image of analysts suggesting that Centcom leaders have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were far more positive than what actually happened,” the report said.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military assault to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican MP Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence officers in the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to undermine the threat of ISIS in Iraq.”
The Republicans set up a task force after becoming aware of analysts' suspicions that intelligence information about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, is followed by more detailed results, as the investigations are still ongoing.
In addition, the Ministry of Defense’s Chief Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for evaluating intelligence about ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's senior Democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, violated the morality of analysts, and insufficiently addressed divergent views."
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to “a predetermined or political formal line.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon Chief Inspector, which was initiated as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector-in-chief investigation is ongoing.
However, he says, “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a growing number of claims made by defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year cast doubt on how much confidence President Obama can have in the Central Command and in its honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIS intelligence reflects the discrepancies that emerged over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that President George W. Bush’s administration, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and took little time to reflect on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the ISIS intelligence revolt.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Task Force concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes at the ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not passed on outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The then Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators judged the testimony given to the Senate as too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth duel in women’s field hockey and establishes a position for confrontation with Britain
Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. Women's National Team of Country Hockey on Thursday, when the United States defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keep track of the paints they make."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games and lost zero games in their Olympic tournament, sharing first place in their group with the British, who continued their winning streak with a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which determines which of them will be the first and which will be the second in a group of six teams.
The first-place finisher avoids a long-term confrontation with the tough Dutch team, who won the second group.
Regardless of how Saturday’s game turns out, the Americans have already stirred up their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up at the Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and first grabbed a field hockey stick at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played at Drexel). He joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest national team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make it to the final player list.
After that came the 2012 Games, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
“Our work in London wasn’t what it is now.
We've made a complete reversal."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a knuckle.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1–0 position until the third season, when Bam stepped on the pitch.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the pitch for a long time, twisting into the middle pitch, hitting the ball to the finish line, leading the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth season.
The game was the first in the tournament where Jackie Briggs, the American goalkeeper, managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the Americans had scored one goal in each.
Briggs is now living his season of success.
Same as Bam.
“Our investment is good now,” says Parnham, but how good it is depends on Saturday’s result.
In the middle of the Olympia rush, the trampoline brings zen
Regardless of time and place, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message all the time and everywhere.
It’s as if the Olympic fire itself is a flaming message that passes from the archer to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnast and from the gymnast to the triathlet.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a cafe queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics first timer Dooley charms with a smile and could well be a name on everyone’s lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and appear in cheerful TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic light does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farther from the center, in part in the shade are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the subtle charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Although the United States has participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never reached the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side the medals are taken by Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, the trampoline has the charm of an underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I’m not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The genres have their comic potential, which has been used in the cartoon movies for the endless bouncing scenes of the characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the sports that are essentially combined in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolin, which means "sprintboard".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that throws them up to almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements, such as spirals, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty level and "flying time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, the medalheads must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or the start wall, they also have another goal they aspire to in the television reportage, namely the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to bring the spectator to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just to watch the games.
This trampoline offers a breath break.
On the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless as an astronaut, falls down and bounces back up effortlessly.
Of course, the sport also has a competitive aspect, and it’s not easy either, but it doesn’t involve a fierce rushing to the finish line or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as the Olympics can get.
The women’s qualifying games and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and the men’s matching games will take place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will be broadcasting the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the middle of the Olympiamania brings a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be missed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes to watch and objectifying them – as male gymnasts in the United States recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his breathtaking new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly dispersed demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests, which are spreading to ever wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Videos of demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces are striking young people who are forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN chief human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and taking it forward is even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the international crisis team for the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West has contributed to its stability.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in their fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, where few African countries, if any, receive this much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, with the capital city of Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from a model country for democracy: the repressive policies of the government have been constantly reported by human rights organisations, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are being quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to protest, they will erupt out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
“All the youth are protesting.
An entire generation is protesting.”
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to government coalition strangulation over power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are escalating on the Eritrean border, where the escalated situation claimed hundreds of lives in the June battle.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only in the last couple of years that Ethiopians were able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many still access the Internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to the demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest population groups, the Oromah and the Amhara.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharic people of Ethiopia, mostly from the Christian highlands, have long dominated the country’s politics and business and exploited the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that too is changing.
“The collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have taken place in the Oromo and Amharic regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population, but still controls the army, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between the opposites.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," said conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has stepped into Meles’ boots almost indiscriminately.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces controlled by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, were first screwed up and then stolen by the government.
Many protesters were killed in the post-election unrest, though fewer than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their forward-thinking infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment towards the Ethiopian government has clearly not been prevented from intensifying.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amharic city of Gondar, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and hate speech against tigers is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighbouring Somalia, but the base has recently been shut down, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance," Abdi said.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull back his words in a recent campaign controversy by claiming he was not serious when he repeatedly claimed this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican side of the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in an awkward situation, having to try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election meeting on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Earlier Friday morning, Trump tweeted that his allegations were sarcasm.
Trump tweeted his speech the day before when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio presenter and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down on his claim.
The most recent criticism storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support numbers declined.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the issue.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself against sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to be urging the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and withdraws his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that will echo his supporters. He’ll look at how the supporters react to the messages, and then “clarify” in one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different screens."
Instead of softening his statements to the electorate, Trump has changed his style in recent days even more acutely as his support continues to decline.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist found that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is tightly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more closely watched in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his statements to be justified, political speech," Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called a ‘lower-series team,’ and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it failed to deal with the situation resolutely in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of twisting his speeches and discriminating attitudes towards him.
He mocked the "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they can't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation, saying it only shows more clearly that he is not suitable for president.
Café closed due to excessive rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a messed-up café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals find this loss of a coffee shop that has escaped the middle class lamentable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB club is no more, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
Even though New York is no longer the same, a new city is being created.
Last November Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a kilometre north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said that he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
Added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches are available, with capers and browned onion rings to fill.
The list also includes dark grasshoppers.
The coffee shop no longer offers beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months in a cafe, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers began to visit the Verb in a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently went to a cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb coffee and culture," she says.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though that Sunday she took a chai tea blend instead of her usual iced coffee, which is also on the list.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I walked into the cafe every day at 7:15 a.m., like a machine, and there they were already preparing my butter bagels with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders her standard products, but occasionally she varies her bagels from bacon, egg and cheese stuffing.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge that the soap shop took over the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap made with Verb’s own cold-brewed coffee.
"We'll be able to take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with pleasure.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee in the café.
The café can also be expanded to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites from the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like arriving home, says Whitt.
I missed the smell of coffee.
The Great Depression in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary, was fascinated by the luxurious cuisine of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver barbecue and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: devil’s eggs in tomato sauce, potato jam and dessert with plum pudding.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with the people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaboration is Harper’s A Square Meal, which will be released on Tuesday, describing the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper, opened the same year as the Great Stock Market Crash, in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich, while Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it fits very well in the discussion about eating during the Great Depression.
"The worries were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut bread, liver bread and bean bread.
They were made of materials that were cheap and abundant.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they’re enough for a full meal.”
Andrew Coe is smiling.
"It must have pressed on your stomach like lead," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, operated on the buffet principle of “eat as much as you want”.
Women prepared food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of how the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became the central and distressing topic of conversation for Americans," Coe says, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as stews and stews became the main diet, and stews were called "a great way to utilize food residues" because cooks could cover the less attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been at the heart of an American meal, became a luxury used sparingly.
We tried strange mixtures where the most important thing was the fulfillment of caloric and nutritional values rather than the taste or even the common sense of the kitchen.
While conducting research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman made oven onions filled with peanut butter used as a dish in times of scarcity.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe,
Ziegelman adds: “It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onions don't go together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to become careful budget keepers and to meet the challenge of turning carrot-creampague into a tasty dish.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the accounts of the government’s reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “let me eat a cake” attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on a farm in Iowa, he himself ate like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste, the food served at the White House was not only the dullest in Washington, but also the worst-prepared.
Many of the depression foods were abandoned as soon as the land recovered.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is reflected in the way we pay attention to calories and nutrition, and how science has been applied to cooking.
When the couple wrote the book, they began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, including why she couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even started to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one of the wind hats."
After the main dish was emptied at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe picked up the plum dessert they had prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly immersed our spoon in a thick brown mushroom.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe snapped a second and a third.
"German nuts would do this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead Full Compensation for Lawyer Fees for Hepatitis C Drug Patent Dispute with Merck
A judge at the U.S. Regional Court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full reimbursement of lawyer’s fees incurred in a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of <0x24>200 million in damages for violating two of Merck's patents on Gilead's success drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. A US judge found that Merck had committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit registered on Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to an exemption from lawyer’s fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed the private ownership of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s pharmaceuticals.
U.S.-backed forces have taken Manbij city from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have seized the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, in northern Syria, after the last extremist militants left the city, a spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now raiding the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages abducted by ISIS fighters had been released.
"We now have the city in full possession, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
Clintons earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax return, stating that her and her husband’s income at the time was <0x24>10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she had earned <0x24>3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book dealing with her term at the State Department.
Clinton's Vice Presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton, announced their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to always disclose their tax records, even if they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his attorneys have appealed to the tax administration for an audit, saying it’s the reason Trump hasn’t released his income records.
"The transfer is yours," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has tackled this issue and posted a video online on Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release their tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades and does not publish his tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has advocated a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than <0x24>1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election ceremony in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway, a multi-purpose corporation located in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet says he too has been subjected to a tax audit and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual compound tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income was on salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons announced the sum of dividend and interest income of <0x24>109,000.

Chili powdered lightning condoms to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation —the elephants being bullied by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in northern Tanzania villages how to protect their homes and farms without harming the elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to stir up elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on being able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, an intrusive elephant is disturbed by pointing a flashlight and sounding a horn.
If this doesn't work, throw a chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in the condom together with the lighter, after which the condom’s head is twisted so that only the ignition thread remains on the outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last option is a thrower, which shoots a firework known as a Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arabs’ “call” – RT News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots gave birth to a media crack after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the Israeli area code in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel via a separate call center.
The filmmaker asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was a “decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli area code."
In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the incident as a “great disgrace.”
“It shocks and shocks all of us.
It's such a shame.
And it is all the more disgraceful when we consider that we are in Germany and that this is the hotel chain.
That's all you need to explain.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” said the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the Internet, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply succumbing to alleged demands from Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to remove Israel from the area code list was never given," a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement attempted to dismantle the student body, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration and wanted to express their dismay at the government’s plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed an austerity measure that will close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters were doing graffiti on the walls, temporarily opposing Michel Temer, the president.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after streets filled with protesters in support of the dismissed President Dilma Rousseff, with the Senate voting on the impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
Russia’s interest in doing business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
“Russian companies will continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the top priorities for cooperation between countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, rising to USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, the Russian mission to Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in terms of tourist numbers whose citizens visited Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scottish Callum Skinner wins cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner made his name in the men's sprint at the Rio velodrome last night, when the British trio defended the 2012 championship in London.
Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud as he raced to the finish line and won a victory over the favorite New Zealand team.
The UK won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after only finishing sixth at the World Circuit Cycling Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the first lead role.
Hindes came out just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom the British coaches believed and in whom they saw the potential that he has now claimed.
With Hindes, Hoy, who won the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won a gold medal in a duel.
Hindes was shortly behind after his lap, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner maintained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace at a larger gear, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed as a BBC commentator and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says: “I am flattered by the comparison.
I’m just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track deliberately due to a bad start.
He later retracted his words, and the British rivals had no means of appeal.
This time there were no such problems with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the audience.
Our team has been united over the past three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of the progress made in the last five months, then there are five days ahead of us with a successful velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his talents, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean accumulating six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on March 23 (a magical date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as those of Hoyla.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and will be resolved in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says: “At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, “If he wins two more gold medals, he must be given the knight’s title.”
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man teambacks.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won a gold medal, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 10:42 p.m.) will take place today on the second day of the race, and Wiggins will surely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officials before the qualifying race, when the officials invited him to measure his length.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavi reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now rely on its powerful track cycling team to take over the mid-stage of the Olympics and bring a host of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of full leadership in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of allegations of sexism and bullying, and the ending of the competitive careers of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the races on the velodrome on the first night show that Britain’s already legendary reputation for rising to the top at the perfect moment is once again realised.
The future of the Portland smelter is at stake as electricity contract expires
The future of the aluminum smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelter announced that one of its owners was about to terminate the supply contract and that it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to continue subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed, 20-year-old aid will expire in November.
Alcoa’s Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs could be at risk as a result of these redundancies.
The snowball effect may increase further as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Point Henry smelter, which forced the Anglesea power plant to shut down last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the factory, first due to the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, to the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelters to terminate their contracts.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, which is owned by the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
According to AGL, the contracts are so-called hedging contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for the contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
Potential revenue effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts by <0x24>187 million in its accounts as a “foresight” for the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa ... to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November of this year, although it still has to figure out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the poor financial situation of the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates, both of the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and of the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
That would not be good news for us as a producer,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians-reality star Kendall as the September Vogue cover girl
A model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and appeared at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover photo was followed by a strange (or maybe just the Kardashian series style?) scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar disruptors Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) designing a surprise for their sister, pretending to have forgotten their sister's cover photo.
The plot is a cliché and is used in almost all the birthday episodes of the shows (Seacrest utters the words: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to somehow get the other daughters involved in this publicity.
For appearing in the September issue of Vogue will undoubtedly mark a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister, Kim, may have made it to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own class.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling release of the year.
A number that is more similar to a large photo book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year’s 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The announcement of the cover star of the September issue is expected so much that the photos of the magazine have leaked to the public in the previous two years even before the official announcement.
Previously, the September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrities working as models on the cover than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine portrays Jenner as a success model for her generation, and even if she would rather be one of the celebrities working as a model, she is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
You can rightly call them talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry above others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has had one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Due to her reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "bitches".
These feelings have come to the surface again when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the persistence of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres reject 160,000 people every year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable people are being disqualified from the Legal Aid Centres, and the sector is preparing itself for the impact that additional cuts in funding will have on centres already operating at the extremes.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are already banned — most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and people fighting against similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
According to James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, the most recent report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows that thousands of people are expelled from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are consistently underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they seek the essential services they need," says Farrell.
“People leaving violent relationships, people under uncontrolled and crippling debt, divorced families, unduly redundant workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to put an end to these financial cuts immediately, so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring the funding of legal aid to the national average level.
Now is the time to address the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Board of Directors of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's Campaign Sued for Threatening an Employee with a Gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for presumably not taking any action after his leadership was informed that a campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while driving a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized, according to his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini said in his complaint that campaign leader Earl Phillip “put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the barrel on Vincent’s kneecap.”
After submitting a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in a statement.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked public rage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that “proponents of the Second Amendment” – which is considered to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts – could take action if her opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the election and was allowed to elect judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media disconnected his words from the context and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
In his lawsuit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for indifference to the leadership and compensation from Phillip for assault, assault and the emotional suffering caused by them.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking her to comment.
Despite his efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to Phillip’s consultancy company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revitalizes the economy and creates prosperity – not just in local communities and in London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was one of the things that I was most interested in in Heathrow, and like the 2012 Olympics in London, we invested enormously in making sure that our entire nation and all our regions would benefit from them.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We’re doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, thus eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will always be people who think the Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I am told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
This expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment not only to the airport environment but also to the whole of the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and budget, including a T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and a T2 terminal built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, backed by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
The time has come for us to use the same Olympic spirit in the Heathrow expansion to guarantee the future of our trade and to create know-how and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board of Directors and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocking in cat-and-mouse game
The efforts of companies making money from online advertising to mislead ad blocker software have turned into a cat-and-mouse game, says one company that produces blocker software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update the filters of their blocker software and thus block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad tags on its desktop site to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock has unlocked the new code.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of ballading between the open-source ad blocker community and distractors has been going on since the ad blocker was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertising blockers have become for the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook has 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad blocker programs in its desktop application, as the spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers do not work in Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it was updating its user preferences ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also blocked some common Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Adblocking programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that’s why we’ve invested instead in developing user settings like ad tools so people can control their ad targeting.”
Woman commits suicide by hitting cars on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call for eyewitness assistance in the first hours of Thursday's highway accident, in which the woman was deliberately hit by several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman committed a desperate act by lying on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who clearly wanted to commit suicide, including a truck.
A woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses to report.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter told the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, a logical step in such a situation.
It remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Was the collision impossible to avoid?
The prosecutor will have to find out,” Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, according to the newspaper, the person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that drivers cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted on charges of death for colliding with a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court ruled that the police – who were responding to the emergency call – had a justified driving pattern and that the man lying on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation.”
Anyone with knowledge of the incident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Has Been Viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study the past of Venus using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to find out whether the conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous on the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous scientists' presentations, Venus' slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin, Earth-equivalent atmosphere and has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
"In GISS modelling, Venus rotates slowly and has a solar half-day of almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than Earth’s current temperatures.
The model was used to create a Venus story that reflects planetary scientists' earlier assumptions about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
When hydrogen karates into space, all that remains is a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect —that is, Venus as it is today.
The results of the new Venus climate modeling were published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of the club’s ice hockey operations, citing a lack of influence on the team’s decision-making.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately begin to seek a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been in charge of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of hockey with vigor, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
"During the summer I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice president of the club’s ice hockey operations must be in complete agreement with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013 thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made it to the re-season in the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39–39–4 points in the 2015–16 season and was five points away from the Minnesota Wild when playing for the second Wild Card at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers begin negotiations and suspend strike
The chief negotiators say the North Sea oil workers’ wage strikes will be interrupted as all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been carried out against Wood Group, an oilfield service company, on drilling rigs in the North Sea, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, “Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute.”
From the beginning of next week, we will hold a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will deal with the problems on fresh points.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group will cut tariffs for its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of land-based contractors in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the room for manoeuvre needed to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to quit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, in an effort to streamline its operations after its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting energy companies under pressure.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few," Anderson said.
Under <0x24>1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to around <0x24>7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian cluster to date.
Based on the new data, astronomers will be able to find out why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are related to the planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s weight and age, and even its solar system history,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching adulthood.
They are now running faster than ever.
At the peak of rotation, large amounts of star wind are ejected from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (which correspond to sun spots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – the bigger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadian 'dance' that slow rotations are typically larger, while the fastest rotations are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars in relation to rotational velocities.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides a backbone for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down and stop their “dance.”
Rebull and colleagues present their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will be published in the Astronomical Journal shortly.
