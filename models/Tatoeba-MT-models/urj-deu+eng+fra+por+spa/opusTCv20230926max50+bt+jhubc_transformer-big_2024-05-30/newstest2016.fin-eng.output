A 9-year-old boy was found in Tampere.
Police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy’s escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance report of a boy who left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted and there is no risk to his life or health.
The boy's father told Sanomat at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start a follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo once again smashed his goal to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal was at least for a moment a win for the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved to the top of all-time goalscorer rankings after shooting a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk's net with two penalty shots and one match.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona’s Messi, who was in straight sets with him before Tuesday, scored 77 goals.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League Group D it began strongly with a 2-1 guest win over Manchester City.
The winner was Alvaro Morata from Juventus just ten minutes before the end.
The attack was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the Premier League this weekend, only made it to the pitch in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also had a hard time with PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old defenseman Luke Shaw had only a quarter of an hour to play.
Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide hit the ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay in the grass of Eindhoven’s home stadium for about a dozen minutes before medical staff went to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU’s delight lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out with extra time before the break.
Luciano Narsingh scored the PSV in the second half.
In the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain started Group A.
It was Argentinean Angel Di Maria who changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and pulled the ball into the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is among the most successful of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible comparison.
PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, the Moscow CsSKA, lost in a group B match to Wolfsburg, Germany, 0-1.
Opposition Party Calls for Immediate Resignation: President Makes Wrong Speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has repeated the same speech he gave in the parliament at the end of last month.
In his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech was and is about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria to hold special summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who chairs the summit, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more efficiently.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits to shooting girlfriend during emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a schoolteacher, tells the police during an emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that her "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said the contact details of the dead woman's close relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the side of the booklet: "I'm so sorry to wish I could cancel this lovely Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," the letter said.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed the supposed history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told reporters heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the wolf.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after the school shooting forced students and staff to hide behind locked doors.
Scientists on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but who may have had problems.
The students said they had been waiting for his classes.
Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, police say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, “as if something had gone wrong.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told me he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and an associate professorship.
William LaForge, the university’s principal, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled the campus, the police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi, Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents’ house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed her doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were melted wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there was no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house by the river in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together in a few shows.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a variety of online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were joking and throwing jerks at each other.
They were both quite clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminary program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school’s English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night, a candlestick event was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a mass during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press author Emily Wagster from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected because the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers during the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many workers for the holiday season as last year, but a toy and baby product dealer says existing permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
While the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores as well as sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
Back to the Future was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The movie starts and it reminds me that I'm just a fake-knee and a stretch of my hand away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back in the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The Return to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever.”
Back in Time will be available as a video on demand, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
U.N. chief says Syria will not be resolved by armed forces
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increasing military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “will not be resolved by arms” and that additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations for a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the occasion of the General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division between the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "had made the situation impossible to resolve."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and unity they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Support Survey Results That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to stigmatize him as a breeze.
Others think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In ten of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been in the lead in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means for the real estate king’s nomination prospects.
The election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s persistence and have begun using his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a complete reversal.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive view of the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans are currently in favour of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac University in Iowa, 60 percent of Republicans said they had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of the “enthusiasts” vs. 40% of Trump).
The next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio was only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be “dissatisfied” or “shocked” if Jeb Bush, the power’s favorite, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican voters at the national level think that the real estate king has a character that suits the president.
According to a Quinnipiac survey last week, the figure for the first party meeting in the state of Iowa is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the character to be a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post survey, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten say his character does not belong in the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four in ten viewed Trump as the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favor of Jeb Bush.
Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
During the last parliamentary term at this time, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were in favor of another candidate, Trump would still beat almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as anti-Trump support is divided among many other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump will gain majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were confronted, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a big 18-point difference.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters have decided who their vote goes to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with any certainty that they will never change their mind.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
Anyway, Trump’s biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who said they had made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign launch speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s pomp drives Latin voters further away from the Republican Party and harms rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of the matter, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in a Monday’s ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “unsatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet David Cameron for the first time during Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for “less theatre and more facts” for this weekly show.
He also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn’s leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual union meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silent during the national anthem at Tuesday’s memorial service on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain has sparked criticism among Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page articles.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "stands in a respectful silence" and that he "recognizes the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn’s shadow government, told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite his belief that the royal family should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to take part in Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and initially had less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supporting him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant said that differences in policy regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "crowded up" within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a trade union meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government’s secretary for work and pensions, Smith, noted that the party was “very clear” in terms of only opposing the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade of his career as Conservative leader.
The Labour leader has pledged a new approach to politics and now reports that he has “crowded” ideas into questions for the prime minister and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MEP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister’s questioning sessions are too conflicting in nature and that he will refrain from both clever words and snitching, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government’s finance secretary, will be deputizing for her during questioning hours when Corbyn is not present – for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at some point, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre that is often associated with the prime minister's questioning hours, but later he was forced to admit his failure.
Since they began broadcasting in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of the leader's judgement, his control over the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, even though critics have criticised Question Hours as having become a far-reaching caricature that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained to become photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of pound sterling rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the figures showed a rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidder SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of price increases.
The pound rose by more than 1% to <0x24>1,5505, and by 0.84% to <0x24>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49% increase to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 % after its competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s stock rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news came from the competing luxury group Richmont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is Burberry’s key market, had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining giant announced it had raised <0x24>2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s shares were among the largest indices down 4.3% since Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation for the company to “sell.”
JD Sports rose by 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its six-month pre-tax profit: an increase of 83 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Harm Expansion
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees in the UK is raised, it could mean “an increase in the purchasing power of potential consumers.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill says.
The costs could be on the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before Aldi’s <0x24>700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food vendors and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo's are offering tastings in IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol, and hardware wholesaler hosts the annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of Metcash’s IGA stores, with higher margins than the Metcash Eastern State IGA network.
South and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously secular, and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west, compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will seize around 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA retailers could lose <0x24>360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating revenues of <0x24>500 and <0x24>600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash’s high fixed expense base could cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food and food sales to decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, with its market share decreasing from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of Metcash's board of directors would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and the profits from Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
The wholesaler, however, stands by and has invested over <0x24>150 million annually in lowering the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers rebuild stores by adding more fast-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and upgrading stores have added to the attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation Chairman Steve Healy Supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for her behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm raging around his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves more credit than criticism for his own behavior, said Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", was unwittingly made public about the incident where Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis' unwavering defender.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing for second place with Sam Groth in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I'm pretty sure Thanasi has just been dragged into the fight," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost a cramp at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his bat when he’s frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and in my opinion he should be judged by his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberraan to the team's standings.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he’s growing up in public, and he’s made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he’s received. But we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it’s best for both the team and for him to spend some time out of the public thinking about those consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
At the border, chaos followed as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who have fled the violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and set up a roadblock indefinitely between the checkpoints of the two countries.
However, frustration increased.
While the police helicopter was staying above them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary as more and more migrants were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"[Serbia] wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the coming days with other countries and with Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary does not expect its neighbours or Brussels to act in the near future.
The emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be shut down and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the Serbian border has been completed, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are on the run from war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
Let us be very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected next week, but the journalists of the Associated Press at the border have seen for days heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s homeland security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said the authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already crossed the border.
They survived by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are charged with violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a barbed wire-covered train wagon to close one of these points.
The main border crossing point near Roszkea in Hungary was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds tried to penetrate inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership of Bernie Sanders has shrunk by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two-digit Democratic nominations, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pushing for her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democrats (reduced from 58%) and Sanders second by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of Democrats say that it is too early to say that they have decided for whom to vote.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand more firmly behind their own choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined among several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
Her popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s lead among Democrats under the age of 50 has been lost, and she is now on the same footing as Sanders.
Clinton clearly leads the electorate.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit figure among the liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
Almost half of the Democratic voters in the country say they will enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says he supports her with some reservations, and 15% would support her just because she is a candidate.
6% would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35%) say the same about Republican No. 1 Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she had appropriate experience (16%). Since then, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and that she is the best candidate (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is influenced by a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the race – even though a third disagrees.
When asked by Democrats who they would appoint as the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will increase. If Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he withdraws, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden is far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most electable has increased.
When asked what was most important to a candidate, however, Democrats put their opinions before voting.
Last month, too, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among the electorate of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden is the best at being honest, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all these factors, about a quarter of Democrats say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server while she was secretary of state still raises questions, the majority of Democrats are satisfied with her explanation of the issue and say it did not affect their public opinion about her.
But it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People’s opinions were divided in March, shortly after the matter came to light.
A majority of Americans say email polemics did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton’s own party voters consider her to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32% consider her to be honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson, and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many people have no opinion about him, just as they do not have an opinion about Carson.
The margin of error in a survey involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates collected half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23% to 27% in the last CBS poll published on Tuesday before last month’s Fox News poll.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is outstripping Trump among highly educated Republican voters.
With the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, the rest of the field has been left behind. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has declined the most, from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are third in 6%.
The margin of error in this latest poll of 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6%.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed that Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s popularity rising last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First Year Student at Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died at a fraternity ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership rites in September 2013, and subsequently delayed his hospitalization, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
Authorities say Deng was blindfolded and loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head was hurting, and then he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members did not call the emergency number when Deng fainted, but, according to accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood’s national chairman, Andy Meng, to ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual outfits and, therefore, practically put the welfare of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dull object on the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered fraternal amputation, with at least one student per year dying as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County has advocated that the first five members will be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent bullying and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to hold individuals accountable, and if there is an organisation behind the incident that officially or unofficially approved the situation, then they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood disconnected from the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise, and the upward market will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not help much in terms of timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has only lasted 11 months since the first withdrawal, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, but not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial assets.
That is why Federal Reserve officials have insisted so vigorously that investors should not focus on that because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the trajectory of the normalisation of the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, market participants will be able to see that all the fuss about the increase in interest rates has been over-dimensioned.
"The first rise in the Central Bank after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief financial expert on global affairs at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no impact.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that returns on capital tend to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has tended to be strong, with an approximate 14% increase approaching the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly stable (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, a leading capitalist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barre.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the upward cycle, when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate increases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is faced with certain challenges that have not existed in the past and that can spur a recession.
This is particularly the case for GDP, which will be closest to its all-time lowest level before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been less than 4.5% only twice.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will stand, with the third quarter progressing by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economic context can be risky and raise the question of “is this time different?”
Market participants have prepared for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is looking forward to this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the Committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading only predicts a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all upward cycles have so far occurred in increasing leverage supercycles, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has by far been waiting the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already the 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been unstable while the market awaits interest rate increases, and the model somewhat resembles observations of capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its course, its effects will be more visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the upward cycle, bond yields will fall immediately," Deutsche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a convergence of longer- and short-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's fixed-yield analyst in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the dollar’s strength and falling inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the markets have adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies that are predominantly based in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a high level of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have finances.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report.
After the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases, firms with a strong turnover surpassed firms with a weak turnover by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility shares performed better than companies of lower quality, with averages of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with a lot of floating rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the dollar’s value.
Savings can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of “popularizing”
He argues that it is becoming more and more difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying it was not original.
BBC Radio 3 is “becoming” Classic FM, the leading MP claims, increasing the pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station seemed to “recognize” its content and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitors.
“It seems that Radio 3 – I don’t want to use the term ‘people’s awareness’ – is becoming Classic FM,” he said.
He also took on the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be the Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC CEO denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and the provision of information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-rate.
"In addition, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and subscribing to new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey argued that the channel would have to work harder than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and it is in no way distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, with star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to “find success inside their own house” the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of upcoming seasons of The Voice, or order that the money of the licensors be spent on other forms of entertainment.
Online sales increased the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales grew by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest increase since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November’s Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of the UK’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of a flattening of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption in August grew the least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a flattening of online sales, while the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales index editor, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is flattened, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon has been seen as one of the causes of slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will restrain shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to catch shops, crashing the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to quarrel about findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping streets.
Muslims Bury Dead in Mecca Crane Accident, Consequences for Bin Laden Family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies across streets during first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for collapse
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
The 29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the holy place, where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of a mosque and overthrew worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the king of Saudi Arabia found Bin Laden’s family building group guilty of the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
29 of the worshipers killed by a crane in the Great Mosque of Mecca were carried across the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram Bolton, from the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already sworn that the hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's executives were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives have not been apprehended for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Great Mosque of Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, which are part of a huge building robbery led by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions of people arrive in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and those permanently injured.
The injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent of the city for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled workers from Eastern Europe to do home repairs
It seems that if you're good with a hammer or paint walls, you're in the minority nowadays.
The British are hiring more and more assistants to do do-it-yourself work in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a home improvement store chain, said the popularity was driven by the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mockery price.
Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix shops for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wanted more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by the most beautiful sex.
Nowadays, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households that do more home renovation work than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women leading one of the UK’s most important companies in the FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team to equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% women in the group, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, “This was a conscious decision – diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher reported a decline in both half-year profits and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees’ central organizations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread protest of workers.
A lot of people think that reason is also there.
Ask yourself if it’s good to go on strike when it’s going badly.
There was even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration and are going to work.
In the good old days, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring yourself a rich man would have been a political suicide of a small man.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unionists with millions of members is not a big deal, but it gives reason to think.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the trade union movement, the brutal solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the rights of employees, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever you think about the actions of the organisations, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
These things should force everyone’s mind.
University of Lappeenranta: 8.5 million savings, staff cut by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings course, the aim of which is to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operative negotiations on all personnel, with the annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means around 130 redundancies.
Another <0x24>2 million will be saved from other activities.
The JTI negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which forecasts an operating deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government’s budget cuts.
For this financial year, the University will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The University’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of the massive cuts in teaching and research and the decrease in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli of the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding is reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will start on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants to go to the Finnish railways
British owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail network.
Stagecoach is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, says Souter.
Rail transport should be gradually opened up to competition.
The first will be local traffic in the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After commuter transport, long-distance transport is on the way.
Mr Souter said he had already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
The Federal Reserve has to decide on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching the Federal Reserve meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not resolved yet and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event because it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has functioned relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the markets that they need to be ready to withdraw, but the signs also indicate that they believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves a message of apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was "sorry" about the first murder and "hoped that it could be reversed," authorities said on Tuesday.
The Mississippi Gautier Police Department reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, Lamb, called the emergency number at about ten o'clock in the morning.
On Monday, he said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “doesn’t bother anyone,” but is probably upset.
The policeman asked the caller his name, but he didn't say it.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note written by 45-year-old Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday while surrounded by police.
William LaForge, the university’s principal, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite the allegations published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was “no information or evidence” of any kind of “trilogy.”
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "shocked."
O'Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were "by and large best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss was working online from home, and according to Sun Herald, he was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that “he’s not going to jail.”
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb graduated from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a CV on the University’s website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001, she suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 her longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
He also reportedly had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender is in tears and has been out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, and then he'll be cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, he's coming to Manchester United at the age of 18, he's in trouble, and then he's playing brilliantly, and this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Mr Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged tackle.
Shaw tweeted, “Thank you all for your messages, words aren’t enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I’ll come back stronger.”
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, “It’s a really bad injury.”
If a player gets kicked out because of an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when he played for the Mexican team Van Gaal against the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this seriously because it's not about hurting the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn’t see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke tackle it.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
Andres Guardado was also taken to the hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, don't he?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before he or she almost learns it from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ book, The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps company’s website, and continues: “Funny, moving, creative, and with a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book for my children because it always seems like there’s a picture or a message that we’ve never seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to the rather short original text.
"In the city of Tarvelle, within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win over the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, died in 1991, did not write.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from the Lorax film's summary on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In Tarvelle, a city within walls where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win his dream Audrey girl's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, nameless boy hears that the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, tree-cutting and need-woven Kerskanen, ignoring the story of the short, moustached creature Lorax, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text may have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being excluded from the English team, but it was still a tough one.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think there’s a chance of a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but there are good spinners and the team’s mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali evolves in his twisted passes and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth is relegated from England’s cricket team to be replaced by Alex Hales
“The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult for me to analyze because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their scores.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choicers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, there'll be a second chance.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when she wasn’t performing as well as she could, and that doesn’t surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was allowed to play both at home and abroad.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a beater that I appreciate.
He has something as a cricket player that we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but of course this depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen at the kick-off next to Cook has been bullied, so we could get an extra pitcher on the pitch but keep four fast ones, and I'm not against that.
I don’t understand why the batter couldn’t hit there, and this left-handed has already proven to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is the third for them, and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first lattice before moving to the opening in 2001.
He scored 300 points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a reserve quarterback, and, from the little I've dealt with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats -- hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 -- and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers on offer, and the voters picked the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
Appointing Sri Lankan beater Mahale Jayawardene as a consultant for games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing both energy and a ruthless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to play international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of exploitable intellect as Mahale.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly’s teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in the one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and picks don’t make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Brexit advocates of Britain’s exit from the EU could win out if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted re-negotiating strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting into more and more trouble every day, even without taking into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the union's anger towards Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic buddy recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of disagreement-causing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries, for the most part, do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it did not want them either if they degrade social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie plan.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying that they are winning supporters of reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look inside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France,' they say from Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it goes to ruin in the same way that that happened to those who stayed too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain will have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie british, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the UK 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The re-negotiation had been arranged" and "the re-negotiation had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have bitterly experienced how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how skeptical the EU press monopolies are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum, inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about “direct bananas in the EU” when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
These included a diverse number of tax-exempt scoundrels, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but realized that if you’re in a cage with a lusty gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a bluff, unless you want to be on the gorilla’s lunch menu and later at dinner.
In fact, Mr Miliband was more blairish than Mr Blair himself when it comes to opposing the Cameron renegotiation stunt, because Mr Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Mr Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back of the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-embracing Neil Kinnock’s ’80s boycott of Murdoch, a strategy that was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official status in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed Europe.
Well, the majority of people outside the UK Independence Party’s war-goal enthusiasm and the Conservative Party’s fiercest nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and television this week, when her inner scout wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rough John McDonnell as Treasury Secretary of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the ’70s when his father-in-law was struggling on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's efforts were more appealing.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” – Benn’s statement – was not what McDonnell said, and not what Corbyn told heads of state and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of 24-hour television, and especially in the whirlwinds of social media, a breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take for granted the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic twist on EU membership (and aligned with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among leftist thinkers, for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal arguments.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning for extradition), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (even they have suspicious voters) to make concessions to Britain when it could be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England’s E-Cigarette Review
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had contacts with the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published this “milestone” report last month, describing it as “a comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several scientists have questioned the durability of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical magazine Lancet published an editorial attacking the "extraordinarily shaky bottom" of PHE's main conclusion.
Two other scientists who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health in Europe at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public expect PHE’s claim that “e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes according to the current best estimate” is based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people who developed a Multi-criteria Decision Analysis Model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, the CEO of which is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not from what they said they had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The criteria for selecting the members of the panel are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the field.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE Tobacco Director also attended the meeting.
The study, produced by the group, “recognises extensively” that there is a lack of “indisputable evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “there’s no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the allegations made by the BMJ had been answered in the past.
He says, “Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who smoke their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “give anything” for hits like this soap show on Albert Square.
Johnson said licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcasting times against competitors’ most watched programmes and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he was trying to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that are clearly suited to unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of his study on the future of the BBC.
If the licensing fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be broadcast at the most important time in order to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders is another, undoubtedly implemented inside the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is a public service broadcast.
I don’t think that would weaken the BBC at all.”
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting audiences “because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it’s the best way to achieve long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC’s public service programmes “go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC is thus fulfilling its responsibilities and can then hypocritically say, ‘Of course, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one is watching.’”
They put them in a broadcast spot where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is worth a lot, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot of money, because they don't spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its mission during Reith’s time to “inform, educate and entertain.”
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education -- he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio -- and that it should take the model of Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the task to "inform, educate and entertain."
When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms concerts, which, he said, will only be shown by a few on television, and co-operate with commercial companies so that all of these can be watched online.
"Sound Genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the shuttleworms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny shuttleworms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms show the effectiveness of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure whereby electrical impulses are introduced into people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Spaceworms do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified the ultrasound waves, which then pass into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they switch on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which needs to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to have the targeted human nerve cells momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisements put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International’s arms fair.
Horrible killing machines!
Ankle-crushing leg irons!
Grape bombs!
As well as electric stunners that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful sound and the imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advertisement of the world’s largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government’s willingness to trade arms to repressive regimes at a celebration in the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in the London shipyard area.

With the separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and subway trains, requiring a closer look.
"Important announcement, are you traveling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked together, using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
These 300 posters were created by artists whose works were exhibited at the Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of hex keys that, according to the group, "access one-third of the advertising space at the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "poster vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance fronts when they realize they have to go out into the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by an advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background commentator also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic corporate advertisement, but "it was more stopper to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at trade fairs,” says Amnesty International’s Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to arms fairs comes from within ExCeL as exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that he had received an order from the U.S. Army for a "shoulder-firing AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique tube loading combat tip, which targets excellent effects from behind the armor to the inside of the object".
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Housing
It's been 11 years since I, ignorantly, moved to a student residence at the age of 19, when I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the forced smiles of the people I've annoyed and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from nervous to totally scary.
It’s tempting to gossip: tell me where you’re from, if you had a break and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room”.
Take a breath.
And also help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and not the ones you wouldn’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they shared fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and general entertainment venues, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship.
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but in many dormitories, a culture of wandering from room to room is formed that is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can regain the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing — and maybe send a text to the door instead of knocking.
When you hear about knocking, knock.
A guy in my student dormitory thought that if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you’re starting college at the peak of the bakery trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate pastry plate and presenting yourself seems somewhat less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from the 50’s.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your cohabitants feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you know how to cook.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone’s chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my dorm mate who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn’t be making noise so that people can’t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot slamming the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music on, locked her doors, and went to the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same dormitory with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you thought of a dormitory partner as your future spouse, get together, get divorced, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot dorm partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try to make sense of your lower head.
In that exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between prank and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it can be canceled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something – but never mess up someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling at most twice.
Racist attack on accommodation for foreign students in Kitee - The house planned as a reception centre was ravaged in Salo
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students took place in Kitee, North Karelia, on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not the accommodation for minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping accommodation for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the Folklore Institute were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, the police of Eastern Finland said.
According to Luukkainen, who is the responsible teacher of social guarantee education for young people at the Folklore Institute, there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the target of vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move around, so some of them could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The school has residents of 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has an A status.
Some are studying at an adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, a news conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men who had been in a light car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, when this topic has now been on the surface.
"Nothing more serious," he said.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
The wall of the hospital was carved with a swastika cross and written "You are not welcome" in English.
A crime report has been filed with the police.

The state abolishes the Y-train to Karjaa - passengers chewed up, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news annoyed the passengers who boarded the train in the early evening at Helsinki Central Station.
The fall will hit the Siuntio people in particular, Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality, said.
It is completely idiotic, because the population is constantly growing and those who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video from HSTV that he will come to the capital even with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main line will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola’s station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced on Tuesday the routes from which the Ministry will purchase train services in the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year contract, which will be finalised in autumn, will later be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes we have made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y-train is also used by people other than Raseborg and Siuntio because it is fast and overtakes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those traveling farther away from the city area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trip," he said while struggling with the Y-train.
There will be a little relief.
There will probably be a new train service coming to the coastline, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transportation (HSL) area, i.e. it will take to Kirkkonummi.
This creates additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million a year for the Y-train, but the ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main course skips two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of trains doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services will decrease on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
More than half a million journeys are made annually on discontinued services, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is expected to bring the state savings of 12.3 million per year.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on Capital’s topicality: “Marx is worth exploring”
The crisis of the world economy has brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, to the surface, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former president of the SKP, in his book The Timeliness of Marx’s Capital, published today.
"He is taken more seriously now than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, its internationalization and penetration into all areas of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-sighted.
Sixten Korkman, a respected professor at Aalto University, is also on the list of authors of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical “now and forever.”
Isn’t the former CEO of the Institute of Economic Research and the Industry Delegation a Marxist?
No, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not see Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"It is a common perception that ideological history tells us about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s prophecies went terribly wrong.
While Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological upheaval,” Korkman explains.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx will not help.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, Marx is worth exploring, according to Korkman.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of the past.
“Every social scientist should become acquainted with Marx’s thinking—as with other classics,” Korkman says.
United Nations Calls for War Criminals to Be Sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN has called for a special tribunal to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka, according to the AFP news agency.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war was published on Wednesday after a lengthy delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, a large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces are accused of torture, abduction and systematic sexual assault, which is as likely to involve both men and women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides are said to have committed the murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but will not allow the creation of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo exam allowed social media to be weighed
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 students tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-word article in English could be addressed to the administrator of the advisory column of an online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Leelia’s Finnish lounge chair.
She asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the perspective of young people.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking upper secondary school in Porvoo.
The third topic was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth point, according to Lybeck, was quite nice.
It was about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing speech writing," Lybeck says, assessing the entire test as "quite normal."
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English exam, you could answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large amounts of data.
On Wednesday, some long-term writings were also written in Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Autumn writings will continue on Friday, when it is time for another Finnish or Swedish exam.
In high schools, the exam is organised normally, i.e. it is not affected by the protests of employees.
The Student Examination Board advises the candidates to find appropriate transport connections in time for the test session.
Additional time can also be granted if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a shop was robbed with a gun
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had received a small sum of money.
The case is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block the city centre on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK associations will meet at Rautatientori at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the protest.
The task of police officers at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the gigantic demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway square will be closed to motor vehicles between 9.30 and 14.00.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the roundabout of Kaisaniemi, starting from Mannerheimintie in the direction of the west.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Inspector-in-Chief Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems to be enough.
I will not comment on police work.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police aren't going to tell you the exact scouts.
"Something is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are advising to avoid using private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic swamp extends from the Hakaniemi level to its centre.
Stagnant traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With the arrival of demonstrators from elsewhere in Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed into the Railway Square.
The buses are initially far away.
The rest of the way is to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The protest will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly resolved by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go peacefully.
The people are ordinary employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday’s protest is exceptional in many ways – do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Not surprisingly, the movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporate tradition – and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s tough stance is missing in contract law.
There are a lot of signs that the trade union movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, there is also a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the steep division that the demonstration creates among the group that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland protested at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a point of reference for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Revolution Thursday in 1993, Siisinen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Breaking Thursday gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Aho (central) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earners’ organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now, the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was during the revolutionary Thursday.
Besides, the hardest bourgeois government in Finland ever is now in power, Siisinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tightly on the right, despite the speeches of the Finns.
There were still certain elements of the old working-class movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly shut down kindergartens and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement’s demonstrations have been quite peaceful – even though the methods of action have become harder in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict and is law-abiding.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
With EU membership, farmers were nervous about throwing eggs, and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The strike was interrupted by a proposal from the conciliation committee after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metalworkers received a 16% salary increase.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Breakthrough Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the House of Parliament to protest in favour of work.
Firefighters on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
In Espa, farmers drove tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancy eventually speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors on Strike in 2001
"Doctors on Strike - Forced Strike" was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and triggered a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched in favour of student aid from Senate Square to Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police explains the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in clarifying the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
All the people on the freezer were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says Superintendent Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees who travelled by truck in Austria suffered more fatally.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, who first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign background who is about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling.
A captain beating refugees, a former drug courier, and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, carry out human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, suggest solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat 'em up right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer pass.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chained captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more productive for a fisherman to carry people.
Emir has already done this hundreds of times on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he pleases.
Food is provided so that customers can barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
The first night you drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and the next night you drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he's beating up his clients, and at least he's claiming to beat up the hangers to death.
He says in the book that when he was caught by the police, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear his compatriots have to beat him for this.
I'm gonna beat 'em up right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
An ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova<0xC5><0xA1>a, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is at its last and it has seen its best days anyway.
For Goran’s customers, however, the most important thing is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are admitted.
In the forests around the city centre, men traveling without their families are accommodated in tents, ledges and abandoned cars, which anyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a area, a major hub of human trafficking, people are dying of fatigue.
Goran's cyclists are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once, and that's enough," says Goran.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
That's not what Goran likes.
He's a fool. He's a fool all the way.
First you agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and then they offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I’m just doing my job and helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most of them conveniently on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or a quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a pretty nice annual income.
Serbia has ruled that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants within 12 kilometers of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and swings away.
The Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called the Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, where many Congolese refugees visit, as well as a small centre to help Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a work of mercy.
For a missionary, it's important to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band on the white underwear elegantly peeks under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer will initially call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money tightly and stumbling among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from, for example, North Kivu war zones and that they have had to flee their homes for violence.
Often this is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old ID card will be destroyed and replaced by another one.
The missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police will help with that.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, handling a humanitarian organisation about EUR 150, and the migration process, for example, to a European country costs between EUR 4,500 and 7,000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually two or three people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving on the A26, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for arranging illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom picks the right truck, makes sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cuts the safety wire from the cover.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a frying pan or oven potato in the kitchen.
That's supposed to keep the police's thermal scanner from detecting anyone hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the truck hoping that the driver won’t snub the clandestine passengers, at least before the UK.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
The Upporic Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal invasion of the Mediterranean, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he is only demanding the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury boat scam: in Turkish ports, yachts are rented to take American or European families on comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are packed full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul on land to a port and from there to Europe by sea for a fee of between 5,000 and 7,000 euros.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are put in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under cover throughout the journey.
The coast guard can only observe how far the ship is swimming, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53,000 for one luxury boat trip after expenses.
He does not take care of the practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other minors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are arranged and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have purchased land through covert companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.

American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has a new book that has caught attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top form and ran the second best time in qualifying.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other racers passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I pushed myself over the finish line," Favor Hamilton said in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but were fascinated by the idea of getting money to have sex with strangers.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton’s price was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he craved the same kind of adrenaline spikes he had received when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the magazine Smoking Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's top ranked player in the 1,500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
World Champion rejoiced when the federation put Norway's ski rooster under control: "Lightback"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of fitness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the whole summer and autumn as they did last year’s athletes’ contract.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup.
The decision was praised by double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put a ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one athlete to avoid working for the union's sponsor," he said.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is a matter of money.
Northug apparently wants to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent an alliance that will also care for future generations and not let one athlete stand alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has granted Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug announced on Tuesday that he would like to play in Norwegian colours for the World Cup next season, as well as at the World Cup and the Olympic Games afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals, including two gold medals.
He was in Falun last winter with a team that won message gold.
The shield day of fried translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Kilpipäivä on 25 September, rallies will be held in different restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Finnish Fries Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-level food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as raise awareness of the importance of the shield as a part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the metropolitan area, but top restaurants that are inspected and ranked by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received at the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of raising awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation’s most significant international events, which will be held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complained to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are cooperating to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava Army, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy, is still permanently located in the area.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to the private person, placing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and the airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre.
In the case of Kauhava airport, negotiations have been taking place over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among other things, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
An individual tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about a principled objection to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava’s city government discussed the reception centre affair last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
“Governance means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions,” Niinistö told reporters in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in his residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, the concern about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tensions in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
According to Finavia, the operations of airports are to be carried out during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Protest closes downtown streets in Helsinki
A demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of the city centre.
Police say the streets leading to Rautatientori will be closed from cars around 9.30-14.
Cars are not allowed from Mannerheimintie towards Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Union Street towards Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people taking part in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers during the whole Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday’s demonstration of morning traffic from the beginning to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and subway personnel told STT about this in the evening.
Most of the Alkos will be closed for two hours, including post offices closed
Friday’s protest also disrupts Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of day-post.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’ blood shipments will be carried out despite the strike.
Food transport, hospital shipments and laboratory samples will also be handled.
You can find information about the services on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alkos will close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The service union Pam has instructed its employees to stop working between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to participate in a trade union demonstration.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores will be kept open with managerial forces if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual trades.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
The day care centres in Helsinki will not be fully operational on Friday, reports the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education.
Due to the protests of trade unions, childcare may be concentrated in certain kindergartens, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour daycare centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with mental disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to announce further changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs versatile channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct talk channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches will become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as channels, we'll see.
We’re going to use this channel tonight, he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to the public.
The issue we are discussing here is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not tell about a more general government introspection.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more firmly into their own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen from the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of a recent comment by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at the announcement of Sipilä.
It would be strange if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not announcing things in a democracy.
By definition, it is the task of the media to strive for the agendas of politicians not to be taken as given.
According to Koivus, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more today than we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Even if it is not a special situation, it is a routine conversation among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be stigmatised as the media of politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or the general line.
Cunning from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where she is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, the TV speech is a cunning move from Sipila, because in this way he is able to express his own view without the sound of gravel.
This way, the message will reach a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike in a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
There is, however, a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech, because they will not be allowed to ask specific questions.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether the sweat runs out, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If you are able to present your case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here a person seems to be talking directly to another person.
This is what President Obama and his partners do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
Employee organisations will hold a demonstration on Friday and strikes against the government’s actions.
The Chairman of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
Chairman of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he will challenge Sipilä to the dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine at the time.
The boy has been found and his father has updated his Facebook page.
The Inner-Finnish Police Department also confirms this to the Iltalehti newspaper.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
Thank you to all the people who helped me find it.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappoints young people with violent temptation: You are causing hatred
The Kurdish fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a weighty speech against the street fights of young people.
Born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC league.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the youth's fad.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people in the country, sit on top of the other, and slap blindly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this, Amirkhani says.
Difficult to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, the fight videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from native Finland.
It's just that you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku recalls.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageous.
It's a little hard, boys, to justify you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be strangers here for quite some time.
“That’s a different way to thank you for being here,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you can blame yourself for it.
Now think about it a couple of times before you go along with it, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You make me hate things that I don’t like.
You're going through quite badly anyway, and with that going on, you're not going to improve it at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, said on Twitter that on Monday the employees’ association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Finnish Employees’ Confederation (STTK) said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the Government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee association, SAK, soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, commented on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the Bureau of the SAK will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that instead of coercive laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that the Prime Minister’s Government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously interrupted negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: The big demonstration threatens to go west - "It feels a little silly to put on a fist"
It feels a bit funny to stick your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from one side to the other.
Is it a question of overthrowing the government or even agreeing with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK blew up holy hatred towards the Republican government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to akavas, too.
The teachers’ union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the Finnish Employees’ Centre, gave a conciliatory speech.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap, as requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hurried to announce that her compromise paper had already been prepared.
At first, there was no sign of the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to agree when the federal leaders ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Mr Lyly announced that the Bureau of the SAK would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for a joint proposal to emerge, SAK should be willing to accept a 5% productivity jump as a target.
It is no wonder that Palolan STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s Board of Directors.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Influence at STTK, was previously a special assistant to the prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government’s trade union expertise has been improving all the time.
By chance or not, Palola’s exit took a little bit of the momentum away from the Finnish stagnants, whose forehead is Marko Piirainen (sd) from AKT.
It feels a little funny to put your fist on if you already have some reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information from Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: “This must not happen again”
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE summit.
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin made extensive remarks about the July Helsinki jubilee meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union's sanctions list, to come to the meeting - an issue that the President would remind journalists about.
In our opinion, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also prevented from entering.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without complications, so Naryshkin continued to spit on Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no barriers to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who is in charge of the meeting in Ula Bator, who has already discussed with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Painting tight"
Killpara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakamets today, when they are both on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual paint festivals in Hakamets today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to win a 3-2 continuation time win from Kalpa.
The rise was masculine, as last season the silver team was at its worst from the loss of two goals.
Tuesday was more victorious.
The guest of the Blues, who started the catch in a tricky way, was round zero points, and the loss scores were also 2-3.
The game is tough, the goals are tight, if any, they play the same game as last year, Lukko-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setups on the club’s website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma people.
In the last two seasons, Tappara has just dropped from the Luko final series in the semi-finals.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match was required.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara climbed to the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the groups except for goalkeepers.
Those who rejected both yesterday will get a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhusse, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lock poles.
Point of view: an awful play going on in Ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he himself starred.
The underdog was sensationally struggling with heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky’s premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
To everyone's surprise, the anonymous and wooden-handed batch progressed to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele from Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this novelty works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the sports manager of Azsie has built a batch of roast beans on the back of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in the backyard like rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are somewhere other than in rolled-up gaming.
Toivola has forgotten that the main role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There's no other Rocky in Iron Rocky than a nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing and a little bitch.
He appreciates the hard game, but it’s different to play hard than a pig.
Assien Garret Stafford hit Tappara against Jere Karjalainen.
He was given 2+10 minutes by the judges, but Iron Calio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don’t approve of such a game and it doesn’t belong in the ace hockey, after the game the hot Iron Cali woke up to Satakunta People.
The team for this season is strangely built.
There are punks, veterans, cops, gunners.
There are virtually no key players at the best playing age.
It's no wonder the head coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the purchases and, unfortunately, the situation in the market was rather limited,” Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface, it's sizzling.
The 1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men’s contracts expire in the spring.
The Aces' balance in the three league matches of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuppi
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen performs for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Tuukka Temosen, the former bass player and director of Apulanna since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot before, but now for the first time Olga is acting under the direction of Tuuka.
Olga’s role in the film You made us beautiful is played by Sipe Santapuppi’s mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka pacifies and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Luckily, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only person in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would be the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really depressing.
There was a fairly small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about his youth even before the film plans.
Sometimes the parents’ stories are a little different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how much do parents really know what you were doing?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that he is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, the couple in Iitta often plan to drive home overnight for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive drama film in Finland
The Iron Sky: The Coming Race film, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Filming starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky: The Coming Race will become Finland’s most expensive feature film of all time with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will pass Iron Sky 2 with a budget of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The big budget isn't scared.
I have been so sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Even if the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big story.
However, you could get <0x24>100 million in the movie because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tightly twisted that there isn't any looseness.
The film’s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched on Wednesday a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4% to 8%.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Cock or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or t-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a jerk.
But times change.
Sporting has become a megatrend of fashion, and old, familiar sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have also risen to the forefront of coolness.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really junk, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. standard fashion, where trendsetters were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as a way to stand out from the mass.
Now instead of the grey basic college, we put on the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas’ recognizable striped sweaters, favorite team shirts and the New York Yankees caps have also made their way back into street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the jeans are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace’s autumn blouses makes it clear what brand the garment is.
Would you be willing to showcase your logos in your dress?
Russian politician published proof: I did not get stuck in the hatch of a tank for hours!
It is alleged that a strange incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, which presents the products of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian emergency ministry had to remove Zotov from a large tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything possible to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a pretty good mood, and at least according to those pictures it is not about getting stuck or getting angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside a battle tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, a lieutenant colonel, and have served in the Urals.
I went in, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck and I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
Zotov told Russian Army TV that he admired Russia’s new technology, as he is himself a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what was inside the wagon, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the tailgate, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
“I’m tall and robust, but nothing that would get stuck somewhere in the tank happened,” he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged jam have been published, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people attended the arms show in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's jam originated from a Bloknot.ru article in which Zotov was told that he was struggling to get out of the tank door and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the organisers of the exhibition shared their views on what had happened.
Everyone is just accustomed to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," the exhibition coordinator, Alexander Pisarevsky, told Bloknot.

The candlestick by the Architect Brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that’s what it was originally.
Architectural brothers are known to grind the shape of the candle for a long time and with mathematical accuracy.
Initially, it was presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of renowned brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
The cube is available in black, white and nickel and copper.
The candlestick is current and suitable for many types of homes.
It has recently been one of the favorite items of interior bloggers.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The gold mine’s purified process water has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The reservoir contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, drained through a surface drainage field into the environment.
The amount of leakage was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material drained into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the basin.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about 600 permanent employees.
The IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also slight differences.
The IMF’s assessment has a lot to say about the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Financial Times.
In the IMF’s view, growth projects should also be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF foresees a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, Danske predicts in its new cyclical forecast that growth will be at zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output has been growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
The weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators may again have received less attention.
However, the differences are only a few decimal points of 1%.
Recovering from death, Nintendo appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked for Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as a possible successor to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo into mobile gaming, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service admitted that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear every year.
The Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear “underground” in a year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be due to the fact that the case reveals that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, out of which 134 applications were made due to the fact that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
This year, by 6 September, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaided minors.
There are no overall statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers missing this year, but the number of minor asylum seekers is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stressed.
What about the decision to return?
Will they also disappear into the “dark labour market”?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for enforcing deportation decisions, Kannelma stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU’s meeting of home affairs ministers, spoke on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media industry who lost his ability to work due to illnesses, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells devices on Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
It was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasini.
Nowadays, a large part of the equipment has been left behind by technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these will also be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkosets are trying to move out of their current Myrskylän home.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
I’ve started to make inventories and see what I’m giving up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
Following recent strokes, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to collect boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to become porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
The subway and tram drivers will decide today whether they will extend the force in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief trustee, says that the stakes are high on the field.
Night and shift cuts are very painful for drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the allowances are provoking opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be practically completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses will be left in the depot.
The members of the ACP are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the superior forces, says HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services run on Friday.
Employee organisations will hold a major demonstration at Helsinki Rautatientori on Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, the news agency AP said.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media reports, the Hungarian police had also used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas after teacher thinks watch is a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a schoolteacher said his watch was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no time has it been found that Muhammad claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohammed, the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in police custody, but it was said to have consisted of a printed circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of compulsory school leave.
Her father is furious about the incident and the U.S.-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by MEPs from Corbyn’s own labour party.
This has offended the public, Labour MP Kate Green said in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined in the song.
Yesterday's memorial ceremony commemorates the British Air Force's fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by taking part in the event.
We all owe tremendous debts to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the National Anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the labour.
Particularly among the MPs, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament for the first time today in his capacity as party leader during Question Time with the Prime Minister.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted this weekend about Corbyn's election as party leader.
“The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families,” the prime minister tweeted.
The cause of the Minnesota family death is still unclear - the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota, for a week.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for Days
The family was found after worrying about the absence of children at school.
According to this announcement, the police went into the house for a visit and found the Short family dead all over the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Millionaire and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitari is still under investigation.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short reported that the site had four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 bids from the company in the last ten years.
I have abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe I’ll sell the company sometime, but not yet.
In 2011, the Short family bought Greenwood for <0x24>2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage enough for eight cars.
Litigation pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments were removed from Short’s website and, as a result, they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Monthly Horse Owner Award.
This is great, Loiri commented with a good mood on her medal.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of the Fabrice Duo in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse’s coach Korpi gets complete peace of mind when working with Loiri.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri chuckled.
The NHL star's stunning gesture - "The biggest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated <0x24>10 million to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation of an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital raise other funds for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year deal with the Canadians for <0x24>72 million a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his <0x24>9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby that bears his name from the hospital.
The Canadians have already made significant contributions to local hospitals.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge sum of money for another large hospital in the city, which provided the hospital with a PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife from the Japanese cafeteria for the evening - serves food only in a bikini and an apron
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a halal café and now a wife’s café.
It strikes lonely, socially ill, and hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from the Ore no Yome (My Wife) cafe in Tokyo.
It's a waiter pretending to be the client's wife.
The "spouse" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is just wearing an apron and a bikini, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the candidates, from height and weight to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks on car information security have begun to equip
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The panel consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future based on the results of ASRB research.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, some 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, generating and sharing web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can consolidate best practices in security and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford’s Focus RS has been on the rise for years.
The car is also starting to appear in Finland.
Ford has revealed RS data now that the world of cars is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new all-wheel-drive RS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, initially it is reported to be EUR 52,000.
The car is already available for order, although Ford will not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Favorite brand Kia introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the most important of the two innovations is the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture a larger share of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of European Design Director Gregory Guillaume, the Sportage is rounder than before.
The shaft spacing and the external dimensions have increased by one centimetre and the car penetrates the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo engine with 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be told closer to the launch.
We will have to wait a bit longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optima arrived in our country.
Suddenly, it doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with improved driving performance, lower noise levels and a higher level of equipment.
The Optimo is equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the addition of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
About the same time with its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returns to the stage with a brave jumpsuit
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue trouser suit has an impressive, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer star.
It is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to lose weight during pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
Returning to the stage and standing in front of the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I’ve missed everything about music, the singer says.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release a new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Is Astonishing Again
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one topic after another.
She is showing her pregnancy belly and breasts in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 AM, when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left a gig with her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-coloured bra underneath the dress when the lightning flashes.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity dress was when she went to a friend's dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was emphasized by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last Friday, when I was on the show with a pregnancy belly.
The Hard Laws of Modeling: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
She made her own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues talk about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you’ve been posing in top designer outfits in the previous season, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for jobs with the ranks.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The job is continuous travel and can go even a year, so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of slimness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose kilos, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
In fashion trends, models and designers are together all the time and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the divorce is sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are devoured by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a show of clothes.
Models want to be their own characters.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
Fashion Weeks are currently taking place in New York, where designers will unveil their next year’s collection.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays Apulanta, the most unknown musician in the film
In the film based on the early years of Apulanta, Roope Salminen plays the band’s founder Antti Lautala.
Lautala formed Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I’m a rapper who’s about to turn 26, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I didn’t want to meet the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is obviously the most unfamiliar to people in this group, so I think it's good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don’t want to imitate a human being.
The man who runs the band Scrooge Salminen and Dogs completely empty doesn’t go into the role.
Punk maneers come naturally to man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many of you saw the first taste, as well as if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, we always go full-fledged.
The main actors of the film “Make Us Beautiful” directed by Tuukka Temosen, who played bass in Apulan in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The band’s core audience is presented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bass player Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip on his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted on Instagram a picture of his new look, which he has had to make for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen with a moustache and a chin beard, has shaved his face to silo and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist Advises: How to Tell Children About Refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees seeking to come to Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the matter, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children should be protected and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and anguish, she says.
However, if a child has come across news photos of refugees on television or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a conversation about the starting point of the child and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
Your child’s fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
There is no point in frightening a child, even if you are anxious and frightened.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how this is perceived in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different upbringing perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker ones"
Your strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
The ball flash that hits the vermo is difficult to contain
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone the striking impact of Clover Ball Light in midsummer.
It only drove victories and second places until at the end of July the Tampere rally collapsed.
Since the stallion was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the veterinarian.
Explaining the exhaustion was clear in an endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medicine to cure it.
Since Apila’s Ball Light had to be light exercised, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
In record time, it was the second SE oak in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Clover’s Ball Light was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Considering these things, the small inclination in the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good race made the stallions feel better.
The horse’s temperament certainly moved on from there, and I hope it would have stabilized as well.
Clover's Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it wasn't fun, it could have thrown it into fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has loosened such a lightning note that the opponents have been astonished.
At the fastest speed, competitors can’t beat Ball Lightning, where even warm-blooded rides fall off.
The wish of the Nordics is a pee-run in Vermo.
What is different, however, is how the Ball Lightning of the Clover agrees to it.
It’s quite difficult at the time of departure, and it may even tip under the boom of the starter car and all that.
Hopefully he will be calmer than when he leaves.
Clover’s Ball Light can also come from the bow when it’s in order, and we’re going to drive it for victory, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all of them.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, said in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
There are a number of apps on Apple’s iPhone that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newspapers, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these apps is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple’s apps is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to something else on your iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation declined to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only 0.1 per cent year-on-year in August, the EU's statistical authority, Eurostat, said today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s forecast for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In the whole of the 28 EU countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro countries, consumer prices rose by 1.4 per cent in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was at its lowest when prices fell by 1.9 %.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target of a price increase of around 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent next year, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely in three years after the Fed starts raising its interest rates again.
In the financial markets, the downturn begins before the next downturn.
The Fed has suggested it will start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession may hit its fastest by next autumn, and the financial markets will rhythm before that.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets operate as they used to – and if they react to the Fed’s extortion of money faucets as they have done in the past.
These are the conclusions of Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large customers last week.
The study and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use cool facts and calculations to present economic statistics on how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another pattern as at the time of previous interest rate increases – and what the consequences may be.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile position to withstand the rise in interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
The leaders deciding on the Fed’s monetary policy and its current tune have been insinuating throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in over nine years can be expected this week.
The matter will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The Fed raised its Fed Funds interest rate in June 2006.
That ended exactly two years of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage point increases, with the Fed raising interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial symptomatology began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
There was a major recession in 2009.
Last time, the severe hardships in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the previous Fed interest rate increases.
Similarly, the trials were harsher and harsher than they have been since the recession in the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have been screening the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies and the turning points of the financial markets since 1950 and in places since the early 19th century.
The Fed’s interest rate increases and their economic and financial impacts have been reported since the 1950s.
At its fastest, it has taken less than a year, in most cases less than three years and on average less than three and a half years, to start the recession.
The rise in the financial market has ended within one to two years of the Fed’s interest rate increases.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, the Fed has raised and lowered its interest rate for a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has been different in some respects, and the multiplier is relatively scarce in the review, so it is hardly possible to draw any definite conclusions on the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
It reminds me that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Heels too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably determined even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched the techno bubble's tracks, and they raised the next one.
2) The accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades increased even more as a result of the monetary policy of central banks overlapping.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history.
3) Especially the insanely cheap debt financing, which was packed into the financial economy almost without any restraint, inflated the largest bubbles in the history of the financial market, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is also unlikely that there will be a very harsh dispute that the financial markets, relying on ever more complex leverage, were in an extremely dangerous and unstable state of affairs when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures tuned to the leverage of debt, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last longer than their time, after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubbles and more debt
The German strategists do not speculate on what will happen next, but they give reason to think about things such as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary stance even lighter for longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been cheaper for a long time than it was ten years ago, but now debt is literally cheaper at its cheapest than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but is now heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis in different parts of the economy.
3) Liquidity issued by central banks, which has become more fluid and cheaper, has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed key securities and assets to their highest levels since the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do the strategists have a latitudinal atmosphere with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades, as it has done in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money faucets more tightly.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has been coaching the bank’s international investor clients for the following Fed turnarounds for quite some time:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to extinguish the financial flames with even bigger QE money sprays.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted at HP’s corporate services, the company says.
HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise in November and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of <0x24>2.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced from 25000 to 30000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries, with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the previous year, its three most significant customers brought in 65 per cent of operating profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is complete, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation after the "Software Update Failed" error message appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic jam to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update, and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests the apps you want to remove and then reinstall them once the update is complete.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it may lead to the update being corrupted.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involved so-called tax planning.
It is the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner said he had filed for resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed for resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on the agreed schedule,” Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through a Luxembourg-based company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on Karelia-Upofloor’s Board of Directors from 2010-2013 and, after the merger, on Kährs’ Board of Directors and on a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg passes through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg-based company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This property is owned by Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure the realisation of the capital benefits of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we make sure that the profits of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Triton, the largest shareholder of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Company-maintained reception centre opens in Espoo
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first company-maintained reception centre for adult asylum seekers will be opened.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first hundred residents as early as 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to 300-400 within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre on the former Rescue College’s property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which specialises in the provision of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agreed on the security arrangements of the Centre, among other things.
STTK prepares alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for the government’s extortion of working life.
The organization is also looking for other employees’ unions.
According to President Antti Palola, the focus is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break from the organisation’s administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no readiness for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change protection included in the Government’s competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, while the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I do not know if a party has a tremendous enthusiasm to have a conversation if there is a one-to-one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: The negotiation process was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is due to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing the reforms.
Paloma did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the Government, and it has always been constructive to him.
According to Palola, cutting the Sunday allowances on the field of the Finnish Employees’ Federation (STTK) is a painful place.
The organization demands that the government withdraw from compelling legislation to carry out some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP, which discussed the matter.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government’s proposed blackmail package last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary for the first sick days will be cut, overtime payments will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
It is stressed from the STTK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and it was not the intention to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder praises the announcement of the STTK to prepare an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akava for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, hopes that SAK, headed by Lauri Lyly, will join us in preparing the proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change insurance and working time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitiveness jump as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country,” Fjäder said.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, let them work together" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's bingo voucher for the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä revolt and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for a similar speech from the previous Prime Minister, we must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a television speech.
Monologue, monarchist affairs
The speech of Sipilä has sparked criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, "the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP on Facebook condemned the “monarchist affair: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them.”
Antti Rinne, the chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Soon after six months of the elections.
Not a single appearance from the prime minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
He was criticized for his speech.
We considered the matter and noted that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity throughout Finland, says Director of Yle Publications Ismo Silvo Yle in the news.
As in the days of the Tamms
The speech also aroused mockery.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed to their best.
Mom wears a pretty collar and dad fits a tie around his neck.
At nine o’clock, we sit down in front of the TV like we used to in Me Tammeloide time,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Will Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaires sitting in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens, drafting pardon laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they must cut when the state is out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
As for what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the University of Tampere’s Green Left, Viva.
It has posted the following bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia’s proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of power, President Martti Ahtisaari told The Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan that would allow al-Assad to withdraw from power in style after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal because it believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tchurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral conversation: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be in immediate contact and the abdication of al-Assad had to be carried out in moderation.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, “Sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment
Ahtisaari said he had forwarded Tchurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Chhurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words for it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups had refused any agreements to keep him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s remarks because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tchurkin spoke with Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about Mr Churkin’s speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin’s trick to keep the power with some of Assad’s supporters.
The Refugee Flow of Our Own Works
During the talks in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own fault.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused,” Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum applicants' organisation centre to be forced to Tornio
The asylum seeker organisation centre planned by the Government for Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tornio joint lyse building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
Sauli Hyöppinen, vice-president of Tornio City Council (left), said this was not the case.
When the whole council was not present and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present.
Thirteen delegates opposed the organization.
On that basis, you could expect a positive decision, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was responded quickly.
It could accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), halving the public holiday allowance would only take care of part of the government’s goal of lowering the price of labour.
However, the Government would be happy to accept the alternative package if the social partners can agree on such a package.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for ways to compensate for the blackmail announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, halving holiday allowances would work as a means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday allowances.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a reduction in holiday allowances, as they are entered into collective agreements rather than law.
The Government is expected to inform Parliament next Wednesday of the blackmail in working life as a Government statement.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
This is when the legislative work starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it becomes more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time now.
It doesn’t take long, if you have the will to do things like this.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the transformation of Epiphany and Heatorsta into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for first sick days will be cut, overtime allowances will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
In addition to the large-scale demonstration organised on Friday by the trade union organisations, several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves expansion of juice hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s warehouse, i.e. the juice hall.
This is because the project is bigger and more expensive than originally mentioned.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a bit surprising that the space requirement was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided later in the interim report.
At the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated price would be EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it would bring work and tax revenues to the local community.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian language has a place in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous stance to bring Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian is not an inherent part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has belonged more to the Eastern Savo dialects.
After the new decision, there will be no Karelian-language street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also advisable to be open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a characteristic of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both can be used in a variety of marketing activities in the region.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the county with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all,” says Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.
He also raises the issue of air transport, a continuation of which has also been mentioned on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that our chances of coping are not reduced by state measures, as is currently the case.
We should look at the effects of these closures of transport links, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research staff, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because of poor cross-border connections.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
Of these, about 10-20 per cent are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
From Joensuu there was one gravel sound for Siu's war
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is among them.
Member of the City Board Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) proposed to abandon the entire project at the Board meeting on Monday, but his proposal fell unprofitable.
The Board approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s draft decision, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although fewer than one pair of trains.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains leaves, but you can still get from Kotka to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The cuts are due to state austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for rail traffic will decrease by EUR 12.3 million for the next four-year period.
The quietest routes are completely closed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out
The Rescue Department let a 12-year-old climbing the roof out of a climber, who couldn’t get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder leading to the roof at all.
That didn’t stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
The rest of the boys went down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away and the passers-by alerted the emergency services to help the last person on the roof safely return to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit doubles, lowering prospects for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results from the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast due to weakened demand for freight services and its higher ground costs.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
By this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening hour.
FedEx Corp. says it expects to earn <0x24>10.40 to <0x24>10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected <0x24>10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on January 4, and despite higher surcharges starting in November for heavy or large parcel land transport.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because of cuts in expenses, increased turnover and growing e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "is performing steadily, taking into account the worse-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for hiring UPS for the holidays were announced the day after competitor UPS announced that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra employees, roughly the same amount it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Profits per share were <0x24>2.42, which is behind the <0x24>2.44 average forecast. A survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5% to <0x24>12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority shipping, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the most recent quarter, the net sales of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues from operations were basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and self-insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased due to higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by <0x24>3.85, or 2.5%, to <0x24>150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent of the bill for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, the Federal Reserve will sit for two days around a huge mahogany table at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation first.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank’s shoulders: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, the governors of the central bank have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be the decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted, a decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record incentive brought by the near-zero short-term interest rates until the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made central bank officials, who are already on the lookout, more alarmed when it comes to increasing instability. There are fears about how it would affect if the federal fund rate reference value were raised by at least a quarter of a percentage point.
“Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for keeping interest rates unchanged, then increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid enough reason to wait," he said.
There has been no consensus on the central bank’s decision, which in itself creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of economists predict interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as according to the key indicator, the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This implies a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless policy makers then manage to mitigate the shock by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they will have to put a lot of effort into their policies to support the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that a higher level would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
While job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, the lowest rate in seven years and close to what the central bank sees as the limit for full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation remains below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the main reason for this is, according to the central bank’s decision-makers, the temporary effect of a significant drop in oil prices.
The economy “survives and needs higher interest rates in view of the tight labour market conditions,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief economics expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world shook last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by up to 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below its peak in May.
For central bank policymakers, market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation that tells when interest rates need to be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks about the weakness of China’s economy, policy makers would tighten the standard at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Specialist and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and they have little information at their disposal regarding the consequences of the events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not a central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the insinuation by the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could “reduce” the amount of money added, caused upheavals in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc., an asset management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the past, the central bank has overreacted to financial market movements that seem to have been separated from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a member of the committee with the right to vote, refers to the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, "despite its limited, recognisable impact on U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only give priority to financial stability during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Interest Rate Commission.
The latest turmoil is not even close to its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where there is fear of interest rate increases because the market is getting upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think that they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Pediatrics Association in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Society (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven Channel’s Sunrise is a favorite in viewing, despite Nine Channel’s attempts to announce a directorial announcement on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic’s and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader’s revelation failed to increase Today’s audience.
The nine-channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stranded in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise had an average audience of 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 in Today.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, while Today has an average of 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news of the seven-channel was the 800-word series featuring the amazing premiere of former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which scored a rather impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson could be the driving force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave us real certainty.
Seven’s The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour (17-17.30) show attracted an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators -- enough for a small win on Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour average audience was 520,000, and the second half-hour average was a staggering 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night average drop gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire’s program.

The final three agree with dads that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor has been kept in the utmost secrecy.
The three remaining girls aren’t sure who got the last rose.
However, when talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue about the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women became poetic when they described Wood as the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as the reasons they would like to be his partner.
When asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?”, their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah’s] energies and Sam’s energies seemed to be quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that clearly this isn’t just a game – I’m now wholeheartedly involved,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can tell," he said.
I like the other girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball on his first flight kickback when the team defeated Minnesota on Tuesday, counting 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and took her into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula’s true character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of defaming his newcomers as potters in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flight kick that the Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way out of the field after a drop, and later told Australian radio squad Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own finish area led to Queensland finishing.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for his Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Elton John meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed in police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd that protested against the country's new constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area, about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's top official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom were throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that new provinces established under the proposed new constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal, as the Tharus group calls for a state of its own.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
This week, legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde.
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 kilometers south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde group of islands, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
The second precise low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane over the next two days, the Miami Weather Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for humanitarian organizations that are helping thousands of refugees who have come to Europe to escape from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of an announcement by the director, a Google employee, Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations are made to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would pay the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeeelief, up to <0x24>5.5 million, with a total target of <0x24>11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are treated by other means than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the mortality data," notes Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgeon who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery uses various methods to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight to height ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If your BMI is over 25, it indicates that you are overweight, and if your BMI is over 30, you are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, with medications for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of surgical patients decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those who were treated by other means than surgery remained roughly the same in 29 subjects.
Of the surgical patients, 36% had a complete cure and 28% had a partial cure.
In comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as the "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients’ blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
The haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers wrote.
Postoperative haemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the drug treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better “glycemic control,” described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared with the group undergoing gastric surgery to reduce the weight, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (17.7 and 14.2 kg), had lowered their BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), had lowered their haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46,
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix's Blackstone says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings in Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese patients undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within a 15-year period when compared with a group who had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show any improvement in surgical survival, Blackstone says the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 and who are interested in surgery.
“The findings are decisive precisely because they show that surgery is safe for a group with a lower body mass index,” he says, “and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease.”
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that will permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening ceremony of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, which is devoted to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that, while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, arguing that the violent response of the United States caused a series of violent events.
“After the 9/11 attack, I sent a letter of condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used force and that created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, ingestion of hand disinfectant by children has increased fourfold
Poisoning centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in the ingestion of highly alcoholic hand disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Center.
According to Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of cases of ingestion of disinfectant reported to poisoning centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are on call," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get low-cost booze.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with an alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectant smells can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hand dish) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain anything between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please don’t leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand disinfectant is left in sight, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to an emergency room to be treated.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit for drunken driving in adults, says Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed while speaking and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible symptoms of brain injury, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
This could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisonings, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York State planned to poison their “evil” teacher by spreading bactericidal poison into the classroom, police said in a report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as "foolish nonsense" and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.

Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “The highlights of Celtic’s games will no longer be shown in the Netherlands, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
The people here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also non-Scottish people like to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the consequent drop in the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men and is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had some bad episodes before, and we're going to get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
It's important to stay together now.
Warburton warns of January transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January transfer targets, he is wary of the recruiting frenzy, reassuring that he does not want to confuse unanimity with the crew.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire pre-season period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea's striker Michu, whose name is associated with the transfer window to the Celtic, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has had an ankle discomfort for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the pitch, and the team subsequently lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card to be revoked by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson insists, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded for admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skaceli.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a momentary impulse," the attacker said, adding, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's board believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of Dundee United still has faith in the leadership team’s ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the deterioration of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back together again," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy with 'ugly victory' in Hamilton's game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperate to play against Hamilton Acces, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, raising them to the top of the table by five points above Celtic.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won anything, be it a trophy or a league, that hasn’t won the games this way either.”
Unemployment in Scotland will remain the same as the UK
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK’s 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I witness the execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention of any kind, I will see him executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the audience at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was upset, I agreed.
I'm starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, participants are selected through a terrifying lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced media coverage from 12 to 15.
Whoever is chosen will see the event as cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also established my own connection with him through calls made over the months and one visit of two and a half hours.
I like a man.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to save what I have seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get involved.
I complained to reporter.
He admitted that "he could have put his words better", but still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do that even if he said it.
I have told him that he can remove me from his Witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my podcasts.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him guilty of complicity.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view that I see him dying.
I cannot claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'm going to give you a description of what it's like to watch the man I like die unnecessarily.
Woman seduced from Canning River after police hunt
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just a few feet away from a policeman who was trying to "gently lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn’t get very far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "decent police consultation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when they're trying to escape," said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blows and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody accuses officials of trying to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s agents tried to infiltrate his spies into his stables last year and threaten to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the officials and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to a medical procedure performed on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He has been keeping his tongue in check over spy allegations for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like jealousy.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything explodes at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head upright and I want the owners to think I’m doing my best for them.
“When they start thinking differently, I’m not going to be a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he said that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stables.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — I’ll name him when asked — and offered him a job at my stables if he passed on information about what I’m doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, I think they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps to pass on the responsibility of what is happening in the field to others besides the coaches?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now may make them think about that.
But now I'm at a point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I will press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with the long-term study of Lidar’s cobalt, and his late rejection led him to conclude that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of the day's treatment "funny" after putting a mud or clay bath at the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his foot.
It could have had a tomb last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month ban on competitions due to the incubation treatment on the race day, which the officials began to investigate.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand the need for rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram for traffic offence
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist in Cobra this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling arguments
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team's tackles would be part of the "linear".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his side when he unexpectedly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to Storm after defeating the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a rugby league "show window" and said the two Queensland teams weren't "hardened" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended the tackles of his team and said that they would only focus on "contact" in tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was enhanced by the criticism of the two leading coaches against Storm, which means they fear they will lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or techniques throughout the year. Over the last six weeks, we have only emphasized contact in tackle, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously he has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so this was a small shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He felt it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was.”
I remember in 2010 St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more point-rich than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break a defensive line and not score a goal?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has free time this weekend as they have already won a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-finals at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man on <0x24>200,000 in drug charges
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a <0x24>200,000 bail.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 pounds of drug on the Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the other accused at the marina all morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 pounds of drug in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic is threatened with life imprisonment for an attempt to possess a commercially intended amount of cocaine, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maximovic was attempting to possess the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafeteria for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was worried that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a <0x24>200,000 bail to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both individuals, it is clear that placing a <0x24>200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to the police daily and maintained his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
An 11-year-old pedophile used her phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online communication service where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg’s sleeping hand.
The girl searched her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police came in, they saw five photos, searched the computers on site, and found "concerning" web searches using keywords used to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to entice paedophiles" on the Internet before pretending to be a policeman to scare them.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on a computer, but said that they were done only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as about when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He says he's sick of his head after drinking, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When she found the pictures on her phone, she was screaming at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the obscene photos on the phone and then faced the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year, broke his warrant on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element."
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed the verdict until October to give Social Services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's in custody before trial.
He was added to the sex offenders registry before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gives wrong speech to parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell earlier this year in the staircase leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
Parliament’s opening ceremony was also stained by allegations by opposition lawmakers that anonymous death threats had been sent to them warning them not to boo at Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed him up and interrupted him in interludes as he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that parliamentary immunity would end and that when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
A group disciplinary supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “concerned” about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has planned to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the fast-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
Expected job cuts will bring about <0x24>2.7 billion in expenses starting from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of HP, who will lead the division after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help businesses transition to a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a stand-alone company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual turnover of more than <0x24>50 billion and will “focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions for companies,” the company said in a statement.
The division dismantles the company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical supplies in a garage in Palo Alto called "The Place of the Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive reorganisation to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second-largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, and its division is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that firms with strict limitations perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it’s only September and assuming he’s rehabilitated as planned, there’s no reason why he won’t be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four English games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere’s last season ended strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of further injuries when a player tries to return mid-season.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different disabilities since his debut six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games.
When looking at Arsenal’s overall performance since the 2007–08 season, six out of eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to disability.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their improvement in disability statistics for the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury, there can be a prone season when you need to strengthen the body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body stabilizes, I’m sure that will happen, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to roll his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely in the beginning.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a break to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear successor to Group F, Maksimir’s stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons from last season's surrender of the Champions League against Monaco and is motivated by the still distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup win.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not appear in series, especially considering that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate of young men is higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year for Men, with the aim of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 secondary school-age students who showed symptoms of depression found that a person’s chances of recovering were doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of their friends were “healthy.”
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of mental health problems was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for a friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes the content, and the immediacy of the response is often more important than the meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, while in reality isolation prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - the inner longing for personal growth and friendship - that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t make you happier.
The greatness of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all this, even though they often hesitate to explore their emotions completely.
As a Samaritan volunteer explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how the slightest interaction with a friend can make me feel better."
Men who contact us often feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of “overcoming” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my impartial, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you’re going to come to Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the shooting venues have been redesigned to celebrate the festival, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a coffee?
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria, with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal for less than four minutes in her Champions League debut, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team missed several opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored at the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a continuation in the game, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But despite PSG's losing points, it was not a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Laurent Blanc's team, lost a spot in front of the goal and was later replaced on the pitch. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win is a problem for the opponent and looks good in the stats, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is a good prediction.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after being injured in one of the three changes, after the team was left 2-2 in the home game of Ligue 1 against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was left behind by Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he left Manchester United last month, the Argentine forward was named the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind the Malmö line of defense and then hit a beautiful finishing Johan Wiland past the back of the net.
“If anyone expected a big and easy win from PSG, he would be disappointed.
Malmö was a congested opponent. It won the Celtic in the final match when it reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense in the opening field, as well as two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than a shot by Nikola Djurdjic in the 34th minute, which passed Kevin Trapp's goal pole.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to missed passes and poor finishes, especially for Ibrahimovic, who failed five attempts in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in the preliminary work for his colleagues, and it was after Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent a spiral kick, which tipped around Wiland's goal pole at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play by Uruguayan Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had pushed Maxwell's cross pass forward from the left.
That ended Malmö's hopes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's direct kick kept the final scores down before Ezequiel Lavezz's goal was discarded at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December of last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
I'll take my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises <0x24>2.5 billion by selling shares
The Swiss-based mining industry left Glencore, which suffered from a crunch in commodity prices, raised <0x24>2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold some <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown strains demand and causes devastation in all markets.
The new subscription raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69% higher.
Last week, Glencore revealed a <0x24>2.5 billion stock deal as part of a broader plan to cut its <0x24>30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold the new share capital for 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, totalling 9.99 per cent of the Group.
Concerns about a long-term stagnation in China have cut the prices of iron ore by about half, while the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is in response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November.
The president of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, will arrange a dinner for Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
"The visit of Prime Minister Xi will provide an opportunity to broaden cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time, it will give President Obama and President X the opportunity to constructively discuss issues where there is disagreement," the statement said.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is expected to also visit Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet with a number of U.S. technology leaders before moving on to New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased absoluteness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon tries to underestimate differences in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown while they were discussing a difference that, according to Damon, is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, Brown was interrupted by an experienced actor, who stressed the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it is taken into account when selecting actors for a movie, not a series," Damon argued.
Shocked Brown reacted to the injured in disbelief, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while the actor's comments on The Martian were left hanging in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat the Harmony character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore his white pimp hits.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon rudely replied that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Since its release, it has accumulated more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a white police officer killed teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the Album of the Year nominees for a Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently released a statement to answer a question by Fox News television star Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the directors said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon was among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior contest and receive a <0x24>1 million grand prize.
The competition programme, which ended its seventh season, has never had a competitor who has survived all the sections of the obstacle track in the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a 23-metre-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to solve the exhausting fourth installment of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock about winning the <0x24>1 million grand prize.
“So it’s great to think about it, since I’ve never made or lived with anything but <0x24>10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can’t even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten won’t get more reward money, even though he is the first racer ever to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes a life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he's resentful.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to beat me, I’m happy it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have thought the same if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for the eighth season, starting in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role of spoiler perfectly on Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins in the 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to climb halfway through the Houston Astros in a race for a second American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter word H for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two sets, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 in 1/3 and allowed three runs.
This was his third game in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It’s hard for a substitute to pass every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement Victor Martinez was hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first beats since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night after hitting the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He was a good batter," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in punching practice), looked much better in punching practice and continued to do the same in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the tie by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks made his way home at the touch of one hive, and Simon was able to burn Brian Dozier, the second hive, directly before Simon was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against him, ahead of the rookie substitute Miguel Sano, who pulled the two-nest run to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and a levelling runner in second base, VerHagen had third base Trevor Plouffe score the double-game goal.
It was the 27th time in the season that Plouffe beat the doubles.
After Detroit's 9th inning, Mauer scored two beats against Tigers' closing Bruce Rondon, with a score of 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth rescue.
Detroit initially took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being out of the game for more than a month due to an infection in the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I could make some nice passes in the third inning."
After Hughes captured the starter for the first base, he let second base player Ian Kinsler advance in a single interval.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to the punch, who took himself in the midfield to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 tube with the runners in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting right and causing a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was disqualified as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second set and received one fire, two fires from James McCann and two fires from Anthony Gose, one fires from Anthony Gose, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes started to be in the assists, feeding a third inning without running, after which he was replaced by the right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs for six punches and a four-fire walk.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right-handed pitcher, was thrown away due to a stretch in the shoulder of his throwing hand.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder spasm, but was due to return on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's stats for the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts since left-handed David Price was replaced on July 30th.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to a slanted right abdomen.
The Tigers and Twins’ three-game series will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) takes a stand against Minnesota's right-hand pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for broader opening of the economy to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attract foreign funding and expertise and develop a policy of openness," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group on Deepening General Reform.
Supporting openness while pushing reforms forward will increase new movement and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, which include a negative list of restrictions on market access, a loosening of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies in which investment is not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensure a legally based business environment and make the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide for themselves how they conduct their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up state-controlled sectors to private investors, more sectors will be opened up.
"The government will not change its stance on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, "green carden", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement published after the meeting.
